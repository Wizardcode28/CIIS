Why did I Feel like an outsider in a place I consider home?,1qg2oil,3,0,2026-01-18 07:56:21,Apprehensive_Art464,Northeastindia,"I’m Rajbongshi. I'm going to share my experience here.

For those who don’t know, Rajbongshis are an ethnic community with deep historical and cultural roots across North Bengal, Assam, and parts of the Northeast, Bhutan and Nepal as well. Our identity doesn’t fit neatly into modern political or regional boxes. We’ve existed long before today’s ‘mainland vs Northeast’ narratives, yet we’re often erased by both.

Growing up in coochbehar, west bengal, I've frequently been reduced to ‘just another bengali’  by many outsiders here. Many people have always assumed my language, culture, even my worldview without ever asking me, some people in Delhi NCR, when I went there last year, also have asked me after knowing my ethnicity, why I even live in North Bengal instead of Assam or even Bangladesh, as if identity must obey state borders, and honestly it’s exhausting. 

Recently, 3 months ago, I went to Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh for my work purposes. I went there with a sense of familiarity, even belonging, because my family history, culture and identity are intertwined with northeast india, assam, parts of meghalaya, Bhutan and Nepal.

What I experienced there hurt me deeply. 

In everyday interactions with locals there, I was treated with almost suspicion. Neither openly hostile, nor violent, but distant, guarded, as if my existence there needed justification. I’m being honest, I've been called a ‘mainland indian’ straight up by a few youths there, and they told me to go back to my land. I was mocked subtly at times. I’m not generalizing, there are good people too, who treated me with good manners, but I was mocked enough times for a pattern to emerge, maybe because I don’t have enough mongoloid features. 

I ain’t a mainland Indian, those who call me are naive at their best. I'm Rajbongshi which is literally a borderline civilization, like a bridge that connects both mainland and northeast India. Disagreement didn’t hurt me there at all, but what hurt me was the feeling of being treated like a stranger in a land I’ve always considered ‘familiar’. 

In Delhi NCR, I’ve been told before that I’m not ‘distinct enough’, and in the northeast, I was made to feel like I was ‘too mainland’. So where does someone like me belong?

Stereotyping is rightly condemned when it’s done to Northeast Indians (we can clearly see it on social media) but when similar generalizations are made about ‘mainland indians’ it just changes the directions, but it never disappears. And people like me get crushed in between. 

Everybody in social media is talking about racism towards northeast people, but why is nobody talking about the racism that occurs here in northeast India too?

I’m not generalizing northeast communities. I’m not attacking Arunachal pradesh or it’s people either, or the locals of Delhi. There are kind, good people everywhere, as well as the fools. Please don’t consider this post about hatred, this is about individual mentality. 

I’m writing this post because identities, ethnicity like mine exist. Many of us live in borderline spaces, carrying histories that don’t fit clean slogans. And we literally disappear when conversations reduce to ‘mainland’ or ‘northeast’.

I myself feel ashamed that I even have to write like this, but someone had to break the stereotypes. Because if we want to move beyond stereotypes, then the mainland vs northeast bullshit needs to stop, on both sides.

Why I believe india won’t progress anytime soon,1qg29fw,9,16,2026-01-18 07:31:07,vexx1d,AskIndianWomen,"Why I believe India won’t progress and why women will remain unsafe

Disclaimer. If you are a religious extremist, do not engage. This is not for you.

India’s condition is no longer hidden. From the surge in rape cases and the near absence of safety for women to air pollution so severe that international athletes have withdrawn from events, the problems are visible and global.

Indians are among the most mocked communities worldwide, and racial crimes against Indians continue to rise. Yet instead of confronting the reasons, we keep deflecting. The uncomfortable truth is that India is deeply divided, and religion plays a major role in that division.

This is not an attack on belief in God. The issue is religious obsession and intolerance. Many people are not extremists in practicing their faith but are extremists in hating other religions. Religion has become more important to people than unity, empathy, or even the nation itself.

There is no real unity among Indians. Society is fragmented by religion, caste, color, and gender. The government reinforces these divisions instead of addressing core social problems.

A country that places religion above nationhood is bound to stagnate.

Now consider countries that perform significantly better in terms of quality of life, safety, social mindset, and development.

Sweden is largely secular, with religion being mostly cultural.

Iceland has very low belief, and churches function mainly as tradition.

Denmark shows high non belief and rational governance.

Norway is officially Christian but socially atheist.

Finland has low religious involvement in public life.

The Netherlands treats belief as personal, not social or political.

China is officially atheist.

These countries are not perfect, and they have their own flaws. But the pattern is clear. When religion does not dominate laws, politics, or social control, societies function better.

As long as India gives more importance to religion, caste, color, and gender than to real issues such as women’s safety, rising sexual violence, caste discrimination, extreme inequality, mental health stigma, everyday corruption, unemployment, poor quality public education, a weak justice system, and patriarchy beyond physical violence, India will not progress.

This is not hate.

This is pattern recognition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1qg29fw/why_i_believe_india_wont_progress_anytime_soon/
God helps those who are helpless: Understanding the difference between petty desires and Divine necessities,1qg24up,1,1,2026-01-18 07:23:45,Rajeshk1235,selfhelp,"A devotee of Vishnu was walking along singing hymns. He was so engrossed in his singing that he didn’t even realize that he had walked all over the clothes that were laid on the rocks by the washermen for drying. The washermen see him and start shouting. Vishnu was at home in his bedroom with his wife, he suddenly gets up, puts on his shirt and tells his wife, my devotee is in trouble and I must go and help him. He leaves but almost immediately comes back. His surprised wife asks him why he is back so soon and Vishnu tells her, the washermen ran after my devotee with bamboo sticks but my devotee also picked up a stone to fight back.

 God helps those who are truly in a helpless situation but what is helplessness is God’s understanding and not our own. No amount of pleading with God will help. Even the help takes time to come, God still has to get up from his bed, put on his shirt, inform his wife and it does happen at times that there are more important things to do at home and his wife refuses to let him go. As Nisargadatta had said, If, the power that has created you, wants to keep you going then it sends help and we know them as coincidences. To most people coincidence might seem to be just that, a mere coincidence but to those, who have been in a hopeless situation for a very long time, they certainly would have lost count of all the ‘coincidences’.

 All existence is one and it helps itself. The singularity or God experiences life through us, a mere instrument in his hands. With perfect knowledge, the singularity is whole, complete and in harmony with itself, but we live our lives; do all our work, make decisions on the basis of imperfect knowledge and this is the cause of all our suffering. Unfortunately there is no perfection in manifestation and the only way we have to alleviate our sufferings is through a complete surrender to the will of God. Accept all outcomes and nothing ever becomes a cause of distress.

Surrender is neither mechanical nor passive and hence Hindus use a different word, sacrifice. A Hindu actively sacrifices all his thoughts and actions as an offering to god. What is sacrificed also includes what most people often forget, their grief, sorrow, misery that comes from  imperfect knowledge, lower understanding and a Hindu sacrifices them for a higher understanding. A Hindu, transcending religion, ethnicity seeks to emulate God, a God who has no fancies, desires of his own and this is also the true significance of the above story. God only does what is necessary. This could also be the lesson of the Jesus Christ parable, The Good Samaritan.

 A man was lying on the side of the road badly wounded. A Priest and later the Levite see him but ignore and walk away, but the Good Samaritan helps 

The Priest and the Levite weren’t Jews as the believers think them to be, instead as a Hindu would understand, they are the institutions structured to dole out help in general but this doesn’t always help an individual with specific needs. Perhaps this  could be the only way an institution can function so this is not a complaint. In addition there would be motives behind the help, religion’s own agenda, political ambition, publicity seeking or if nothing else there is always the petty ideology of liberalism with a racket to boot.

 Mother Theresa was very ‘helpful’ seeking a place for herself in heaven. She couldn’t believe despite all her efforts there were still Hindus who hadn’t accepted Christian names and the worst was; God who was doing nothing to help. Her motives didn’t allow her to find peace in her work nor feel the presence of God as a guide in her life. No wonder she lived and died a miserable woman leaving behind an institution with misery as its trademark.

 Is Samaritan as an individual more likely to offer true help? Yes. But if this was the only lesson of the parable then it would be a useless truism and this can’t be true of a Jesus Christ parable. There is very little that an individual or an institution can do to help. Everybody lives in their own world of desires and understanding and there can be almost no meaningful communication between the seeker and giver of help with different motives and understanding of their own and as it happens, more often than not, it leaves both of them frustrated. All necessary help comes from God and we are the delivery agents who bring the help to the needy. A ‘coincidence’. The very thought,  I helped,  raises the ego mind and with it desire for rewards, recognition and a delusion sets in the mind. All larger than life fantasies of helping the world always end up in a way that fulfills one of our own petty desires. Find out the next time  you indulge in one.

 So who was the Samaritan? Our mind and the Good Samaritan, a purified mind. A mind that has dropped all desires, motives of its own, makes room for the inherent urge to know what is true to manifest, A Good Shepherd who is willing to leave behind the comfortable world of beliefs, fancies; the 99 sheep, to go and find that one lost sheep: Ekam Sat-One Truth. This purified mind seeks to walk on a path lit by the light of truth with God as his guide, singularity’s perfectly working instrument, God’s delivery person.

 And who was the man laying on the side of the road badly wounded? Samaritan’s own body. Charity begins at home. What is true and necessary is learning and there can be no better way to learn than from what comes when we help ourselves, a body we know so intimately. To know the difference between the needs of the body and petty desires that end up as gluttony, lust, greed, vice etc. The true understanding of what is necessary prepares us to be God's delivery agent. 

An easier to understand is the verse from Yoga Sutras.

‘Cultivate friendship towards your happiness, a compassion towards your miseries,

 a gladness towards your virtues and an indifference towards your vices.

This will purify your mind.’

Love yourself like you would love someone your very own, be a mother to yourself. This love without motives will grow and become all encompassing.

So again, what is true help? An often given example in India is that of a person sleeping next to you and is obviously suffering a nightmare; do we go inside their nightmare and fight whatever is scaring them?  No. we just wake them up, but to do that we ourselves have to be awake, like Jesus Christ was and all his teachings are a guide for our own spiritual awakening. To wake up to what is real and true.

The parable was told by Jesus Christ in response to a question by a lawyer who wanted to know, how to achieve immortality, perfection? ‘I am the way’. The road to immortality is through an awakened mind, a purified mind, the mind of the Good Samaritan,. The Good Shepard, from learning from within, comes so easily to a mind that isn’t clouded by its own motives, beliefs, fancies, and instead is a seeker of what is true. A Hindu or a seeker mind.

A report about India's strategic withdrawal from Iran's Chabahar port triggered a political slugfest between the Congress and the BJP. Experts suggest the Chabahar story is less about an exit and more about managing strategic ambition under Trump sanctions.,1qg1u3w,1,2,2026-01-18 07:06:26,Competitive_Gene_898,IndiaSpeaks,"In the last few days, reports and opinions suggesting that India has been forced to ""withdraw"" from Iran's Chabahar port under US pressure have been doing rounds. This has triggered a political slugfest at home. A report in a leading financial newspaper on Thursday (January 15) noted that ""India's decade-old, turbulent involvement in developing Iran's Chabahar port has collapsed after US President Donald Trump said on January 12 that any country doing business with the Persian Gulf nation will face a 25% tariff on any and all business being done with the USA.""

The Congress alleged that ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi had surrendered to US President Donald Trump, compromising a key national interest. The BJP hit back, calling the charge ""pure fiction"" and accused the Congress of peddling lies. It shared a clip from the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Randhir Jaiswal, stating the Centre's stand on the matter.

A day after the report was published, the MEA clarified that India continues to operate at Chabahar under a valid US sanctions waiver till April 26, 2026. The MEA said New Delhi is engaged with Washington DC to extend and operationalise the arrangement.

India has always operated in Chabahar in the shadow of US sanctions on Iran. The report came at a time when Washington has toughened its posture on Tehran. It has prompted speculation that India might be forced to scale back or recalibrate its role on the port on Iran's Makran Coast.

Chabahar, located in southeastern Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province. It sits just outside the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global energy chokepoint. For India, the port is strategically invaluable. It provides a direct maritime route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, completely bypassing Pakistan. It is also a key node in the International North–South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which links Mumbai to Russia and Europe via Iran.",https://i.redd.it/951f24pl42eg1.jpeg

Best VPNs for Etsy,1qg125b,1,0,2026-01-18 06:23:21,ContentByrkRahul,VPNforFreedom,"Your Etsy account just got flagged. Again. You weren't doing anything wrong—just logged in from a coffee shop while traveling. But Etsy's automated system saw an unusual IP address and hit the panic button. Now you're locked out, unable to fulfill orders or manage your shop.

This exact scenario plays out thousands of times daily for Etsy sellers and buyers. The platform's aggressive fraud detection doesn't distinguish between actual threats and legitimate users protecting their privacy or accessing their accounts from different locations.

Here's the reality: Etsy **does** detect VPNs, and using the wrong one can get your account suspended. But the right VPN? It lets you access Etsy securely from anywhere, protect sensitive payment data, and avoid geo-restrictions—without triggering those dreaded security flags.

I've spent the past year testing 20+ VPNs specifically with Etsy, analyzing which ones work reliably and which ones get accounts flagged. This guide breaks down everything I learned, including the three VPNs that consistently bypassed Etsy's detection while keeping seller accounts safe.

✅ **Quick Answer**

The best VPN for Etsy is **NordVPN**. It offers residential-like IP addresses, consistent server locations, and strong encryption that protects your Etsy transactions without triggering account flags. For sellers managing shops while traveling or buyers in restricted regions, NordVPN provides the reliability Etsy demands.

# Why You Need a VPN for Etsy

Etsy isn't technically ""blocked"" in most countries, but that doesn't mean you won't run into access issues. Whether you're a seller managing inventory or a buyer hunting for handmade goods, there are several compelling reasons to use a VPN with Etsy.

# Etsy's VPN Detection Problem

Let's address the elephant in the room: Etsy actively monitors for VPN usage. The platform employs sophisticated detection systems that flag accounts showing suspicious patterns. What makes this frustrating is that ""suspicious"" often means perfectly legitimate behavior—like accessing your shop from a hotel WiFi or using public internet at a coworking space.

Here's what triggers Etsy's security system:

* **Frequent IP changes** from different countries or cities
* **Shared VPN IP addresses** that multiple users access simultaneously
* **Data center IP addresses** commonly used by cheap VPNs
* **Unusual login patterns** that don't match your typical behavior

I learned this the hard way when testing budget VPNs. One seller reported losing their account after another user on the same VPN server violated Etsy's policies—guilt by IP association. The account remained banned despite appeals.

💡 **Pro Tip**

Residential IP VPNs work significantly better with Etsy than data center VPNs. They mimic real home internet connections, making it nearly impossible for Etsy to distinguish VPN traffic from normal browsing. Premium VPNs like NordVPN and Surfshark include residential-style servers in their networks.

# Geo-Restrictions and Blocked Countries

While Etsy operates globally, several countries face complete blocks or severe restrictions:

|Country|Etsy Status|Reason|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cuba|❌ Blocked|US trade embargo|
|Iran|❌ Blocked|Government censorship + sanctions|
|Syria|❌ Blocked|US sanctions|
|Belarus|❌ Blocked|Sanctions|
|Russia|❌ Blocked|Trade restrictions|
|India|⚠️ Partial|Sellers can't open new shops|

If you're traveling to these regions or live there, you need a VPN to access your Etsy account normally. The same applies to sellers who've relocated but need to maintain their original shop location for tax compliance.

# Security for Etsy Sellers and Buyers

This is where VPNs truly shine—protecting sensitive data during transactions.

**For sellers**, Etsy shops handle:

* Payment processing information
* Customer addresses and personal details
* Business banking data
* Tax information
* Inventory and pricing strategies

**For buyers**, every purchase involves:

* Credit card or PayPal credentials
* Shipping addresses
* Purchase history and browsing patterns

Public WiFi is a nightmare for this kind of data. Hackers love coffee shop networks. They sit there with packet sniffers, intercepting unencrypted traffic. Without a VPN encrypting your connection, every login credential and payment detail travels across the network in plain view.

I tested this vulnerability at a local café. With basic network monitoring tools (legally, on my own traffic), I could see exactly which websites I visited and when I logged into accounts—all without a VPN. The moment I connected to NordVPN, everything became encrypted gibberish to any potential eavesdropper.

⚠️ **Warning**

Free VPNs are particularly dangerous for Etsy use. Many log your browsing data and sell it to advertisers. Worse, they often use IP addresses already blacklisted by Etsy, meaning instant account suspension. The ""free"" savings aren't worth losing your seller account.

# Best VPNs for Etsy [Top 3 Tested]

After extensive testing, three VPNs consistently delivered reliable Etsy access without triggering security flags. Each excels in different scenarios, so your best choice depends on whether you're primarily selling, buying, or both.

# 1. NordVPN - Best Overall for Etsy

**Pricing:** $3.39/month (2-year plan) | **Servers:** 8,800+ in 129 countries | **Connections:** 10 devices

NordVPN earned the top spot for one simple reason: it just works with Etsy. No account flags. No suspicious activity warnings. Just consistent, reliable access whether you're managing a shop from Tokyo or browsing handmade goods from Buenos Aires.

**What makes NordVPN ideal for Etsy:**

During my testing, I connected to NordVPN servers in 15 different countries over six weeks while managing a test Etsy seller account. Zero flags. Zero verification requests. The account operated exactly as if I'd never moved.

The secret is NordVPN's server infrastructure. With 8,800+ servers across 129 countries, you're never stuck using a crowded, blacklisted IP address. When one server gets too congested or flagged, you've got dozens of alternatives in the same region.

NordVPN's **NordLynx protocol** (their implementation of WireGuard) maintains speeds that don't hurt your workflow. I uploaded product photos—high-resolution images that can be 5-10MB each—and the process felt identical to my regular home connection. Average upload speeds on nearby servers hit 400+ Mbps.

The **Threat Protection** feature blocks malicious websites and ads, crucial for sellers clicking on promotional links or buyers hunting deals across multiple Etsy shops. It's prevented me from landing on at least three phishing sites disguised as Etsy login pages.

✅ **Pros:**

* Massive server network prevents IP overcrowding
* NordLynx protocol offers excellent speeds for uploading/downloading
* Audited no-logs policy protects seller and buyer data
* Double VPN available for extra sensitive transactions
* 30-day money-back guarantee for testing

❌ **Cons:**

* Higher monthly price if you don't commit to long-term plans
* Occasional server connection drops (rare but happens)
* More servers than you'll probably ever need

🏆 **Winner for:** Etsy sellers who need reliable access while traveling, buyers in restricted regions, anyone handling sensitive transactions.

# 2. Surfshark - Best Budget VPN for Etsy Sellers

**Pricing:** $1.99/month (2-year plan) | **Servers:** 4,500+ in 100 countries | **Connections:** Unlimited

Budget doesn't mean inferior. Surfshark punches way above its price point, especially for Etsy sellers running multiple devices simultaneously.

The unlimited device connections sold me immediately. Most VPNs cap you at 5-10 devices. Surfshark? Connect your laptop, phone, tablet, desktop, and even your partner's devices—all under one subscription. For seller households where multiple people manage the shop, this is a game-changer.

I ran Surfshark on seven devices simultaneously: two laptops, three phones, and two tablets. No speed degradation. No connection issues. Every device maintained stable Etsy access.

**Why Surfshark works well for Etsy:**

Surfshark's **CleanWeb** feature aggressively blocks trackers and ads. This matters more than you'd think for Etsy sellers. The platform already tracks your every move for analytics—adding third-party trackers from ads just compounds the data collection. CleanWeb strips that away.

The **MultiHop** feature (double VPN) routes your connection through two different countries. Overkill for casual browsing, but perfect for sellers handling competitor research or buyers who want absolute anonymity when shopping.

At $1.99/month for the 2-year plan, Surfshark costs about what you'd spend on two coffees. That's ridiculous value for unlimited device protection.

✅ **Pros:**

* Unbeatable price for long-term plans
* Unlimited simultaneous connections (rare in premium VPNs)
* Solid speeds for most Etsy tasks
* CleanWeb blocks aggressive tracking
* Works reliably with Etsy's detection systems

❌ **Cons:**

* Smaller server network than NordVPN
* Some distant servers show noticeable speed drops
* Customer support response times vary

💰 **Money-Saving Tip**

Surfshark's 2-year plan at $1.99/month is currently one of the best VPN deals available. The monthly price jumps to $15.45—nearly an 8x increase. If you're committed to using a VPN with Etsy long-term, the 2-year option saves you over $300 compared to paying monthly.

# 3. Private Internet Access - Best for Multiple Devices

**Pricing:** $2.19/month (2-year plan) | **Servers:** 35,000+ in 91 countries | **Connections:** Unlimited

PIA (Private Internet Access) boasts the most servers of any VPN—35,000+. That's not a typo. Thirty-five thousand. For Etsy users, this translates to virtually zero chance of connecting to a blacklisted or overcrowded server.

**PIA's Etsy advantages:**

The sheer server count means you'll always find a fast, clean IP address. I tested PIA across two months of daily Etsy use, switching servers frequently to simulate the behavior that typically triggers flags. Not once did Etsy question my account.

PIA's **MACE** feature blocks ads, trackers, and malware at the DNS level. It's similar to NordVPN's Threat Protection or Surfshark's CleanWeb, but I found it slightly more aggressive—particularly effective at blocking those annoying Etsy promoted listings that clutter search results.

The US jurisdiction concerns some privacy advocates (the company is based in Colorado). However, PIA has proven its no-logs claims in court multiple times. When authorities served warrants demanding user data, PIA had nothing to hand over.

For Etsy sellers managing multiple shop accounts (allowed under Etsy's terms if you're not evading bans), PIA's unlimited connections and massive server network make it ideal.

✅ **Pros:**

* 35,000+ servers virtually eliminates IP blacklisting risks
* Unlimited simultaneous device connections
* Open-source code builds trust
* Proven no-logs policy (tested in court)
* MACE blocks aggressive tracking and ads

❌ **Cons:**

* US jurisdiction may concern some users
* Server speeds vary more than NordVPN
* Interface less polished than competitors

🔒 **Security Note**

PIA's open-source code is available on GitHub for anyone to inspect. This transparency is rare in the VPN industry and builds significant trust. If a VPN claims to protect your privacy but won't show you how it works, that's a red flag.

# How to Use a VPN with Etsy (Step-by-Step)

Using a VPN with Etsy requires a specific approach to avoid triggering security flags. Follow these steps exactly as outlined—I've tested this method extensively, and it works.

**Step 1: Choose Your VPN Location Strategically**

Don't randomly select servers. Pick a location that makes sense for your Etsy account:

* **Sellers:** Connect to the country where your shop is registered. If you registered in the US, use US servers.
* **Buyers:** Connect to your actual location or the region where you normally shop.
* **Travelers:** Use servers in your home country to maintain consistency.

The key is **consistency**. Etsy's algorithm looks for erratic patterns. Jumping between Germany, Japan, and Brazil in the same day screams ""suspicious activity.""

**Step 2: Connect to Your VPN Before Opening Etsy**

This matters more than you'd think. Connect to NordVPN (or your chosen VPN) **first**, then navigate to Etsy. This ensures your connection is fully encrypted from the start, preventing any data leaks during the initial connection.

I tested both methods: connecting after opening Etsy vs. before. The after approach resulted in two ""unusual activity"" warnings over a month. The before approach? Zero warnings.

**Step 3: Clear Your Browser Cookies (First Time Only)**

Etsy stores cookies that remember your location and connection details. If you've previously accessed Etsy without a VPN, these cookies conflict with your new VPN IP address, triggering flags.

Clear cookies in Chrome:

1. Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data
2. Select ""Cookies and other site data""
3. Click ""Clear data""

You only need to do this once before your first VPN connection to Etsy.

**Step 4: Enable Your VPN's Kill Switch**

A kill switch cuts your internet connection if the VPN drops. This prevents Etsy from seeing your real IP address during a connection failure.

In NordVPN: Settings > General > Enable Kill Switch In Surfshark: Settings > VPN settings > Kill Switch In PIA: Settings > Connection > Enable Kill Switch

**Step 5: Stick to One Server Location**

This is critical for sellers. Choose one server in your target country and use it consistently. Don't server-hop between New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Pick one city and stick with it.

I maintained the same New York server for an entire month while testing. Zero account issues. When I switched between servers daily, I received an ""unusual activity"" email within a week.

⚡ **Performance Insight**

Servers geographically closer to you deliver faster speeds. If you're in Europe accessing a US-registered Etsy shop, use a US East Coast server (like New York) rather than West Coast (like Los Angeles). The reduced latency makes a noticeable difference when uploading photos or processing orders.

# Tips to Avoid Getting Flagged on Etsy

Etsy's security system is trigger-happy. Here's how to use a VPN without setting off alarms:

**Use Residential-Style IPs When Possible**

Data center IPs get flagged faster than residential IPs. Premium VPNs like NordVPN include residential IP options or servers that mimic residential connections. These are harder for Etsy to detect as VPN traffic.

**Don't Log In From Multiple Countries Daily**

Etsy knows humans don't teleport. If you're in Germany at 9 AM and suddenly in Japan at 10 AM, you're getting flagged. Maintain logical travel patterns if you must change locations.

**Disable GPS on Mobile Devices**

Your phone's GPS can conflict with your VPN location. If your VPN says you're in New York but your GPS says you're in London, Etsy notices the discrepancy. Either disable location services or use your VPN's GPS spoofing feature (available in some premium VPNs).

**Avoid Free VPNs Entirely**

Free VPNs use overcrowded servers with blacklisted IP addresses. I tested three popular free VPNs with Etsy—all three resulted in account verification requests within 24 hours. One account was temporarily suspended.

**Keep Your VPN Connected Consistently**

Don't toggle your VPN on and off during a single session. If Etsy sees your IP address changing mid-session, it assumes your account was compromised. Stay connected for the entire time you're using Etsy.

# Countries Where Etsy Has Restrictions

Not all geo-restrictions are equal. Here's the complete breakdown:

|Region|Restriction Level|Details|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Cuba**|Complete block|US trade embargo prevents all access|
|**Iran**|Complete block|Government censorship + international sanctions|
|**Syria**|Complete block|US sanctions block platform access|
|**Belarus**|Complete block|Recent sanctions due to political situation|
|**Russia**|Complete block|Trade restrictions after Ukraine conflict|
|**India**|Seller restrictions|Buyers can access; new sellers cannot open shops|
|**China**|Inconsistent|Great Firewall causes sporadic access issues|

If you're in any of these countries and need Etsy access, a VPN is non-negotiable. NordVPN and Surfshark both offer obfuscated servers that can bypass even China's Great Firewall.

🎯 **Bottom Line**

For countries with complete blocks, use servers in neighboring regions with no restrictions. For example, if you're in Russia, connect to servers in Poland, Latvia, or Finland. Closer servers = better speeds.

# Final Verdict: Best VPN for Etsy

If you're serious about protecting your Etsy account, seller data, or buyer privacy, a premium VPN isn't optional—it's essential. Free VPNs create more problems than they solve, cheap VPNs get your account flagged, and going without a VPN on public WiFi is asking for trouble.

After testing 20+ VPNs with Etsy over the past year, **NordVPN** remains my top recommendation for most users. The combination of reliable access, fast speeds, and residential-style IP addresses makes it the safest choice for both sellers and buyers. At $3.39/month for the 2-year plan, you're getting premium protection for less than a coffee.

For budget-conscious sellers managing multiple devices, **Surfshark** at $1.99/month is an absolute steal. Unlimited connections and solid performance make it perfect for households where several people manage the Etsy shop.

And if you need the absolute largest server network with unlimited connections, **Private Internet Access** at $2.19/month delivers 35,000+ servers to choose from, virtually eliminating any risk of connecting to flagged IP addresses.

All three VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so test them with your Etsy account risk-free. Pick one, stick to consistent server locations, and enjoy secure Etsy access from anywhere in the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qg125b/best_vpns_for_etsy/
Is China threatening the US hegemony absolute bullshit?,1qg089i,0,35,2026-01-18 05:38:55,ProfessionalSite7368,stupidquestions,"I passively see alot of news relating to geopolitics towards China's development as an economic hub. For instance, China is expanding trade routes through Pakistan, making significant investment in Asia, and more recently we see pressure against Taiwan's independence. To add, China is brought up as a contender in the supremacy to control the anticipated Arctic trade routes. I often see the blank statement that China has the largest middle-class population in the world.



This gave me the impression and an implication that China as a whole is also becoming an intellectual powerhouse that rivals and threatens US hegemony... When it's not.



I ran some numbers (by asking grok/hence why /stupidquestions). If we believe official national statistics publications from China, then we believe that the middle class earns $3000-$7500USD annually. However, if one were more skeptical and did a deeper dive, one would find [sources that tell us that nearly half of Chinese citizens earn $140USD a month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/1csfk7l/comment/l462vd9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 



Which is what I want to discuss. the ladder figure puts China's income distribution more in-line with India, for reference, of whom earn \~$350USD monthly per the median. Yes this is cherry picking numbers. But it doesn't really matter. China faces structural issues which will forever cripple their ability to relate to free nations. They don't have policies that enforce and uplift their population, they don't even have a minimum wage. They aren't a serious nation; they remain a paper tiger with insane amounts of human capital regarding their position on the world stage. I just don't believe China should be taken seriously and going forward, I intend to ignore any news I hear relating to China in economics or politics. It's as much meme worthy as India becoming a superpower. I think people are led to believe that China is following the economic miracle, which entails uplifting it's populace out of exteme poverty, and I think people assumed they'd reach modernization to the standard that we saw Japan and all without direct intervention from the West. But It's just bullshit. Again, I intend to view China with the same level of integrity that I give India. China has never bothered to give its people respect, dignity and integrity. They are ripe with corruption, and I don't see this changing. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidquestions/comments/1qg089i/is_china_threatening_the_us_hegemony_absolute/

Every few months, there’s a new article celebrating Gen Z as bold, disruptive, politically aware, digitally fluent. But when you look closely, the faces, voices, and stories being amplified are strikingly familiar. I want to discuss why I think this entire buzz around Gen Z is nothing but a convenient name for upper caste entitlement in India.  
  
They are English-speaking, urban, upper caste, institutionally protected young people who already had access to the internet, good schools, global exposure, and the confidence to be heard without consequences.  
  
Often this socio-economic inherited safety gets termed as Gen Z “fearlessness”. The freedom to quit jobs, speak up online, challenge authority, or be casually political comes from caste capital, not generational courage.  
  
Meanwhile, Dalit and marginalised young people are still doing the slow, intimate work of unlearning fear. Learning to make eye contact while speaking. Learning that their voice will not automatically invite punishment. Learning that confidence is not arrogance when it comes from them.  
  
So yes, ""Gen Z"" is nothing but a caste filtered imagination of youth, where privilege is called progressiveness.  
  
Curious to hear how others are reading this moment, especially from outside elite urban bubbles.

Albert Einstein - a Zionist Activist,1qfx3h4,28,50,2026-01-18 03:03:36,BizzareRep,IsraelPalestine,"Albert Einstein the Zionist

Albert Einstein was a Zionist. A German Jew who was ejected from Germany by the Nazis, Einstein viewed the founding of the state of Israel as a very good thing. He was a sort of a Zionist lobbyist. 

Indeed, Einstein lobbied for the creation of the state, as proposed in the UN General Assembly partition plan of 1947. The Arabs of course rejected the plan. Einstein passionately endorsed partition. 

In the months preceding the vote for partition, Einstein wrote a letter to India’s prime minister, pleading for India to vote for partition. Einstein is often described as an “anti Zionist,” but some of the things written by him to the Indian leader would be considered “far right” by today’s leftists.

In the letter, Einstein essentially says - there is no Palestinian people. They’re part of an Arab nation. The Arabs have many lands. The Jews just want a tiny piece of the land. 

He wrote to India’s prime minister

 “At the close of world war 1, 99% of the vast, underpopulated territories liberated from the Turks by the Allies were set aside for the national aspirations of the Arabs. Five independent Arab states have since been established in these territories.Only 1% was reserved for the Jewish people in the land of their origin. The decision which led to the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration was not arbitrary, nor the choice of territory capricious. It took into account the needs and aspirations of both Arab and Jew, and certainly, the lion’s share did not fall to the Jews. In the august scale of justice,which weighs need against need, there is not doubt as to whose is more heavy.  The “small notch” in the land of their fathers, granted the Jewish people, somewhat redresses the balance.” 

Einstein endorses the Balfour Declaration, universally viewed by radical leftists as evil, while saying “the Arabs have many states and they’re vast. The Jews only want one state in their ancient homeland”. 
Source: 
https://hvk.org/2017/0717/18.html 

Einstein’s Zionist lobbying continued after the founding of the state. In the 1950s, Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, offered Einstein to become Israel’s president. Ben Gurion and Einstein were quite close. Both were Zionist and both were socialists. While Einstein was more socialistic than Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion were unironically socialist (Ben Gurion actually visited the Soviet Union once and spoke highly of Lenin. Ben Gurion later claimed his wife, Paula Ben Gurion, had a crush of Leon Trotsky when she was a young Jewish anarchist in New York City). 

Ben Gurion would not have offered the presidency to a man who he didn’t think with a 100% certainty was not worthy of it as a Zionist. 

Einstein politely declined. “I’m a scientist, not a politician,” he told Ben Gurion. 

Nevertheless, Einstein’s Zionist activism continued. In 1955, he was slated to read a speech on the radio in favor of Israel.

The speech was written by no other than Abba Eben, one of Israel’s most prominent diplomats. The speech condemned Arab hostility towards Israel. It drew a direct line between the Holocaust and Arab states’ aggression towards the Jewish state. A speech written by Abba Eben, this was an unmistakably Zionist speech. 

The speech said: 

“The establishment of this State was internationally approved and recognised largely for the purpose of rescuing the remnant of the Jewish people from unspeakable horrors of persecution and oppression .  . Thus, the establishment of Israel is an event which actively engages the conscience of this generation,” he continued. “It is, therefore, a bitter paradox to find that a State which was destined to be a shelter for a martyred people is itself threatened by grave dangers to its own security. The universal conscience cannot be indifferent to such peril” 

Einstein strongly condemned Israel’s critics: “It is anomalous that world opinion should only criticize Israel’s response to hostility and should not actively seek to bring an end to the Arab hostility which is the root cause of the tension”

To commemorate Einstein’s life and contributions to the Jewish state, Israel printed his image on the 5 Israeli pound bill (Israel’s currency before the shekel was called Israeli pound).

With 48K properties to sell in Bengaluru, clearly showing total dry period. In this case, people use to hurry because they are waiting for such discount and offers for years. But understand sales reached covid level, a total reversal. Price total reversal has not happened. Bengaluru may be worst effected due to prolonged tech recession.

For any investment purchase should be made only after competition of fall, its just starting. Some says self occupancy should not be considered as investment, its foolishness to think so. Flat is making biggest chunk of life. So it need to be seen with investment and ROI. Tomorrow you want to sell everything and go to hometown, you should be able to do.

If sales keep low for few more quarters, price may keep on falling. As geo political tension all time high, I don't see any revival hopes. Unless government intervene and bring back tax breaks. Lower interest rate don't help when base amount is low. Infact on other hand to make price affordable, government should be righting bankruptcy laws as some are eyeing bankruptcy like what happened in Pune in 2014!

What's your call on geopolitical tension, tech revival and government incentives to boost demand?

Continuous fall in sales for an year now.

Update: This post is not intended to say how much it will fall, how long. Because such situation never happened in past. Idea is simply when in quarterly report they see reversal and same is reflecting in actual transection process, then only perfect time to buy.

How do ordinary Chinese people view Maozedong？,1qfwat3,32,87,2026-01-18 02:26:46,Fuzzy-Assistant-7048,China,"Today, I would like to share with you the true image of Chairman Mao in the hearts of ordinary people in mainland China. The answer is — he was a great leader. No matter how foreign media attempts to belittle and insult him, we will not change this view.
I need to correct some of the stereotypes you have about Mao Zedong.
1. The Truth About the Famine
Many people believe that under Mao’s rule, China experienced a severe famine that resulted in the death of millions of people. This narrative has almost painted him as an evil “genocidal dictator,” even more malevolent than Hitler. However, this is not the whole truth. First, I do not deny that a serious famine did occur between 1959 and 1961, and that Mao made some incorrect judgments during that time. But the data surrounding the famine has been exaggerated and distorted, and it was not caused by Mao’s direct orders to seize food. Instead, it was the result of systemic issues leading to long-term malnutrition. Mao himself had neither the motivation nor the ability to create such a vast disaster. This kind of systemic disaster is akin to the large-scale deaths in some countries due to a lack of healthcare; while tragic, it is not something that Mao could be fully blamed for.
If we look at Chinese history, there have been multiple famines throughout the centuries, each resulting in horrific acts like cannibalism. Mao, however, ended the last large-scale famine in China’s history, and after that, China has never experienced such a disaster again.
Many people believe Mao took over a wealthy country, but in reality, he inherited a country devastated by war — ravaged by World War II, civil war, warlord chaos, and foreign invasions. In such a context, disasters were not unexpected. However, despite the poor conditions, Mao ended China’s last major famine. As for the famine’s cause, it wasn’t as simple as some claim — that the mass extermination of sparrows caused a plague of insects. In fact, China did have a “Four Pests Campaign,” targeting rats, flies, mosquitoes, and, initially, sparrows, in an effort to improve hygiene. However, during the famine, the focus shifted to controlling bedbugs. While changing weather patterns might have played a significant role, the most crucial factor was the misallocation of labor toward the production of useless scrap metal. Though this was a mistake, it was not Mao’s personal order. Meanwhile, people were still working in the fields. Not everyone was forced to make iron, but the people’s enthusiasm for labor was low. The real cause of the famine was the “People’s Commune” system, where everyone worked together, harvested grain together, and ate free food. The intention was to provide a society where no one would worry about basic sustenance, but due to its egalitarian design, it made people feel that no matter how much they worked, the outcome would be the same. As a result, food was consumed rapidly, but there was little active labor. This was, in essence, a very idealistic system designed by Mao, but it failed for a variety of reasons. Additionally, natural disasters and the depletion of food reserves, alongside the push for urban industrial development, led to a long-term nutritional deficit. It was a complex problem with multiple contributing factors. One reason Mao asked the youth to make iron was that he was misled by lower-level officials who assured him that there was plenty of food. Mao’s error was trusting this information, though he was a sincere idealist. We should not label him as an evil dictator for this. Otherwise, it would be difficult to understand why Chinese farmers did not rebel against the Communist Party during the Great Famine. In fact, during this period, almost no farmers rebelled because they understood how the food had been depleted. You might say Mao was an idealist, and indeed, he envisioned a country where everyone could eat without paying, not one that would commit genocide. Many foreign commentators erroneously attribute the famine to the extermination of sparrows and the iron-making campaign, and even fabricate the existence of “grain requisition teams” — but these overlook the key issue of the “People’s Commune” system. I suspect they don’t want you to know that Mao implemented such a people-oriented system, as this would shatter the “tyrant” narrative.
2. Mao and the Intellectuals
There is a claim that Mao ordered the humiliation of teachers and people with differing opinions, which indeed occurred to some extent. However, the reality is quite different from the propaganda. Mao was never like other dictators who kept a secret list of political enemies or had a secret police force. In fact, Mao did not order the humiliation of anyone. This was not a top-down purge but rather a call for the masses to actively maintain the socialist system. Most people responded to this call, but some took advantage of the situation to gain political power. They exaggerated and distorted Mao’s instructions, destroying cultural artifacts and humiliating intellectuals (because, in those days, intellectuals were often wealthy). Mao himself trusted the choice of the masses over intellectual reports. He often said that “the eyes of the masses are sharp,” which is why during the years 1966–1976 and 1956, many intellectuals were wrongfully persecuted. However, these actions were not direct orders from Mao but the result of spontaneous actions by the people, some of whom were misled. Mao was not the typical dictator. In fact, one could argue he was one of the most democratic leaders in history. He entrusted the power of decision-making to the people, who, in turn, trusted him and elevated him to the highest position. This was a paradoxical time when, due to mass adoration and Mao’s long-standing correctness as a leader, China’s extreme democracy turned into an equally extreme form of dictatorship. Mao trusted the direct choice of the people but did not believe in electoral democracy, fearing it could be exploited by capitalists. You can’t imagine ordinary people pulling out the head of state to humiliate him — but that happened during Mao’s Cultural Revolution. Clearly, many people were not professional in handling state affairs. Liu Shaoqi, an excellent chairman, was more pragmatic than Mao’s idealism, but this also meant he was more inclined to allow market disparities, which demotivated people. Extremists used this opportunity to rally the masses and eventually led to his death. While this was a tragic mistake, it was the result of extreme democracy. To label Mao as a dictator is absurd.
3. Mao’s Leadership and Achievements
Mao governed China for 30 years and led the revolution for 50 years. During this period, most of his decisions had a decisive impact on China’s fate. He confiscated the land of landlords, ended warlordism and foreign invasions. China’s population grew by about 78%, industrial output increased by about 2922%, total grain production grew by about 169%, and per capita income increased by 200% (though poverty remained). Life expectancy in China, which was about 35 years before the founding of the country, increased to 67.88 years by 1981. The infant mortality rate decreased from about 200‰ to 36‰ in 1981, the illiteracy rate dropped from about 80% at the founding of the country to 52.4% in 1964, and the primary school enrollment rate, which was below 20%, was nearly universal. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, China tied up most of the Japanese military. In the Korean War, China defeated the U.S. military. In the Zhenbao Island conflict, China defeated the Soviet Union, and in the western border conflict with India, China won — but Mao never took a single inch of foreign land. Mao’s policies successfully deterred foreign invasions without ever taking any land for China.
4. Mao’s Life and Character
Mao lived a simple life, and his descendants did not enjoy high official positions or wealth. One of his sons died in the Korean War, just like other ordinary Chinese citizens’ children.
5. Mao Ended a Century of Humiliation
Before Mao, China endured a century of humiliation. Mao not only ended this period but also led the farmers to overthrow the landlords’ oppression.
Indeed, Mao had many shortcomings, but if one truly sets aside stereotypes and takes an honest look at him, they would undoubtedly respect this great and noble leader.

Why Masaan is one of the most important Indian films of the last decade,1qfvgez,33,2,2026-01-18 01:47:50,Active-Course-155,SocialfFilmmakers,"Why Masaan is one of the most important Indian films of the last decade

Masaan matters because it quietly rewired how Indian cinema talks about caste, gender, desire, grief, and modernity without spectacle, saviours, or sermonising. It did not shout revolution. It lived it.

First, Masaan marks a generational shift in social realism. It inherits the moral seriousness of Parallel Cinema but rejects its distance. Earlier films often showed marginalised lives from above. Masaan places us inside them. Deepak is not a symbol of suffering. He is a young man with ambition, humour, desire, and rage. Devi is not a fallen woman asking for redemption. She is a person refusing shame. This movement from representation to subjectivity is what makes the film politically powerful.

Second, the film dismantles the upper caste gaze. Directed by Neeraj Ghaywan, Masaan is not about speaking for the oppressed but speaking from within lived contradictions. The Dom community is not romanticised or reduced to misery. Their labour, dignity, anger, and aspirations are shown as everyday facts. Caste is not portrayed as an abstract evil but as something enforced through police stations, job markets, families, and rituals.

Third, Masaan redefines feminist cinema in India. Devi’s story is not about punishment for sexual transgression but about the violence of moral surveillance. The police raid, blackmail, and appeal to caste honour expose how Brahminical patriarchy works through the state as much as through family. Devi’s strength lies not in rebellion through grand gestures but in endurance, self respect, and economic independence. Her refusal to collapse is the film’s quiet feminist thesis.

Fourth, Varanasi is not a backdrop but a social architecture. Masaan strips the city of postcard spirituality and shows it as a place where tradition and modernity collide daily. Burning ghats function as workplaces. Cafes and Facebook become temporary escape routes from caste policing. Space itself is political. Who can enter where. Who can love where. Who can mourn where. The city shapes every choice the characters make.

Fifth, Masaan understands technology as a double edged force. Facebook enables an inter caste romance without immediate surveillance. The same digital tools enable sexual blackmail and permanent shaming. Modernity does not erase caste. It rearranges how power operates. The film is one of the earliest Indian works to show this with honesty.

Sixth, the film rejects the heroic model of social change. There is no single leader, no climactic victory, no final justice. Change happens through small movements. Education. Leaving a town. Letting go of grief. Choosing to live. This refusal of spectacle is why Masaan feels truthful.

Finally, Masaan matters because it centres impermanence. Set in a crematorium city, the film insists that caste, honour, and cruelty are not eternal even if they pretend to be. Death equalises. Grief connects. Survival itself becomes resistance.

Masaan did not just succeed at Cannes. It changed what Indian independent cinema believed was possible. It proved that stories rooted in caste and gender could travel globally without dilution. It opened space for filmmakers to tell intimate political stories without apology.

Mehta cancels all his performances in Israel as a protest against Netanyahu's policies,1qftm6m,333,77,2026-01-18 00:24:54,Ok-Prompt2360,classicalmusic,"As per the article:

>Legendary conductor Zubin Mehta, who led the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra for nearly 50 years, says that he has canceled all his performances in Israel in protest of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies regarding the Palestinians.

>“I cancelled all my engagements in Israel this year because of my objection to Mr Netanyahu’s way of treating the whole Palestinian issue,” Mehta says in an interview with India Today, adding that he hopes that Netanyahu will be voted out of office at the next elections.

>The 89-year-old Indian maestro cancelled a number of performances in Israel at the end of last year, citing health issues.

What are your thoughts?

I don't like when politics and music get mixed, I remember when the invasion of Ukrain happened and I was at the first representation of Pikovaya dama at La Scala in Milan. When Gergiev entered the room he got booed immediately, even before starting to conduct.

I remember that was unfair artistically speaking, but inevitable politically speaking since Gergiev has always been very close to Putin.

Mehta's case is different. I personally admire him for this choice, for taking a side. He's a legend and has nothing to lose at his age, but still standing for something you believe is right, especially having this long tie with the Israel Philharmonic, sends a strong message of protest against what is happening is Palestine and Israel.

  
I'm curious to know what you think, leaving behind any political belief, and keeping a respectful tone of voice. Thanks!

Suggested Tweaks to India in Victoria 3,1qft9ud,12,1,2026-01-18 00:10:16,Which_Impression4262,victoria3,"I want to start off by saying, I really enjoy the Victoria 3 content for India and I think Paradox has done its research with regards to how to make India content super unique. That being said, I have a few minor tweaks and some criticisms that I think can be worked upon to make India even more fun and accurate. I’ve broken down these criticisms into essentially 2 categories: Characters & Map. So moving alphabetically:

1. **Characters**:  I really enjoy the sheer breadth of characters available to be recruited in India and, in general, I also appreciate how they are used and divided. Nevertheless, I do feel as though there are some key players missing that I would really have liked to see, due to their influence on India, as well as some characters whose ideologies I think could be improved. I will therefore divide this section into two parts: a) **characters that I think need to be added**, and b) **characters that I think need to be fixed**.
   * a) **Characters that I think need to be added:** To start, there is a massive lack of Radical Left and Radical Right characters in India. I understand why there is a lack of radical right characters: most radical right policies favor ethnic supremacy, and in the case of India under the British Raj, the dominant ruling ethnic group is English and religiously Protestant. That would make little sense for Indian figures like Aurobindo Ghosh, who might be more religiously focused but their ideas were rooted in Hinduism not protestant supremacy. From a game mechanics point of view, I can see why that decision was made. My issue is the lack of representation of the radical left. This is strange to me, as India had a robust communist movement in the early 1900s. There was even an attempt to instigate a revolt in 1914 led by Indian leftist Ghadarites. With this in mind, I think India would benefit from the inclusion of two characters who were influential in India:
      * **Manabendra Nath Roy (Communist in Trade Unions or Civil Servants):** Roy is widely regarded as one of the foundational pillars of the communist movement in India, and also in Mexico. He founded both the Communist Party of India and Mexico’s Socialist Party, which became the Communist Party of Mexico two years later. If there is a character who traveled widely and engaged with communist groups across the world, it was Roy. He operated in places like Berlin, Argentina, and China. If someone is missing from the game, it is him
      * **Sahajanand Saraswati (Land Reformer in Ryots):** Initially a nationalist leader, Saraswati became a prominent communist organizer who created the single largest peasant union in India, the All-India Kisan Sabha. The movement began in Bihar with the intent to mobilize peasant grievances against zamindari attacks on occupancy rights, helping spark later farmers’ movements in India. He became a communist in the early 1900s as he began studying Marxism. Without Saraswati, there would be no peasant movement in India, a movement that played a major role in multiple insurgencies in colonial India (the Kisan Sabha movement, No Rent movements, the Tebhaga movement, and others), post-independence India (such as the Hyderabad insurgency), and even modern movements (including the Naxalite movement).
   * b) **Characters that I think need to be fixed:** Beyond adding characters, there are also major issues in how certain existing characters are depicted, including the ideologies they are assigned and the interest groups they belong to. Below is a list, along with my reasons for each:
      * **Bhagat Singh (FIXED to Communist in Civil Servants/Trade Unions, not Anarchist in Civil Servants):** This one is potentially controversial and depends on which phase of Singh’s life you focus on. I will be honest that this is partly based on opinion, and keeping him as an anarchist is not inherently incorrect if you focus on different writings and influences. Nevertheless, in much of Bhagat Singh’s short life he became more closely aligned with Lenin and Marx than with Bakunin. He did employ methods commonly associated with anarchist practice, and in the context of colonial India those methods did produce results. That said, he stated that he was a communist who wanted to push India toward a socialist state rather than dissolve the state, which would be the anarchist position. He quoted both Bakunin and Lenin, even if he seemed to favor Lenin in his commentary, so I can see the argument for either label. Still, I think this “either-or” quality makes him a better fit for communist in the game’s framework as it is more representative of the middle position between anarchist (representing his Bakuninist tendencies), and vanguardist (representing his Leninist tendencies). I also have reservations regarding making Singh part of the Civil Servants. He never served in it nor did he participate in the British government. Nevertheless, I can see an argument for it as he was part of the left intelligentsia so I cannot be too critical. I would say however that you could also make a case to include him in the Trade Union interest group by arguing that he created the ""Naujawan Bharat Sabha"" or the Young India Union. This however was more of a youth organization. Moreover, his early mentor did find the All-India Trade Union Congress (which was the largest trade union federation in India) and Singh did speak at it few times. Moreover, he was imprisoned and executed after throwing a bomb into the Central Legislative Assembly to protest against the Trade Disputes Bill of 1929 which was a repressive British law aimed to crush workers' rights, strike ability, and suppress political dissent
      * **Mohandas Gandhi (FIXED to Humanitarian in Bhadralok/Ryots, not Humanitarian in Civil Servants):** Unlike Jinnah, who served on the Viceroy’s Council, Gandhi was never in the British government or in the civil service. Moreover this mismatch highlighted by the fact that Gandhi was a Hindu petty-bourgeois figure more plausibly associated with the Bhadralok. That said, I think Ryots fits him even better, though Bhadralok would also be defensible. The key feature Gandhi brought into the Indian National Congress was mass participation, especially among villagers. The Non-Cooperation movement and his satyagrahas aimed to transform Congress from an elite club into a mass organization. Gandhi was, therefore, someone who mobilized the Indian masses by bringing the villages into the discourse surrounding national independence. Therefore, I believe the Ryot catgeory fits him better.
      * **Muhammad Ali Jinnah (FIXED to Sovereignist in Civil Servants, not Social Democrat in Civil Servants):** Jinnah being represented as a social democrat does not fit his politics at any point in his life. Early on, during his time in the Indian National Congress, he was aligned with the liberal Gokhale faction. He opposed the Tilakite faction and was mentored by figures such as Dadabhai Naoroji and Pherozeshah Mehta. He was even on friendly terms with Tilak despite their disagreements, and defended him, as his lawyer, against British charges of sedetion on multiple occasions. Like many liberals who departed earlier either to run as independents or to form the National Liberal Party of India, Jinnah opposed campaigns that required abandoning British institutions that provided Indians some level of representation. He left the INC when it embraced Gandhi's non-cooperation (which included non-participation in all institutions created by the colonial government). Later, during the partition era, he was still not strongly associated with universal suffrage as a primary cause. Even during the various British discussions/commissions/conferences to outline more responsible government in British India, Nehru’s main demand, in addition to complete independence, was universal suffrage, and Jinnah was either skeptical or largely quiet on universal suffrage (he remained vocal on independence; though he initially advocated for independence through dominion). That does not mean he opposed it outright, but it was not his central project. Instead, I think “Sovereignist” fits better, because at root he consistently championed independence from the Raj. The specific independent entity he argued for changed over time, from a united India to Pakistan, but the core struggle remained sovereignty. Here, I would like to add, even the local police force preference makes sense as Jinnah wanted to recruit the Zamindars from the National Unionist Party into the All-India Muslim League to push for Pakistan.
      * **Udham Singh (FIXED to Communist in Trade Unions, not Radical in Trade Unions):** Udham Singh is currently in the game, and while I think this is a great addition, I disagree with confining him to “Radical.” In the game, a “Radical” is someone opposed to “Factory Councils” and “Council Republic,” which does not align well with Udham Singh’s views. Udham Singh was an avowed Marxist and communist. He was a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, a member of the Ghadar Party, and a close associate of Bhagat Singh. Keeping him as merely “Radical” is, in my view, a misrepresentation of his politics.
2. **Map:** I love the map changes that were introduced by the Victoria 3 DLC. I even made a post about Lahore on this very subreddit, but I took it down after I saw another post about the release. Nevertheless, there are still major issues with the map that I think should be revised. I have broken this section down into two parts as well: a) **changes in state modifiers**, and b) **changes in state boundaries**.
   * **Changes in State Modifiers**: The map of India has some great state modifiers and, in general, they are well placed. However, there are a few modifiers that are absent, and a few that make little sense in their current form. In particular, there is an issue with the Natural Harbour modifiers in Carnatic, West Bengal, Northern Circars, and Bombay. To start with the first two, neither Carnatic nor West Bengal has a natural harbour in the real world. This is somewhat more defensible in West Bengal, because you could argue that the Hooghly functions as a kind of natural harbour, but there is no excuse for Carnatic, which never served as a natural harbour. In fact, it was historically a poor location for a harbour, and the British had to pour massive amounts of resources into making it viable (it was their first main harbour in the region, they had to). That said, I understand why this decision was made: both locations were among the main ports of British India. So I do not blame the developers, but I think a simple name change, similar to what happened with the London Docklands, would go a long way. This is especially true for Calcutta, which was treated as the second city of the empire. This is also my main criticism of Bombay. I would prefer the modifier to be something more specific, such as “Bombay Harbour,” with a larger bonus to reflect its prominence. The last issue in this category is Northern Circars. The best natural harbour in India is in the Northern Circars, at Visakhapatnam, and the British began building it up quickly due to the need for a deeper, broader natural harbour. Despite this, the natural harbour modifier is completely absent. I think it would be a great addition to include a unique harbour modifier here, such as “Dolphin Bay” or “Dolphin Harbour.” This harbour could also have a larger buff than the ordinary natural harbour modifier (mirroring perhaps the Bombay Harbour modifier).
   * **Changes in State Boundaries**: The India DLC introduced changes that the game badly needed, but there are still some borders I would like to tweak. Specifically, I would like to fix two boundaries: 1) East Bengal and West Bengal, and 2) Sindh and Gujarat. Starting with Bengal, the game appears to use the 1947 boundary between East and West Bengal. The problem is that this boundary was not decided until after the game’s end date of 1936. It was not a boundary that was formally noted or drawn within the game’s timeframe. This is not an argument for merging the states, but rather for readjusting the boundary. Unlike Punjab, where there was no earlier division and using the later partition boundary is more defensible (as its the only practical option available), Bengal had a major administrative division in 1905, the Curzon Partition of Bengal, which created a real and historically relevant administrative border. In the context of the game’s period, I think that boundary makes far more sense than the current one. Moving on to Sindh and Gujarat, Sindh’s borders are mostly fine, except for one province on the northern side of the Rann of Kutch (southern side of Sindh) that is assigned to Gujarat. I understand why the developers made this decision, since it aligns with modern boundaries, but it creates an awkward result in-game. The Rann of Kutch is a salt marsh and is represented in the game as part of the ocean, which visually splits the state and produces an ugly border. From a purely aesthetic standpoint, it might make more sense to assign that province to Sindh to avoid border gore, though I will admit this is mostly a preference.",https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1qft9ud/suggested_tweaks_to_india_in_victoria_3/
