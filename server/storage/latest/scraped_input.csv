To give you an overview, my parents hail from small villages, but thankfully educated. Many of my relatives (my parents‚Äô generation) live in rural areas and villages, but still don‚Äôt discriminate people or got discriminated(at least in my knowledge) and quite liberal in their views even though they weren‚Äôt well educated due to poverty. We even had inter-caste and inter-religion marriages in our family(with parents‚Äô approval), but never faced serious backlash. Majority of my family were accepting, some opposed but eventually accepted. Since my childhood, the topic of caste has always been a taboo in my home and school. Students or teachers never ask others of their caste or where they originally come from. I know some students formed friendships based on their caste during my higher secondary education, but it never posed a problem like discrimination or got violent in the name of caste because students knew very well they will get expelled from the school. Me or many of my friends never faced problems due to our caste/religion, at least in our experiences during School, college or in workplace. I know there are exceptions and people still ask others of their caste casually in my state too, but the numbers got reduced(hopefully).

It‚Äôs not just one community‚Äîboth Hindu and Muslim extremism seem to be on the rise, and it‚Äôs tearing us apart.Recently, I watched a video of Naseeruddin Shah, where he talked about how he doesn‚Äôt understand the obsession with what happens after death (like heaven or hell). He said something like, ‚ÄúWhy should I care about the afterlife? I want to live my current life as a good human.‚Äù I found it refreshing because he was focusing on being a compassionate person in the present, not getting lost in religious dogma. But when I scrolled through the comments, I was shocked. Not a single Muslim commenter seemed to agree with him. Instead, people were attacking him, saying things like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fake Muslim,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll go to Jahannam,‚Äù or ‚ÄúShame on you for disrespecting the Quran.‚Äù It felt like no one was even willing to consider his point about living in the now and caring for others.This isn‚Äôt just about Muslims, though. I‚Äôve seen similar extremism among Hindus toohate speech, mob violence, and this ‚Äúus vs. them‚Äù mentality. Whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù accusations, it‚Äôs the same intolerance. Both sides seem so caught up in defending their religion that they forget what it means to be human.Where is this extremist mindset coming from? India has always been diverse, with Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and others living together. But now, it feels like social media, politics, and even some religious leaders are fueling division. The BJP‚Äôs Hindu nationalist rhetoric and certain Muslim clerics‚Äô rigid teachings aren‚Äôt helping. It‚Äôs like everyone‚Äôs being pushed to pick a side instead of finding common ground.I‚Äôm not saying religion is bad, but why can‚Äôt we focus on shared values like kindness and respect? Naseeruddin Shah‚Äôs point about living as a good human resonates with me because it cuts through the noise. Yet, the hate he got shows how hard it is to have a rational conversation about religion in India today.What do you all think? Is this extremism getting worse? How do we move toward a more tolerant India where we can live in the present and care about each other, not just our religious identities? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, especially if you‚Äôve seen similar trends or have ideas on how to bridge this divide.",https://old.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1k8w3vf/the_rise_of_religious_extremism_in_india_why_cant/

Mob Attack on Christians in Odisha Sparks Outcry Amid Rising Religious Tensions in India,nan,1 point,0 comments,1 month ago,Worthy_News,u/Worthy_News,"Mob Attack on Christians in Odisha Sparks Outcry Amid Rising Religious Tensions in India\ \ by Worthy News Washington D.C. Bureau Staff\ \ (Worthy News) - More than 30 Christians were injured in a brutal mob attack during a peaceful prayer gathering in Odisha's Malkangiri district, with no arrests made nearly two weeks after the incident, according to multiple rights groups and local sources.\ \ The violence unfolded on June 21 in Kotamateru village, where around 20 Christian farming families had gathered to bless seeds ahead of the planting season. The prayer event turned chaotic when an estimated 400 individuals, reportedly armed with axes and sticks, stormed the gathering in a coordinated assault.\ \ According to Christian Solidarity International (CSI), at least 20 people sustained serious injuries and were hospitalized. A local pastor, alerted by one of the victims, contacted Malkangiri Police, who arrived at the scene to evacuate the wounded. Other community members fled to a nearby church, which is now serving as a makeshift relief center.\ \ The U.S.-based International Christian Concern (ICC) reported that the victims were attacked while eating lunch, and that the assault involved Christians from three nearby villages. Eyewitnesses claim that Hindu nationalist groups were behind the violence.\ \ However, Malkangiri police offered a different version of events. Inspector Rigan Kinda told The Telegraph that the clash began as a personal dispute between two brothers--one Christian and the other Hindu--that escalated over religious differences.\ \ Christian leaders have firmly rejected the police account, calling it a cover-up. They allege that the Bajrang Dal, a right-wing Hindu nationalist group, orchestrated the assault. Bajrang Dal's local leader denied direct involvement but admitted to growing ""spontaneous"" resistance to what he described as religious conversions by Christians.\ \ Tensions have reportedly risen since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a Hindu nationalist political party, gained power in Odisha's state government in June 2024. A local pastor told CSI he has received repeated threats and has stopped going to work due to fear for his safety. A video circulating on social media allegedly shows a Hindu leader warning Christians of consequences if they continue proselytizing.\ \ Christian organizations including Rashtriya Christian Morcha, Malkangiri District Christian Manch, and the Council of Evangelical Churches in India have visited the victims and demanded swift action from local authorities. Despite filing a formal complaint, police have not applied more serious charges such as attempted murder or religious hate crimes, sparking outrage among community leaders.\ \ On June 23, the Malkangiri Pastors Fellowship submitted a memorandum to the district police chief, urging the establishment of a permanent police outpost in Kotamateru and nearby areas. As of July 2, no arrests have been made, and no additional security measures have been implemented, according to CSI.\ \ Bishop Pallab Kumar Lima, who heads the Odisha chapter of the Rashtriya Christian Morcha, described the aftermath as ""a grave humanitarian crisis."" He has called for state-sponsored relief under the Odisha Victim Compensation Scheme.\ \ This incident is part of a larger pattern of rising violence against Christians in India. Between March and April 2025, fact-finding teams documented escalating anti-Christian attacks across several districts in Odisha, including Nabarangpur and Gajapati. One particularly disturbing case involved the exhumation of a young Christian man's body, with his family assaulted while police allegedly stood by.\ \ India witnessed one of its worst anti-Christian pogroms in 2007-2008 in the Kandhamal district, where over 100 churches were destroyed and thousands displaced.\ \ Meanwhile, a recent report by the United Christian Forum (UCF) indicates that, on average, two attacks on Christians occur daily in India. The UCF recorded 313 incidents from January to May 2025, involving physical assaults, social boycotts, destruction of religious property, and threats.\ \ Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh--both governed by the BJP--have emerged as major hotspots for such violence. UCF said 64 incidents were reported in Chhattisgarh and 58 in Uttar Pradesh. The organization noted that many cases go unreported due to fear of retribution in what it described as an environment of ""impunity and political patronage.""\ \ UCF's national convenor, A.C. Michael, accused elements within the law and justice systems of complicity. He warned that without urgent political and legal intervention, the identity and survival of India's Christian community could be at serious risk.\ \ India currently has anti-conversion laws in 12 states--many of them BJP-ruled--which Christian leaders argue have been weaponized to target minorities. The strictest such law is in Uttar Pradesh, with other states like Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh expected to adopt similar provisions.\ \ As the Kotamateru victims await justice, Christian leaders continue to press the government for protection and accountability, warning that the cycle of violence will only worsen without decisive action. \ \",https://old.reddit.com/user/Worthy_News/comments/1lpwaev/mob_attack_on_christians_in_odisha_sparks_outcry/

However, the recent events have made me question whether it is us as a community that has failed. I have seen numerous posts in this sub, criticizing us and sharing communal hatred and I understand where you are coming from. But please keep in mind, we are equally disturbed by the occurrence of events in Murshidabad and other places. I firmly believe, these are not caused by the general Muslim population, but by miscreants within the community who are backed by the ruling party, to distract attention from the SSC case.
I highly condemn the acts of these people and I believe if there is any fault in the act, the way to draw attention to it is via peaceful protests, not vandalism. Unfortunately, due to the work of these particular sections of our community, we all are facing hate. I have seen people questioning our allegiance to our nation and i believe nothing can be more disrespectful than that. None of the political parties in India are providing any solution and stop these protests, instead they are busy spreading communal violence and instigating raids.
I am quite a younger person in this sub, my parents are both professors and we love our nation and know how ""peaceful protests"" look like. yes, we exist. but due to a particular section of people, please don't blame us as a whole community, there are always a few rotten eggs in a basket. All of my family, friends and acquaintances who are Muslim, condemn this act and haven't ever participated in these riots, but does that make us at fault too?
I hope, WB police arrests these hooligans and lock them up for good. And I'm absolutely sick of this corrupt government, but what makes me sadder is even if we have the largest democracy in the world, we don't have enough choices, cause the other choices are no different than the one we have now.

Did our people back then ever accept the ghulami of mughals? Like all I see is them saying how Indians are forgetting the countless times sikhs have been covered in the national flag while protecting india at the border. Like seriously it is so annoying that they have forgotten we are a sovereign panth. They think our sole duty of existence is to go die at the borders of india. It's so annoying how they try to prove something to these people we have nothing to do with. We dont have to prove anything to these people. It‚Äôs very interesting that when Sikhs follow their religion they are labelled terrorists. I even saw a petition to ban kirpans. Sikhs from India are born there. They have no choice but to be there. Their thinking is not reciprocal towards any ideas or facts that would suggest that they are not equal participants in the country they are stuck in. Its the reason why Sikhs born in western countries are passionate about human rights for the victims of 1984 but Sikhs in India say ""so sad too bad"".The most simplest is that Sikhs in India genuinely don't give a shit. They don't care that they live in a country that attacked Harmandir Sahib, killed pilgrims, massacred Amaritdhari Sikhs for 3 months, then raped and murdered Sikhs in Delhi, then raped and murdered Sikhs in Punjab for 10 years. They are ok wtih all of this. So long as they didn't suffer and their ""Indianness"" wasn't taken away from them. Its the reason why the mainstream Punjabi media is throwing Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sadana under the bus for January 26, 2021. Make the issue about why a handful of protestors don't represent farmer protest rather than challenging the authority of a country that links pizzas to Khalistan. Sikhs are modern day Rajputs who gallantly rode along Mughals while other Rajput kingdoms were being oppressed. I think Sikhs as a people should be skeptical of any nation state we reside in. Especially one as rife with corruption as India, especially with the rising tide of nationalism and Anti-Sikh and wide spread of Sikhophobia there.

But what led to that was rising insurgency in Punjab by Pro Khalistan elements which were backed and trained by foreign organizations like ISI, Special services group from Pakistan and even CIA. There was an insurgency in Punjab. According to uman Rights Watch in the beginning on the 1980s, Sikh separatists in Punjab attacked non-Sikhs in the state. In October 1983, On the same day, in another location a group of militants killed two officials during an attack on a train.174 Trains were attacked and people were shot after being pulled from buses. This led to inhabitable conditions of Hindus in Punjab and many Hindus were forced to leave Punjab leaving everything behind to save themselves. Most of the Hindu families in Punjab during this era had to change their last name (from Sharma to Kumar/Rani) including my parents to protect themselves. Operation Blue Star was done because of such militants taking shelter inside the Golden Temple to remove militant religious leader Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers. This followed the unfortunate Delhi Sikh riots, and conditions worsened for Hindus in Punjab at the same time leading to unfortunate sequence of events.",https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jlgodr/we_need_to_know_about_the_other_side_of_story/

She Was Just a Child: The Hidden Horror of a 13 year old Lower Caste Dalit Girl‚Äôs Ordeal in India,nan,479 points,23 comments,2 months ago,APJONLY1,r/atheism,"This girl isn‚Äôt a headline. She isn‚Äôt a statistic. She is a child whose innocence was stolen in the most horrific way imaginable ‚Äî raped repeatedly by 14 men over two years aged between 15 to 54 belonging to influential community. She is also a Dalit. To those unfamiliar with India‚Äôs caste system, ‚ÄúDalit‚Äù refers to the lowest rung in a centuries-old social hierarchy, historically branded as ‚Äúuntouchables.‚Äù In a civilized society, it should have led to an uproar and what not. But in India, there will be selective uproar when anything bad happens to women of higher caste. If it happens to women from lower caste, its an inconvenience to those in power who will silence the victims. Despite legal protections, Dalits continue to face systemic discrimination, exclusion, and violence. For Dalit women and girls, this oppression is multiplied by gender. It means being poor, invisible, and often unheard ‚Äî even when they scream. This is Andhra Pradesh, India. 13 year old Dalit girl raped for two years by 14 men belonging to influential community who are aged between 14 to 54. Her ordeal started as perpetrators took a photo of her sitting with a classmate and then they blackmailed her. At present, she is pregnant, admitted at a govt hospital and looking at an uncertain future. In a quiet hospital ward in southern India, now 15 year old girl lies on a bed, eight months pregnant. Her body is bruised by time and trauma. Her eyes ‚Äî if you looked into them ‚Äî would tell you stories too painful for words. A Hidden Crime Her abuse began when she was just 13. A classmate, from a higher caste, secretly took photos of her. With threats and manipulation, he and another boy coerced her into submission, raped her, filmed the act ‚Äî and handed her over to others like she was property. Over two years, 14 men used her, violated her, broke her. These were not just strangers. They were men from her village. Some were neighbors. And nearly all of them belonged to a dominant caste. In villages like hers, caste is power. And power, in the wrong hands, becomes impunity. Nobody Came Her school noticed she had stopped attending. But no one asked why. No teacher raised a concern. The health workers assigned to her village didn‚Äôt report a thing. Volunteers from women‚Äôs welfare groups said nothing. She had dropped off the radar, and nobody cared to look for her. When she became pregnant, her mother, struggling alone after the death of her husband, finally realized the horror her daughter had endured. She took her to the police. It was only then that the arrests began,17 people in total, including three minors. A Community That Chose Silence What followed was worse. Members of the dominant caste, the very community from which her abusers came, allegedly pressured her mother to stay silent.

On a Sunday afternoon in Kharigumma village, two Dalit men, Bulu Nayak (52) and Babul Nayak (43), were subjected to unimaginable cruelty. Falsely accused of cattle smuggling, they were beaten, half-shaved, tied up, forced to crawl for two kilometers, and made to eat grass and drink sewage water. This was not an isolated act of mob violence ‚Äî it was a stark reminder of the systemic caste oppression that continues to plague India, even in 2025 This incident is not just a crime; it is a mirror reflecting the ugly reality of caste discrimination in modern India. The perpetrators acted with impunity, emboldened by a society where Dalits ‚Äî historically marginalized and dehumanized ‚Äî are still seen as less than equal. The victims‚Äô injuries, both physical and emotional, tell a story of a nation that has failed to live up to its constitutional promise of equality. A Village‚Äôs Cruelty: Caste in Rural India In villages like Kharigumma, caste is not just a social hierarchy ‚Äî it is a lived reality that dictates every aspect of life. Dalits, historically relegated to the margins, are often denied access to common resources, barred from temples, and treated as less than human. Bulu and Babul‚Äôs ordeal began with a simple act: purchasing cattle for a wedding, a tradition meant to bring joy. Instead, it became a nightmare. The mob that intercepted them didn‚Äôt see two men with hopes and families ‚Äî they saw ‚ÄúDalits,‚Äù a label that, in their minds, justified violence. The attackers‚Äô actions were calculated to degrade. Tying the men‚Äôs limbs, shaving their heads, forcing them to crawl ‚Äî these were not random acts but rituals of caste oppression, designed to remind Dalits of their ‚Äúplace.‚Äù The demand for Rs 30,000 to release the cattle was not just extortion; it was a power play, a way to assert dominance over those deemed inferior. As the men crawled, bloodied and broken, under the gaze of bystanders, the silence of the crowd spoke volumes. In villages across India, such silence often enables caste violence, allowing perpetrators to act with impunity. The aftermath was equally heartbreaking. The police, preoccupied with other duties, delayed registering the complaint until late that night. Bulu and Babul, battered and humiliated, had to fight for their voices to be heard. Even as they sought medical treatment, their cattle remained in the hands of their tormentors. This is the reality of caste in rural India: a system where justice is a distant dream, and dignity is a privilege reserved for the ‚Äúupper‚Äù castes.

This was not an isolated act of mob violence ‚Äî it was a stark reminder of the systemic caste oppression that continues to plague India, even in 2025 This incident is not just a crime; it is a mirror reflecting the ugly reality of caste discrimination in modern India. The perpetrators acted with impunity, emboldened by a society where Dalits ‚Äî historically marginalized and dehumanized ‚Äî are still seen as less than equal. The victims‚Äô injuries, both physical and emotional, tell a story of a nation that has failed to live up to its constitutional promise of equality. A Village‚Äôs Cruelty: Caste in Rural India In villages like Kharigumma, caste is not just a social hierarchy ‚Äî it is a lived reality that dictates every aspect of life. Dalits, historically relegated to the margins, are often denied access to common resources, barred from temples, and treated as less than human. Bulu and Babul‚Äôs ordeal began with a simple act: purchasing cattle for a wedding, a tradition meant to bring joy. Instead, it became a nightmare. The mob that intercepted them didn‚Äôt see two men with hopes and families ‚Äî they saw ‚ÄúDalits,‚Äù a label that, in their minds, justified violence. The attackers‚Äô actions were calculated to degrade. Tying the men‚Äôs limbs, shaving their heads, forcing them to crawl ‚Äî these were not random acts but rituals of caste oppression, designed to remind Dalits of their ‚Äúplace.‚Äù The demand for Rs 30,000 to release the cattle was not just extortion; it was a power play, a way to assert dominance over those deemed inferior. As the men crawled, bloodied and broken, under the gaze of bystanders, the silence of the crowd spoke volumes. In villages across India, such silence often enables caste violence, allowing perpetrators to act with impunity. The aftermath was equally heartbreaking. The police, preoccupied with other duties, delayed registering the complaint until late that night. Bulu and Babul, battered and humiliated, had to fight for their voices to be heard. Even as they sought medical treatment, their cattle remained in the hands of their tormentors. This is the reality of caste in rural India: a system where justice is a distant dream, and dignity is a privilege reserved for the ‚Äúupper‚Äù castes.

She Was Just a Child: The Hidden Horror of a 13 year old Lower Caste Dalit Girl‚Äôs Ordeal in India,nan,2 points,0 comments,2 months ago,APJONLY1,r/MediumAuthors,"This girl isn‚Äôt a headline. She isn‚Äôt a statistic. She is a child whose innocence was stolen in the most horrific way imaginable ‚Äî raped repeatedly by 14 men over two years aged between 15 to 54. She is also a Dalit. To those unfamiliar with India‚Äôs caste system, ‚ÄúDalit‚Äù refers to the lowest rung in a centuries-old social hierarchy, historically branded as ‚Äúuntouchables.‚Äù Despite legal protections, Dalits continue to face systemic discrimination, exclusion, and violence. For Dalit women and girls, this oppression is multiplied by gender. It means being poor, invisible, and often unheard ‚Äî even when they scream. This is Andhra Pradesh, India. 13 year old Dalit girl raped for two years by 14 men belonging to influential community who are aged between 14 to 53. Her ordeal started as perpetrators took a photo of her sitting with a classmate and then they blackmailed her. At present, she is pregnant, admitted at a govt hospital and looking at an uncertain future. In a civilized society, it should have led to an uproar and what not. But in India, there will be selective uproar when anything bad happens to women of higher caste. If it happens to women from lower caste, its an inconvenience to those in power who will silence the victims. In a quiet hospital ward in southern India, now 15 year old girl lies on a bed, eight months pregnant. Her body is bruised by time and trauma. Her eyes ‚Äî if you looked into them ‚Äî would tell you stories too painful for words. A Hidden Crime Her abuse began when she was just 13. A classmate, from a higher caste, secretly took photos of her. With threats and manipulation, he and another boy coerced her into submission, raped her, filmed the act ‚Äî and handed her over to others like she was property. Over two years, 14 men used her, violated her, broke her. These were not just strangers. They were men from her village. Some were neighbors. And nearly all of them belonged to a dominant caste. In villages like hers, caste is power. And power, in the wrong hands, becomes impunity. Nobody Came Her school noticed she had stopped attending. But no one asked why. No teacher raised a concern. The health workers assigned to her village didn‚Äôt report a thing. Volunteers from women‚Äôs welfare groups said nothing. She had dropped off the radar, and nobody cared to look for her. When she became pregnant, her mother, struggling alone after the death of her husband, finally realized the horror her daughter had endured. She took her to the police. It was only then that the arrests began,17 people in total, including three minors. A Community That Chose Silence What followed was worse. Members of the dominant caste, the very community from which her abusers came, allegedly pressured her mother to stay silent.

Now the Brazilian president, Bolsonaro, is endorsing groups that deforest, and states that the deforestation the EU talks about, is exaggerated and ""fake news"". If freezing part of the money that is supposed to encourage the preservation of the Amazon doesn't work, wouldn't boycotting the producers that benefit from deforestation be the solution instead? Many countries and groups of people vehemently boycott some Israeli products, and while the Israel/Palestine question may be a matter of what your politics are, the Amazon isn't, just about everyone agrees, it's important to the whole world that we preserve it. Incredibly rich corporations and agribusiness players are getting rich destroying one of the most important ecosystems in the world because we pay them to. Shouldn't we boycott them?

Everyone this message can save your life! Pay attention,Health/Environment,694 points,150 comments,1 year ago,Ayushman_Virus,r/india,"Everyone ! Especially Indians, pay attention. According to recent studies on Spices of MDH, Everest and baby food items of Nestle, it has been found that they are ""Fatal"" for long term use. First let's talk about spices of MDH and Everest. In spices of these company, a group 1 carcinogen, that is ethenyl oxide has been found. For those who don't know what carcinogens are, these are basically cancer causing substances and group 1 carcinogen means it is 100% verified that they cause cancer. These companies claim that they use only a Lil bit ammount of this and it will not cause any casualties but the truth however is it cause cancer in long term. Now let's talk about Nestle. In baby products like cerelac and Vido, it has been found that this company adds a lot of added suger in India, 2.2gm. which is NOT healthy for kids. Due to this, obesity rates have been increased in last few years. Obesity is root of all the deceases and you know what more dangerous? Type 2 diabetes...... Among kids below 5 YEARS OF AGE. This is the perfect definition of horror. This obesity can also cause cancer or lead to heart attack. But these are baby products so why we need to be scared, we are not babies anymore? Well we should be scared because I am only talking about the tests done with food products popular among Indians. There are many food products whose tests are ongoing and they are also misleading us. But it is only in India, right? No, in other foreign countries, it is worse. So, I recommend you guys that avoid packaged food items and try to consume whole food items like homemade food, fru. You can even make these packaged food items at home and also learn something new and can also stay healthy! Now, let's enlighten everyone about this. Let's start a trend called #boycottPackagedFoodItems This was my message to everyone Regards Ayushman Meghdoot Mahapatra Samal",https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1cf9w4p/everyone_this_message_can_save_your_life_pay/

These same so-called movie reviewers made videos on the same topic when the trailer of Brahmastra was released and people were criticizing that one scene that you already know. If people have the choice of what to watch or what not, then it's our choice, who are they to speak to. That's what Kareena Kapoor Khan said in an interview with Barkha Dutt. These guys have problems when we boycott and criticize Bollywood for constantly making remakes, and spreading propaganda against Sanatana Dharma. These so-called celebrities don't stop these things and give us gyaan on our Hindu festivals like Diwali, Holi, Navratri, Makar Sankranti, etc. These so-called celebrities don't like Hindi as a language to speak because it is down market for them. These so-called celebrities say that India is not safe for them and their children. These so-called celebrities support anti-India sentiments, terrorism, Naxalism, the Free Kashmir movement, etc. These so-called celebrities blame our Hindu festivals for being patriarchal and conservative and keep their mouth shut about other religions. These so-called celebrities have their secret relations with Dawood and other Underworld gangsters, so why not boycott them? Why we should spend a single penny on Bollywood? At last, India is a free democracy, if we can choose our leaders through election by our choice then, we can only decide which Bollywood movie to make blockbuster or not.

But we are told that we have no enemy at all in this world. Then, why this army is maintained, I do not quite know. Secondly, the only possible enemy, if one may use that world, is probably Pakistan. And that too, on account of Kashmir. Now, with regard to Kashmir, I hope that this House will have a full opportunity of discussing that question. I did not have time to say anything, nor did I think it right to spend just a few moments on a problem so great as that of Kashmir. But surely the matter is within the charge of the U.N.O., and I do not think that Pakistan would be so foolish as to invade Kashmir or to invade this country in the teeth of the U.N.O. decision on the subject.

Trump is secretly a scaly and one day while he was wearing his snake suit he tricked Eve and told her to eat the apple. He also killed Abel. He also lead the Mongol invasions of everywhere. And the Hun invasions. And the Mughal invasions of India. And the Viking invasions.Trump was the guy who started colonialism(only the invading part not the part where they provided technology and medicine to the natives). After Trump tested positive for Covid19, he spit on Native Americans, nearly driving them extinct. Trump also killed all the dinosaurs. He was also behind the Bronze age collapse. Trump single-handedly did the Triangular Slave Trade; hell he was the guy Trump bought the slaves from. Trump also beheaded a French teacher for disrespecting Mohammad, and blamed it on wholesome Muslimerinos. All the blood diamonds are produced by Trump. He was the guy who cut Congolese workers hands off because they did not meet his supply. Trump chased Kyyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha with a skateboard and beat him up and snatched his rifle, and used it to kill Jacob Blake. During the BLM protests Trump was the one who looted and burned all the stores. Even during the Charolletsville incident, they were all shadow-clones of Trump. Trump did Pearl Harbor and bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Trump was the mastermind of the Holodomor, the Great Leap Forward, East Germany and every time a tankie screams ""It was not real communism"", Trump was involved. Trump grilled the last dodo. Trump shoots Palestinian kids for fun and shoots missiles at Israeli civilians. He was the guy who killed all those Rohingyas, and Uyghurs. He was also involved the current Hong Kong situation; so much involved that he was the one who sold opium to the Chinese. The Irish potato famine, Africa, the Bengal Famine; all because of Trump. Trump commits human rights violations on North Korean citizens everyday. Al Qaeda, Mujaheddin, Boko-Haram, Taliban; TRUMP. He also killed the prophet of the wholesome 100 Muslimerinos, Sulemani; in a missile strike. He also did the Rape of Nanjing and it was Trump who ordered and supplied all the Korean comfort women. Trump personally snitched on Anne Frank to Trump. The Jim Crow laws were passed by Trump, as well as the war on drugs. The partition of India was Trump's fault, as well as the resulting Kashmir issue. He also starred in the Cuban missile crisis and started the cold war. During the Russian Revolution, the peasants understood that Nikolai II's family was innocent, and would offer them a chance to leave, but Trump massacred them. Trump tried his best but failed in preventing the American and French Revolutions, but he got back at them by causing the Reign of Terror. Trump tortured Louis XVI's son and forced him into saying that he had sex with his mother and aunt, and promptly guillotined them. Trump invented pineapple-pizza and Tofu-Chicken. He was the guy who snitched on Alan Turing, revealing that he was gay. The judge felt that such a respected professor could be sent away with a slap on the wrist, but Trump rigged the jury and sentenced him to hormonal therapy. Trump rigged the New York Stock Exchange and caused the great depression. In the town of Waco, he raped a woman, blamed it on a black man and lynched him by burning him alive. He was the leader of the Khmer Rouge and wrote the plot for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Despite making up only 3.0211238398812703164724804575659e-7 % of the population Donald Trump commits 100% of the crimes. Trump also was the dictator of Uganda. Trump regularly kills journalists and opposition leaders in Russia. He was behind Princess Diana's car crash. Trump fucked a monkey and started the AIDS pandemic. He started coronavirus and ebola and the Black Death and the Spanish flu and the Bubonic plague and the syphillis outbreak and the Trojan war and tthe Bush war and the fall of Rome and the Dark Ages. After taking a dump, Trump leaves his toilet paper like . Trump burned down the Notre Dame, and knelled on George Floyds neck. He also was the guy who sold drugs to George Floyd. Trump is the reason I am the only person in my class who doesn't have a girlfriend. Trump is the reason why the Armenia Azerbaijan crisis is even there.",https://old.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/jmnrn0/hitler_was_worse_than_trump/

The last census taken was in 2011 with Sikhs barely at a majority and now a decade later we see most major cities in the state being majority Hindu alongside the rest of the state itself at this point meanwhile our supposed Punjabi Hindu ""brothers"" still cry and moan about being a minority in danger under evil khalistani anti nationals. Much of this has to do with the government sponsored drug trade, occasional killings and arrests of sikhs, relocation of the few heavy industries in Punjab to elsewhere which forces the educated to also move out due to the lack of job opportunities besides labour, which few educated people who instead could instead find higher and better paying jobs for their skill. Now in order to fill up the lack of labour we see the importing of hundreds of thousands of gangetic thugs from Bihar and UP as well as the rest of the cow belt in order to fill up employment demands. Fertility rate of Sikhs are at an all-time low and in fact, the lowest in the country, and all the pollution, pesticides, and chemicals that have poisoned the once fertile, clean, and healthy crops and atmosphere in the aftermath of the green revolution as well as the now drying up rivers (which are already being diverted) just seems to make that even worse. The comedian we have in Punjab as CM who mocked ""Raj Karega Khalsa"" is obviously a chamcha of the central government so there's no point of trying to appeal to the government over and over again, regardless of how much the Indians want to tell us about how we are free because we have Sikh members in the administration, yada yada.

They are always disrespected in the country and no one even cares to listen to their opinions. Just because opposition criticizes the government, the whole Indian population suddenly assumes that they are anti national who have foreign funding. I mean when did critcising the government became an anti national move, its an incentive for parties to do better instead of hiding their failures and doing whataboutism on everything. Moreover, India has a clown and incompetent opposition who don't criticise the government on right issues and suggest solutions. Its not the mistake of people if they think that India doesn't have any problems because opposition is not highlighting the right issues hence the people are bound to believe that India doesn't have any major issues and the government is perfect and doesn't have any bad elements.

AITA for refusing to try on hijab?,Advice Needed,"12,876 points","5,416 comments",6 months ago,Historical_Common297,r/AITAH,"I (26 F) am aware that this is an incredibly controversial topic but I am at my wits end in this situation and my family and friends are overseas and mostly incapable of helping me due to inexperience and lack of awareness. I am in the UK for my PhD and my roommate (28F) is muslim. We usually get along very well and I have been respectful and accommodating of her religious practices. I am very aware of the rising islamophobia worldwide and try to advocate against it whenever I can. I feel the need to mention these things because they become relevant. I am an atheist myself. My roommate on numerous occasions has tried to discuss religion and theology with me, but I have quickly shut her down fearing that this may lead to a conflict due to our differences. After her several attempts of comparing our respective religious backgrounds, I firmly told her that religion is that one topic I don‚Äôt want to remotely touch in a conversation with her because I did not want an argumentative and tense relationship with someone I share a roof with and she understood and stopped. Everything was fine for months until she started following those drives on tiktok where people get a hijab makeover on the streets and look pretty and thought of doing such a drive of her own. I gave her a thumbs up and moved on until she said she wanted to practice on me. I told her that I am not comfortable with this. She told me it is just a piece of cloth and it won‚Äôt hurt to try because I may end up liking it. I firmly told her that while that is absolutely alright, I don‚Äôt want to try it on, because I am simply not interested. This went on back and forth for some time until she told me that she is glad my islamophobia is finally out in the open and I have exposed myself. I was shocked and I asked her what made her think that I am an Islamophobe based on this one incident when I have gone above and beyond for her comfort. I abide by all her dietary restrictions in our shared kitchen despite not having any such restriction of my own. Once I bought this beautiful statue of a Hindu Goddess (not for worshipping purposes but purely for aesthetic reasons) and she told me that she was uncomfortable with the violent figure. I immediately complied and packed it away without any argument. I profusely apologised to her and I told her that I have nothing against hijab just because I don‚Äôt want it on me. She stopped talking to me altogether after that. A couple of other people on the campus have reported that she is telling everyone how uncomfortable she is sharing a place with someone so hateful towards her religion. While I am hurt that I have lost a friend overnight, I am also extremely scared that the word may reach the university administration and they might take disciplinary action against me. I may lose my scholarship or maybe thrown out of college altogether. I am an international student and this would mean my career will be completely over. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to explain my end of the story because no one seems interested. I have continuously and unconditionally apologised to her since the event but nothing seems to work.

A 2 to 5 outdoor play in a country like India is brutal,Discussion,797 points,195 comments,3 years ago,ShaunBhowmick24,r/TheSilphRoad,"I went out yesterday to play the Community Day as incense is not boosted anymore & it was brutal. In a tropical country like India the afternoons are extremely hot & humid. I really couldn't continue after a couple of hours as I started feeling super exhausted even after drinking a lot of water & walking in shade mostly. It started feeling like no game/no Pok√©mon is worth this much of trouble. I couldn't just go out & be at one place (a caf√©/restaurant/mall) to play because the incense spawns stopped being boosted the moment i stopped. I think the boosted incense was a blessing, because it helped me & I'm sure a lot of people to stay at home & play in extreme hot or cold weather. It really felt like I was being forced to go out & play at a certain time frame. Not to mention the amount of stress it created for me to plan the day around that specific 3 hour window. This is all just too much hassle & I'm honestly just not going to care to go out on community days anymore. If Niantic thinks nerfing incense & reducing CD hours would encourage outdoor play & community activities, they're completely wrong in my opinion. They're just punishing people for being passionate about the game. People should just be free to choose how they play the game & that's when it becomes fun & not a stressful experience.",https://old.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/u10qwl/a_2_to_5_outdoor_play_in_a_country_like_india_is/

Since then, there has been some follow-up discussion on the sub itself and a lot of concerned criticism in modmail. Firstly, I would like to give a big thank you to everybody who did reach out to us; your input was really important and I've drawn on it heavily for this write up. I am keeping usernames anonymous by default, but if you ask I will edit this post to give you credit.",https://old.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/mc7qrt/menlib_retrospective_anyone_else_really_tired_of/
