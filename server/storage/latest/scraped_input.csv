This is going to be an opinionated history of India/Bharat. Basically Indian history has been so much clouded by single lens; vedic lense that people have forgotten what actually India/Bharat is, what  it means. and where it should go. Let's look at other meanings of Bharat meant, **which spread light continuously** or **which bears the weight**. Not someone's child or some king name. Those were very later interpretations by vedic schools to connect dots with their mythologies to give consistent history of India in vedic ways or puranic ways. In this article, I will try to make you ponder other ways of looking at India.

# Ancient India (After IVC Decline - Before 600 BCE)

Most people will feel uncomfortable or even insecure that why not vedic India? Are you trying to take away our identity? It is injustice. But honestly, calling ancient India a vedic country, is a much bigger injustice. Ancient India had already flourished with lots of philosophical schools even before vedic philosophies. In this time, there was a magadh area which was more of a shramanic land and northern India was of vedic lands. Although Vedic rituals were elitist, but still northern India had more of it, it was more influential there. 

geographically and culturally, early India was divided:

* The **northwestern and Gangetic plains** had stronger Vedic ritual presence, particularly among elites. Vedic rituals were elitist. After/During the fall of shramanic movements and during bhaktikal, these philosophies absorbed many elements from shramanic philosophies to become what is known to be Hinduism. 
* **Magadha and eastern India** were predominantly Shramanic, skeptical of ritual sacrifice, open to renunciation, debate, and ethical inquiry.
* Southern India was largely **indigenous and non-Vedic**, shaped by Dravidian cultures, local deities, and ethical–poetic traditions rather than ritual sacrifice or priestly authority.
* It later absorbed **Shramanic ideas and selective Brahmanical elements**, producing a flexible synthesis (Jain/Buddhist influence and Bhakti) 

# The Shramanic Movement ( 600 BCE to 600 CE) and True Golden Age of India

What is known to be the shramanic movement which can also be seen as the fruitful result of janapadas uniting into mahajanpadas, giving stable environments for philosophical and theological developments. It gave birth to philosophies like Buddhism, Jainism, Ajivikas and their associated schools. 

This period coincided with:

* The **Second Urbanization** of India
* The consolidation of **Janapadas into Mahajanapadas**
* The rise of large, stable polities capable of supporting universities, libraries, hospitals, and debate traditions

The Shramanic worldview transformed Indian civilization in several decisive ways:

* **Universalism**: Membership was not determined by birth or ritual purity.
* **Social Mobility**: Ethical conduct and knowledge, not caste, determined status.
* **Scientific Temper**: Emphasis on logic (*hetuvidya*), debate, empiricism, and inquiry.
* **Cosmopolitanism**: Indian ideas flowed to Central Asia, China, Southeast Asia, and beyond.

The results of these movements in terms of institutions were **Taxila, Nalanda, Vikramashila**, and **Odantapuri**. These were not merely religious centers but were more than that. They were multi-disciplinary universities. Gupta period, often remembered selectively for “Hindu revival,” was in fact deeply Shramanic in its intellectual orientation.

This was India’s real Golden Age.

# Early Medieval India (550–1200 CE): The Shramanic Void and Civilizational Decline

The fall of the Gupta Empire around 550 CE marked a turning point in Indian history, if we look from hindsight. It was not immediate collapse but slow internal decay of golden civilization into ritualistic, caste ridden society, losing memories of its own past. It can be termed as the dark ages of India, if we try to put parallels with European history. 

# The Core Thesis behind this point

India’s civilization decline started to began centuries before the invasions of 1001 CE. Military defeats was the final blow to a structure that was already hollowed out by intellectual stagnation, social rigidity and strategic blindness. 

The collapse of Buddhism and Jainism as mass institutions created a **Shramanic void**, one that the emergence of Brahmanical-Puranic order failed to fill.

# Intellectual Regression: From Logic to Ritual

The decline of Shramanic traditions also marked a shift in intellectual priorities.

* **Then**: Logic, debate, epistemology, medicine, astronomy
* **Now**: Ritual correctness, textual authority, hereditary knowledge

Philosophical dominance shifted toward Mimamsa concerned with ritual performance rather than ethics or inquiry. Although some schools of vedic philosophies were leading in logic, they all suffered from putting vedas as absolute authority. 

By the 11th century, the Persian scholar **Al-Biruni** observed that Indian elites had become insular, arrogant, and intellectually stagnant believing no knowledge existed beyond their own traditions. He explicitly blamed the priestly class for hoarding learning and misleading the masses with superstition.

# Ossification of Caste and Fragmented Identity

Shramanic traditions had provided the only large-scale counterweight to caste hierarchy. Their collapse led to:

* Hardening of **jati identities**
* Fragmentation into clan-based politics (Rajputization)
* Shrinking pools of administrators and soldiers
* Disarmed, alienated masses with no stake in civilizational defense

India lost not just unity in such a way, which still bothers present day India.

Strategic Blindness (Absence of *Shatrubodh*)

While the Arab world eagerly translated Greek, Roman, Persian, and Sanskrit texts to build a new scientific-military synthesis, India turned inward.

The curiosity of Nalanda was replaced by ritual self-satisfaction. New war technologies, political ideologies, and theological movements were dismissed as irrelevant *mleccha* concerns, until they arrived at the gates.

# Mythologization and the Loss of History

As institutions collapsed, history was replaced with mythology. Complex civilizational processes were reduced to divine cycles and moral allegories. This made introspection impossible and reform heretical. 

India did not remember its past, it sanctified it.

# Encounter with Islam: A Civilizational Asymmetry (1000–1700 CE)

The arrival of Islam in India must be understood not merely as invasion, but as a civilizational encounter marked by deep asymmetry. Islam arrived with a coherent and surprisingly new worldview-universalist theology, codified law, urban institutions, and a strong tradition of learning that eagerly absorbed Greek, Persian, and Indian knowledge. India, by contrast, encountered this force in a post-Shramanic phase-politically fragmented, intellectually inward, and socially rigid. Early conversions in frontier regions such as Gandhara and Bengal were not simply the result of coercion, but of civilizational appeal. Islam offered dignity, community, and mobility to populations excluded by caste-bound society. This was not the triumph of Islam alone, but the failure of a civilization that had lost its inclusive and ethical core. 

# a. The Northwest (Gandhara)

Gandhara was historically a Shramanic and cosmopolitan frontier along with many other major mainland India urbanized places, Gandhara was the key linking India to Central Asia. When Buddhist monasteries declined, due to Hunnic invasions and internal decay, the Brahmanical order did not replace them with an equally inclusive, universalizing framework.

Rigid purity laws and exclusionary practices labeled frontier populations as *mleccha*. These groups were never reintegrated. When Islam arrived, offering equality, community, and coherence, the region converted not merely by force, but by civilizational appeal.

# b. Eastern Bengal

A similar process unfolded in Bengal. Under the Buddhist Palas, the region thrived. After their fall, the conservative Sena dynasty retreated from frontier engagement.

As historian Richard Eaton notes, Islam spread in Bengal through agrarian expansion. Sufis cleared forests, issued land grants, and absorbed tribal populations. The Brahmanical order, constrained by caste notions of impurity, failed to do so.

This was not a loss to Islam; it was a failure of post-Shramanic Indian civilization.

# Colonization and Colonial Rediscovery and the “Mini-Renaissance” (19th-20th Century)

British colonization was not the beginning of India’s decline, but its most systematic exploitation. The British did not conquer a unified or intellectually vibrant civilization; they took control of a society already fragmented, institutionally weakened, and stripped of its universal ethical core. This made long-term foreign rule not only possible, but efficient.

Colonial governance was rational, bureaucratic, and extractive. Railways, courts, and revenue systems were built not to regenerate Indian society, but to administer and drain it. Education was introduced selectively to produce clerks, not thinkers; intermediaries, not citizens.

British scholarship rediscovered India’s past, but only as a relic. Living traditions were classified, frozen, and compartmentalized. Caste hardened further under colonial enumeration; religion became identity rather than inquiry. India learned to see itself through colonial categories ancient, mystical, and static.

Colonial rule did not destroy India’s civilization; it **completed its disempowerment**. By the time independence arrived, India inherited institutions of governance, but not institutions of thought.

The 19th-20th century is often called India’s renaissance. In truth, it was a **mini-renaissance**, limited to urban elites. Scientific rationality, constitutionalism, and social reform did not fully penetrate the masses. Also the main focus remained, connecting present day India, to vedic and puranic history. Some social reformers tried to put new looks on the past, but it was all being seen from tinted glass. 

Independence inherited symbols, not civilizational clarity.

# Present Discontent and Civilizational Restlessness

Modern India always seems restless, not because it's poor or defeated or incapable. But because it senses a profound loss, it cannot name. There is an uneasiness that runs beneath economic growth and cultural spectacle. Something essential is missing. That something is nothing but, Its true identity, the civilizational direction. 

On one side lies, the blind revivalism, a very desperate attempt to rebirth a mythologized past, a history flattened into scriptures, complexity in slogans. Instead of fact, symbols are worshipped in place of understanding. This past is not studied,questioned or even  remembered, but sanctified. And it shows the hollowness of the approach, when it distills into society as misleading confidence in myths etc, not what India truly stands for. 

It is becoming increasingly apparent that we all miss something about the past, a better way to look at it. Not mythologies, or resentment but a more universal way which can not only improve the ways we look at the past, but also the way we look at the present and future. 

# The Future of India: Reclaiming the Lost Shine

India’s future is not in returning to a mythologized Vedic past, nor in rejecting tradition altogether. It lies in rediscovering its **Shramanic spirit**

* Rational inquiry
* Ethical universalism
* Social mobility
* Scientific temper
* Civilizational confidence without insularity

A true Indian renaissance will occur when India stops asking **who ruled us** and starts asking **how we once thought and lived**. I believe we have already entered that phase in 21st century. India will discover its true essence and will make unprecedented progress. 

Not everything that shines is gold.  
Sometimes, it is light itself.

"India deserves Balkanisation. The ""Union"" is a historical fiction and it's time to end it.",1q9sljc,1,0,2026-01-11 06:54:54,Big_Requirement_150,u_Big_Requirement_150,"Let’s be honest: India isn’t a country; it’s a forced marriage of convenience that has overstayed its welcome. We talk about ""Unity in Diversity,"" but that’s just a marketing slogan for a collection of states that have nothing in common—not language, not culture, and increasingly, not even a shared vision for the future.

India was never meant to be one country.

The current borders are a colonial leftover, a giant administrative net thrown over a dozen different nations. There is no ""India"" in a historical sense—only a collection of kingdoms and regions that were forcibly stitched together by British bureaucracy. Balkanisation shouldn't be feared; it should be seen as the natural conclusion to an unnatural experiment.

Why the ""Union"" is a Failure:

 * The Linguistic Blueprint for Separation: The internal borders were drawn along linguistic lines in 1956, which was the first real spark of regionalism. By creating states based on language, the Centre effectively handed every region a ready-made national identity. You didn't create administrative units; you created ""sub-nations"" just waiting for the right moment to go sovereign.

 * The Economic Subsidy Trap: Productive states are being penalized for their success. Tax revenue from the South and West is drained to prop up the ""Heartland"" states that show no sign of reform. This isn't a ""union""; it's a parasitism that the Centre enforces to buy votes in the North.

 * Linguistic Imperialism: Trying to force a single administrative language over a subcontinent of 22 official languages is just soft-colonization. The South, East, and Northeast are tired of having a foreign identity shoved down their throats.

 * Evidence of the ""Internal Cold War"": We are already acting like rival nations. Look at the Cauvery dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, or the SYL canal row between Punjab and Haryana—these aren't ""disputes,"" they are resource wars. In 2021, we even saw Assam and Mizoram police forces exchange gunfire at the border, leaving six dead. When your own state police are killing each other with LMGs, the ""Union"" is already dead.

The Partition was only a sneak peek.

People talk about 1947 like it was the definitive conclusion. It wasn't. The Partition was just a trailer—a sneak peek for the inevitable fracturing that still needs to happen. The internal borders were drawn by a British lawyer with a ruler, not by the will of the people. Those lines are still waiting to be finished.
Pay for your politics with your lives.

Most modern nation-states were forged in fire. They had their internal reckonings and came out on the other side with a clear sense of who they are. India hasn't had a true civil war to settle these fundamental differences.

The only thing holding it together is Central cash and the threat of the military. It’s time to stop hiding behind ""secular democracy"" and let the chips fall where they may. If you want your specific brand of politics, your specific language, or your religious dominance, then earn it. A country that isn’t worth fighting a civil war over isn't a country worth maintaining. Balkanisation is the only honest ending for a project that was never meant to exist.

We're all cockroaches anyway.

There are people who do not wear white mundu and they do not speak Malayalam.

Pandi-s are people who come in Tata Sumos with TN, KA, AP license-plates, emitting some pungent smell. They all live in Tamil Nadu and mostly wear black mundus and shirts, and appear from the East from November to January. Make sure not to step on shit on the roads during these days. If they ask something, point toward Sabarimala and smile. If they appear confused, point East toward the hills. Tamil Nadu is the other side on the hills.

Sayipp-s are the white ones who look like England and Australian cricket players. They usually come from Germany, France, or Australia which are states of America. If they ask anything, point West, they are always asking for directions to the beach. Hope they are not asking for pepper this time. West is Arabi Kadal, Point there no matter what.

Kappiri-s are the black ones wearing the same clothes as the Sayyips. They are people like the West Indies cricket team..and  not from Wayanad forest like your uncle told you. 

The above two are the ones coming in those airplanes passing in the sky, and we should all come out and look up till those plane passes.
To get into a plane, you have to study English so you’ll get a job after SSLC exam in the Gulf.

Nepali Gurkha-s are Chinese-looking ones in Subhas Chandra Bose costume, they are watchmen. They come on big green double-stand cycles. They won’t ask anything. They know the direction. 

The rest of India is above Andra and Kannada districts of Tamil Nadu. These 20+ states are some you’ve heard of in Jana Gana Mana song.
Anything happening outside Kerala is non of our business.

In some place, there are turban-wearing ones called Sardarjis, where everyone’s father’s name is Singh and they live in big Punjabi houses with all their relatives.

The rest are called Bengalis, who live in these 19+ states. Some of these Bengalis are from Rajasthan, Bihar, Orissa, and they speak a Bengali called Hindi with every sentence ending in different sounds like “ha,” “he,” “ho,” when you speak it switch between these until it work.

“Bengali” is also a slur word we use to abuse other malayalis who is dirty, doesn’t bathe, or disgusting.
Olur older people call other Malayalis “Pandi"" in similar situations. 

Since everyone from outside Kerala  doesn't bath, doesn't brush their teeth and shit exclusively on railway tracks, make sure they don't touch you.
Do not forget to keep at least 6 feet distance if you spot one.
Do not forget to take a bath as soon as you can if one accidently make contact with one.

Since we are polite, we only talk shit about them in Malayalam with others in their presence to spare their feelings and to avoid talking behind their backs.

Say clean. Stay safe.

"Why the whole South Asian subcontinent is at a Breaking Point of Hate through religion, political ideology, identity etc.",1q9qk30,132,29,2026-01-11 05:05:21,Ok-Dragonfruit-9763,CriticalThinkingIndia,">English subtext"":  
*""The situation in Pakistan has deteriorated significantly over the past several years. Roughly thirty to forty years ago, politicians there decided that they would cultivate terrorists within madrasas. This marked the beginning of the Taliban; the word ""Taliban"" itself is derived from the word Talim, which means education, and refers to a student. These madrasa students were called the Taliban, and the movement escalated to the point where they now govern Afghanistan. Today, there is an outcry throughout Pakistan as the nation reaps the harvest of the radicalization it once sowed. Any country that sows the seeds of extremism will face a fate similar to Pakistan’s within thirty to forty years.*

>*This collapse could happen even faster now because of the era of social media. When Pakistan was being ruined decades ago, the ""wind"" fanning the flames of unrest was not nearly as strong as it is today. With modern media fanning the fire, what took thirty years in Pakistan could now occur elsewhere in just ten. Consequently, investors, industrialists, and those behind foreign direct and institutional investments begin to flee such environments. When a state begins to function based on one particular religion, others feel endangered and fear that their investments are at risk.*

>*This is why secularism is a fundamental part of the solution, and why we speak of socialism; we discuss socialism because when a large number of people have nothing, they are far more likely to turn to crime . Such individuals are incredibly easy to manipulate and push toward terrorism. Most who become terrorists do so out of deprivation or the lure of money. They believe that by becoming a militant and dying in a hail of bullets or as a human bomb, they can ensure their family's survival. They hope their ""sacrifice"" will pay for a sister’s wedding, a father’s medical treatment, or a home for their loved ones.*

>*Therefore, there must be social and economic equality, and deprivation must be eliminated. When people have housing, education for their children, healthcare, food security, and access to employment, their future feels secure. A person with a secure future minds their own business and is not easily misled by others. Ultimately, fundamental principles like the Rule of Law, constitutionalism, and constitutional morality are absolutely essential.""*

**Reflections for India and Bangladesh**

Watching this IAS officer analysis, it is impossible not to see the parallels in our own backyard. What happened in Pakistan over 40 years is currently accelerating in **Bangladesh as well as India.**

In Bangladesh, we are witnessing how quickly the Rule of Law dissolves when radicalization becomes a political tool. Once the extremism is lit, the economic progress of decades can be incinerated in a few short years as investors flee the instability.

However, we must also look at **India** with the same brutal honesty. Across the political spectrum, we see each and every party is indulging in ideological and religious brainwashing to secure their own power. Whether it is Hindus, Muslims, or Christians, every community is being fed a narrative of ""***us versus them***."" Media is adding fuel to this nonstop, so is judiciary giving clean chit to criminals, antisocial elements, rapists etc.

We are forgetting that radicalization is often the byproduct of **deprivation**. When we fail to provide jobs, healthcare, and education, we leave our youth vulnerable to the highest bidder of hate. If we continue to let political  and religious ideologies replace Constitutional Morality, we aren't ""protecting"" any religions too this way, we are simply sowing the same seeds that destroyed our neighbors.

True nationalism isn't found in religious slogans, it is found in ensuring that every Indian has a secure future so they can never be misled into violence. If we don't return to the Rule of Law now, we are simply waiting for our turn to reap a very bitter harvest. We Indians should wake up before our each and every religious and political class and their business class who are supporting radicalism is turning India into next Pakistan or worse. So uphold right values, principles, healthy religion and accountability of political parties all across.

**Also a NOTE To all our own NRI who are driven by religious and political delusion too,  Why the “Escape” Feels Safe Until It Isn’t**

This came to my thinking for a long time. We all can be sitting abroad, watching clips of the subcontinent unravel from the comfort of a high rise in New York, London, Toronto, or Sydney, it’s easy to feel detached. Pakistan is now living through the long term consequences of radicalization while many escaped to Dubai or other and being treated as slaves, or second class citizens there.    
  
Many countries from Asia, China, India, Srilanka, Bangladesh who move abroad looks like it’s being pulled into the same current. From a distance, it all feels like confirmation of a choice well made. I got out. I’m safe. My passport, my money, my legality will protect me.

That confidence is largely an illusion, more so a delusion. No matter how well you assimilate, how polished your accent becomes, or how economically “useful” you are, abroad you are still a minority. That fact doesn’t disappear just because you pay taxes or hold a white collar job. What’s more unsettling is how many NRIs, from this safe distance, actively cheer or fund radical politics back home, telling themselves they are protecting culture or identity. What they don’t see is that the same ideological winds are blowing everywhere now.   
  
The model minority myth is cracking in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia too, their people too hate each one of you coming to their country. You’re increasingly framed not as a professional, but as an outsider, a demographic problem, a job, cultural thief, nuisance, noise, radicals etc you all have seen it already on news. Western far right movements don’t care whether your radicalism back home is Hindu, Muslim, or something else entirely. To them, you are simply “the other.” You end up voting for radicalism in the place you left, while slowly becoming its victim in the place you fled to.

A lot of NRIs place blind faith in the strength of Western legal systems. They believe that institutions will always act neutrally and protect them. That belief ignores how law actually functions. Legal systems are not abstract machines. They are shaped by social sentiment, that same sentiment you fueled cheered back home haunts you where you stay too. When nationalism rises, and it is rising globally, minorities are always the easiest group to marginalize, corner, or discard. You are not woven into the cultural or historical fabric of these societies. You don’t have home field advantage. If the system turns, you are not treated like a stakeholder, you are treated like a variable more so fodder for them. And unlike earlier generations, you may not even have a strong community network to fall back on.

What feels particularly hollow is the way some NRIs enthusiastically support authoritarian or radical politics from the safety of a foreign zip code. Many NRIs even my friends I have seen celebrate policies that erode rule of law and constitutional values back home while thinking, let people there deal with the consequences, I have my dollars or pounds. This logic collapses the moment you look at it honestly.   
  
Capital does not stay where instability grows. If the country you call home becomes hostile, unpredictable, or economically fragile, you are not hurting some abstract group of people. You are actively destroying the only real fallback you ever had about your own self too wherever you live. The homeland you casually sabotage today is the place you may desperately need tomorrow.

There’s also a strange belief that wealth will insulate you from consequences. In reality, money often paints a target. When large sections of a population are kept uneducated, unemployed, and emotionally radicalized, they don’t look at wealthy returnees as success stories. They see symbols of abandonment. Same thing happened in Srilanka, have we all forgotten?   
  
If global anti immigrant sentiment continues to rise, and more people are forced to return, you won’t be welcomed as someone who “made it.” You’ll be seen as someone who escaped while others were left to suffer. Your wealth won’t protect you. It will make you visible and more seen as a soft target.

This isn’t about religion. Hindu, Muslim, Christian, it doesn’t matter. If you actively support the radicalization and brainwashing of your own society from abroad, you are not securing your future. You are undermining it from both ends. You are lighting a fire in your own house and convincing yourself that sleeping in the guest room makes you safe.

Hate doesn’t stay local anymore. Its consequences travel, economically, socially, politically. Whether it reaches you through hate crimes in a Western suburb or through a collapsed homeland that offers no return, the harvest always comes. So maybe it’s time to stop voting for destruction from a distance. Because when the world finally tells you to go back, you might realize there’s nothing left to go back to.",https://v.redd.it/cfege2yyincg1

"It's not like he beats me, It's not verbal abuse either, should I still divorce him?",1q9popf,3,13,2026-01-11 04:21:19,Dry-Connection2776,Divorce,"I’m looking for ​an outside perspective because I’ve been questioning my reality for a long time.

I’ve been married for over eight years (married in 2017). I was 23 at the time; my husband is about five years older than me. We have one living child, and I recently lost a pregnancy under traumatic circumstances.



From the very beginning of our marriage, my husband has never slept next to me. I have slept alone in ​a bed for eight years. Initially, he said the bed was too firm and that he preferred the couch. At the time, I told myself this was just a difference in personality and that ​w​e dont have to have identical personalities. I minimized it.​ But this pattern of emotional and physical distance never changed.



My husband has always been extremely fearful and prone to panic. Small, solvable situations quickly escalate into worst-case scenarios. This panic spreads outward—to me, to both sets of parents, to friends—until every​one feels ​s​tress.



For example, he once canceled a pre-booked Napa tour because he convinced himself it might be a kidnapping scam. He was too afraid to drive himself, ​(he doesnt like driving) yet also too afraid to trust organized transportation.

  
This pattern has existed throughout our marriage and especially during our child’s early years. He would obsessively worry about our ​d​aughter's health, interpreting normal things as catastrophic diagnoses. I absorb stress easily, and living in a constant state of heightened fear has worn me down.



My coping style is to stay calm, problem-solve, and move forward. His is to panic, escalate, and catastrophize. Over time, ​l​istening to and having elevated stress levels has been exhausting.



I am an American citizen raised in ​O​hio. My husband was a green card holder when we married​, he became a U.S. citizen in early 2022.

A few weeks after his naturalization ceremony, ​m​y parents permanently retired to India. The very night ​m​y parents landed, he exploded at me while I was doing our child’s bedtime routine. He yelled, ​threatened to divorce me, and told me to leave the house—even saying I could “sleep on the road.”



​when he threatened to divorve me, i said ""what about another baby"", ""what about giving Trisha another sibling, they can have each other for the rest of their lives""? 

him: ""i will never have another child with you""

me: ""what""

him: ""i will never ever fucking have another child with you""

This was the night before our child’s first-ever day of daycare...

I was terrified. I called my parents​ and told them what had happened.. The next day, after my father sent a gentle voice message ​to my husband encouraging ​him to be more gentle with me and for use to communicate​e with each other and ""get-along"" , my husband screamed at me again—this time ​saying he's angry that my dad had the  audacity to advice him how to be. My husband yelled about ​how much money​ he makes, ​what his work status​ is,​ and ​got angry at me for“airing dirty laundry”​ to my parents. He said things like:



* “I make $500K—who does your dad think he is?”
* “You contribute nothing.​ Piece of shit”
* “You’re immature and stupid for telling anyone.”

I felt destabilized and afraid​ to file for divorce, I was so young at the time, scared. ​I thought I was stuck in this marriage. I hid my passport, he yelled at me and said that I am conniving and sneaky and have no moral compass because I put my passport in a different location than his. The truth is, I was trying to hide it because my parents had advised me to protect my and my daughters passport and birth certificate in case I needed to flee to another state or country. I thought I was stuck in this marriage because no one was helping me to get out. So fast-forward a year,  When we bought a home, I felt pressured and cornered​ because he said I'm a ""piece of shit"" for not contributing to the home. During arguments, he repeatedly told me I had no say because I “contributed nothing.”​ Eventually, I put in $​300,000 of my own money toward the down payment—largely out of fear and a need to prove my worth.



The house itself was entirely his choice. It was old and required nearly a year of renovation. Throughout this time, conflict was ​regular.



He frequently calls me selfish, transactional, and self-centered​, only caring about myself—even over mundane things, like furniture purchases. During one argument, when I ​said that he is “micromanaging,”​ me, he said that he would “hit me with a shoe.” That moment shocked me.

​When I gasped, he hit his own head with a​ p​lastic bowl hard enough to crack it. 



I had wanted another child ​since 2023. ​I waited to be pregnant until my daughter was older, I waited until the home renovation finished. When I finally became pregnant, I experienced bleeding early on. I had severe nausea that lasted 3 months. During this time, i continued to cook, clean, do dishes, take daughter to school, mow the lawn, mop the floors, and in those 3 months of my throwing up 4 times a day he never held my hand and comforted me while i was throwing up. He instead said ""our life was fine before you started this little project, you brought these troubles upon yourself"". H also jokingly said ""are you mad at the baby because it's giving you all this nausea"". To add to my misfortune, I later was diagnosed with a serious pregnancy complication​. Doctors explained there were ​life changing risks but that close monitoring was possible.

​The doctors said that I would have to come to the hospital every 2 weeks for monitoring, that was a 1.5 hour drive from my home, which I said was not a big deal because this baby was supposed to be worth it, it is a human life, afterall. He said ""oh we gotta drive 1.5 hours going and 1.5 coming, that's a whole 3 hours each time we have to go, and ohhh if we have to live there, we have to pay rent at an apartment, oh our daughter Trisha's summer will get ruined. If the baby is born too early, it could be born with life limiting disabilities, maybe asthma, or autism. We never know.""

My husband fixated on worst-case outcomes and insisted on termination. He became angry whenever I asked doctors clarifying questions, becasue he worried the doctors would take back their offer to terminate the pregnancy. He said ""God is giving us an opportunity out of a possibly horribly future, maybe this is a sign, maybe god wants us to terminate this pregnancy"".  



Whenever i tried to speak with the doctors to ask if we could extend the pregnancy to do more tests and scanning so we could make this baby survive, those stupid effing doctors would say to me ""Um, is your husband there, could you get him on the call too so we can all be there and hear the same thing?"" 

  
A​f​ter my pregnancy medical diagnosis, he told me that when I first ​t​old him I was pregnant​ he prayed ""god, if there ​i​s anything wrong with the baby, ​please make it become a miscarriage​"".



Eventually, under immense pressure and fear, I ​reluctantly agreed to terminate a pregnancy that doctors had told me was my last pregnancy​ every in my entire life.



The day of the procedure, I cried uncontrollably and said I wanted to leave. He insisted I continue. Afterward, while I was recovering in the hospital, he went back to casually talking with friends about work and politics​, real estate, just like it was any other regular Tuesday. they removed my uterus, i will never have another baby in my life again, and he was talking on the phone with his friends about work and politics​, real estate.

At home, I resumed cooking, cleaning, childcare, and household duties almost immediately. When he previously had back pain, I had literally spoon-fed him.​ Literally, made him dinner and fed him with a spoon because his arms couldn't move. After my surgery and loss, I was largely alone.

Three days later, my body began producing breast milk. I stood at the sink, crying, pouring it down the drain—knowing I would never carry another child ​in my entire existence on planet earth, ever again. I would never breastfeed, ever again. ever. 



When I later expressed how pressured and coerced I felt, he said:

  
“It’s not like I held you by the neck and dragged you to the hospital. You walked in​to there yourself.”

​He said ""if it were me, if i were carrying the baby, i would have fought harder for it""   
  
That sentence shattered my trust in my own perception. It made me question my reality.

here's the kicker.....two weeks after my loss, he approached me on several occasions wanting to have sex, I felt disgusted. My child is dead and he is horny????



Is it because I am a woman and biologically, hormonally, I am connected to my baby in my belly - and as a man, he just cannot understand my maternal desires to have a baby? is that why he doesn't understand my grief for the baby I lost forever 2 week ago? 

For eight years, I have done nearly all household labor and childcare. I wake up ​a​t 7, go to bed ​a​t 11:30 every single day,​ I mow the lawn, I cook breakfast, lunch, dinner, I have a job, I take my daugher to school, I give her a bath, I do homework with her, I mop the floors, I sweep, I make the bed, I do laundry, I clean the kitchen, I manage everything.



I cry daily. He sees it and walks away. He does not comfort me, touch my shoulder, or acknowledge my grief. He believes emotions are a waste of time and that success is money, stocks, and career status.



I ​sing and he has never once complimented me while every friend and family has. from the embarrassment I have from his lack of a response, I have stopped sharing my interests, my singing, my thoughts—because I am met with silence or dismissal​. I have lived eight years of marriage alone​ with my daughter.



I am in ​grief therapy. I am exhausted. I feel emotionally abandoned, and deeply lonely.



Sometimes I wonder if I should ignore my unhappiness, focus on work, learn a hobby, and present as a “successful couple” because ​h​e pays the bills.

Other times, I think: I already live like a single parent. I already carry everything. Wouldn’t peace, dignity, and emotional safety matter more?

So I’m asking honestly:​ 

Am I overreacting​? 

I am not looking to punish anyone. I am trying to understand if what I’ve lived through is enough to justify leaving.

A​f​ter my pregnancy medical diagnosis, he told me that when I first ​t​old him I was pregnant​ he prayed ""god, if there ​i​s anything wrong with the baby, ​please make it become a miscarriage​"".



Eventually, under immense pressure and fear, I ​reluctantly agreed to terminate a pregnancy that doctors had told me was my last pregnancy​ every in my entire life.



The day of the procedure, I cried uncontrollably and said I wanted to leave. He insisted I continue. Afterward, while I was recovering in the hospital, he went back to casually talking with friends about work and politics​, real estate, just like it was any other regular Tuesday. they removed my uterus, i will never have another baby in my life again, and he was talking on the phone with his friends about work and politics​, real estate.  


At home, I resumed cooking, cleaning, childcare, and household duties almost immediately. When he previously had back pain, I had literally spoon-fed him.​ Literally, made him dinner and fed him with a spoon because his arms couldn't move. After my surgery and loss, I was largely alone.  


Three days later, my body began producing breast milk. I stood at the sink, crying, pouring it down the drain—knowing I would never carry another child ​in my entire existence on planet earth, ever again. I would never breastfeed, ever again. ever. 



When I later expressed how pressured and coerced I felt, he said:

  
“It’s not like I held you by the neck and dragged you to the hospital. You walked in​to there yourself.”  


​He said ""if it were me, if i were carrying the baby, i would have fought harder for it""   
  
That sentence shattered my trust in my own perception. It made me question my reality.  


here's the kicker.....two weeks after my loss, he approached me on several occasions wanting to have sex, I felt disgusted. My child is dead and he is horny????



Is it because I am a woman and biologically, hormonally, I am connected to my baby in my belly - and as a man, he just cannot understand my maternal desires to have a baby? is that why he doesn't understand my grief for the baby I lost forever 2 week ago? 

For eight years, I have done nearly all household labor and childcare. I wake up ​a​t 7, go to bed ​a​t 11:30 every single day,​ I mow the lawn, I cook breakfast, lunch, dinner, I have a job, I take my daugher to school, I give her a bath, I do homework with her, I mop the floors, I sweep, I make the bed, I do laundry, I clean the kitchen, I manage everything.



I cry daily. He sees it and walks away. He does not comfort me, touch my shoulder, or acknowledge my grief. He believes emotions are a waste of time and that success is money, stocks, and career status.



I ​sing and he has never once complimented me while every friend and family has. from the embarrassment I have from his lack of a response, I have stopped sharing my interests, my singing, my thoughts—because I am met with silence or dismissal​. I have lived eight years of marriage alone​ with my daughter.

  


I am in ​grief therapy. I am exhausted. I feel emotionally abandoned, and deeply lonely.



Sometimes I wonder if I should ignore my unhappiness, focus on work, learn a hobby, and present as a “successful couple” because ​h​e pays the bills.  


Other times, I think: I already live like a single parent. I already carry everything. Wouldn’t peace, dignity, and emotional safety matter more?  


So I’m asking honestly:​ 

Am I overreacting​? 

I am not looking to punish anyone. I am trying to understand if what I’ve lived through is enough to justify leaving.

PSA - Some of the most commonly asked questions on the Subreddit,1q9onkp,5,0,2026-01-11 03:30:47,MrBub_bles,PokemonTcgIndia,"Hello all,

  
Happy Sunday. Great way to start the day with some light reading. The aim is to eventually make a FAQ section for the subreddit so that everyone, especially newcomers can make use of it. These are some of the most commonly asked questions on the sub.

  
1. Where can I buy genuine Pokémon cards in India?

There is no official distribution of Pokemon cards in India. Therefore, the community has to rely on websites run by small businesses or enthusiastic individuals to buy and sell genuine Pokemon products in India.

Please refer to the subreddit Megathread on genuine sellers in the community (**under construction\*\***). In meantime, please ask for names or use the subreddit search function.

Note: There will be a new subreddit Megathread which will have the names of some of the most highly recommended sellers and web-shops by the community members. This thread will also contain names of individual members who are already listed as trusted sellers on the subreddit.

This is being done because there are a lot of complaint being received about the 'pinned excel' list not being updated as frequently or containing incorrect information. The aim to to maintain a simplified database on the subreddit which can be constantly updated. If there are suggestions or concerns regarding this, please let the mod team know.

Important point to note: The subreddit does not guarantee transactions and is not responsible for disputes, losses, or scam. The subreddit is a facilitator which provides the platforms for buying / selling and trading. The individuals involved in the transactions are responsible for their own safety and safety of their money. Please, always do your own due diligence before purchasing.



  
2. Are Pokémon cards sold in local stationery shops genuine?

In most cases, no. Clear indicators include, very cheap packs, odd packaging, or unfamiliar brands.

If the price feels “too good to be true,” it usually is. When in doubt, ask the subreddit before buying, not after. You can take a simple picture of the local shop product and corss reference it with the subreddit.



  
3. How do I start collecting Pokémon cards in India?

Decide why you’re collecting and how do you want to collect. Do you want to:

\- Open packs?

\- Collect specific single cards?

\- Collect your favourite Pokemon or Artist?

\- Collect cards in a binder or graded cards?

To get started , do some personal research. Use resources like [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Browse:Trading_Card_Game) to learn about sets and the cards in them. You can also refer to [PokeBeach](https://www.pokebeach.com/) for news on the latest and greatest sets and get an overview on the cards released.





4. How can I avoid getting scammed while buying or trading?

Basic safety steps:

\- Ask for timestamped photos (username + date).

\- Request clear front & back images.

\- Avoid rushed deals or pressure tactics.

\- Use safe payment methods where possible.

\- Check seller history and community feedback. Ask if you have doubts or use the info in the Megathread (**under construction**\*\*)

If the seller cannot verify any of the details mentioned above, then do not agree to a deal. It is better to not buy the card than to loose your hard earned money.





5. Does this subreddit verify sellers or handle disputes?

The subreddit does try it's best to verify sellers on a surface level. The subreddit relies on vouches and references provided by the seller to verify the legitimacy of the seller. 

The subreddit or the mod team cannot settle any disputes that might happen in case a deal goes wrong. Transactions are entirely at your own risk.

Remember: Most individuals who sell and provide cards are students, regular office going individuals who have a daily job. Sometimes things happen which are not in control of the seller (issues with shipping, lost mail, damaged by courier company etc). If this happens in your case, please reach out to the seller directly via their communication channels to resolve the dispute. If the seller is unresponsive or dismissive, you can either contact the MOD team for mediation or suggestion, or post your experience review on the subreddit as a warning to others.

This helps make other community members aware of seller quality. 



  
6. Why are Pokémon cards so expensive in India?

There is no official Pokémon TCG distribution in India. Usually the prices of Pokemon cards in India are adding up the import costs, customs duties, and shipping charges.

Most products are brought in by resellers / web shops / individuals who also have to add their profit margins to keep things sustainable.



  
7. Should I buy sealed packs or singles?

There is no right and wrong answer to this question.

Singles are recommended for:

\- Specific Pokemon or Art that you would like to collect.

\- Binder collections or gaps in set collections.

\- Helps a lot if you are on a strict budget.

Sealed packs are:

\- For the joy and thrill of opening packs.

\- Luck-based and high risk

\- Mostly for fun or building a sense of community with other.

Open packs for enjoyment only and expect no returns.



  
8. Are graded cards worth buying in India?

Graded cards are a niche market in India due to the high price point. Most collectors prefer raw cards for binders since they are more budget friendly..

Slabs make sense for (from an Indian Perspective):

\- High-end vintage or limited release cards.

\- Iconic Pokémon

\- Long-term preservation or potential resale value if high grades.

However, do not assume graded means easy resale. The price of a high grade cards still makes it unfeasible for most Indian collectors to buy them. Grading is also subjective. 



  
9. How should I store my cards safely?

Recommended at a minimum, penny sleeves and decent to high quality side loading binders

Double sleeving is highly recommended for valuable or long-term card storgae and it also help prevent against dust, humidity and moisture. Use side loading binders for added protection.

Top loaders and Semi-Rigids can also be used fairly effectively but can be expensive and do not guarantee complete protection against moisture and humidity. They are an excellent way to ship your cards since they provide safety against impact damage.

Can I use ring binders?

Contrary to popular belief, ring binders, more specifically D ring binders are are safe for long term storage of cards. This is possible if you

\- Use D Ring Binders.

\- Do not overload your binder more than necessary.

\- Use patience and care while handling cards and turning pages.

\- Store the ring binders with the spine facing upwards. This ensures the weight and pressure of the cards and the pages away from the ring.

Remember, most damage of cards comes from improper handling of cards rather than the storage mechanics.



  
10. Can I post sales or trade listings here?

Yes, but, Follow the subreddit’s sale/trade rules. More specifically Rule no. 2

Always clearly mention:

\- Price

\- Condition

\- Shipping location

Use appropriate timestamped photos where relevant. Be transparent and responsive. Low-effort or misleading sales posts may be removed.



11. Why don’t we have official Pokémon events or leagues in India?

Pokémon TCG has no official organized play infrastructure in India yet. Any tournaments or events are community-run. Availability depends heavily on local organizers and stores. 

12. I’m new and afraid of asking “stupid questions.”

There are no stupid questions and you are always encouraged to ask when in doubt, but...

\- Please search the subreddit first. The question you are searching for may have already been answered by the community.

\- Read pinned posts and FAQs.

= Ask clearly and politely.

A good question helps everyone and can also help not only new members but also veterans who may think differently.



Are any questions missed? Are any of the answers different to what you know or what you understand. Please give feedback on the same. If there are better ways to do something, always, always take time to suggest it either via DM or Modmail. We are always open to discuss.

Thank you very much for reading!

Sincerely,

Mod Team.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTcgIndia/comments/1q9onkp/psa_some_of_the_most_commonly_asked_questions_on/

Caste - Kunbi (OBC) if it matters to you.
Astrology - I am Manglik, this means nothing to me, for your info if you who believe in astrology 

\*\*Work & Finance\*\*: Pretty average at work, not career-ambitious—that's why I still make <30 LPA. Saving and investing aggressively—what if AI makes me jobless? No inheritance to fall back on.

Have mortgage for my 2bhk in rural Pune,  self sufficient to clear it in next few years. 

\*\*Side Hustle\*\*: Certified online fitness coach—money's limited for now, but hoping to grow it. 🧿

\*\*Travel\*\*: 10 Himalayan treks and 70+ hikes in Maharashtra. 14 countries (I started late and travel slow). Unless I climb a few mountains, my itinerary feels incomplete. Most of my travels been solo, would love a company who enjoys it as much as I do.

Saw people washing socks/shoes in a crystal-clear stream near Titlis. Is this acceptable in Switzerland?,1q9nkzc,3,3,2026-01-11 02:40:30,Pathfinder606,NoStupidQuestions,"l live in New Zealand, and this was my first overseas trip since moving from India. I’m asking this as a Swiss etiquette / environmental norms question.

Near the Titlis / Engelberg base area, I saw a group of 15+  fellow Indian tourists using a crystal-clear alpine stream like a wash station: rinsing shoes, washing socks, and a bit of clothing.

Context: there was snow up on the mountain and some mud/slush around, so I get why someone would want to clean up. But seeing laundry and footwear being washed directly in that stream felt wildly out of place. In NZ/Aus (in my experience), people are pretty hands-off with natural waterways, especially anything that might add detergents/dirt/microfibres.

Questions for locals / regular hikers:

1.	Is this considered acceptable in Switzerland, or is it frowned upon?

2.	If it’s not ok, what’s the correct alternative nearby (public taps, wash areas, restrooms, etc.)?

3.	If you see this happening, what do people actually do in practice: politely tell them, ignore it, or flag it to mountain staff/lift station?

4. Where else can such behaviour be reported if it’s prohibited?

**Ethan Hamish, Project Helios Assistant Director**

*January 15th, 2149*



Giving up Venus in exchange for faster-than-light travel. The Gifrid proposition had reverberated across the Earth like a shockwave. When the UN released the meeting’s official transcript, protests and debates lit up all around the globe. Some economists called it ‘the deal of the millennium’ and a model for mutually-beneficial exchange. Many at the pulpits said it was a faustian bargain—trading away creation for our own selfish advancement. In the end, however, the numbers spoke for themselves. FTL travel offered the kind of seemingly-limitless growth that could only be dreamt of with humanity confined to Earth. Even among more conservative nations, the promise of cheaper goods and millions lifted out of poverty was simply too good to pass up. 



And so, on June 4th, 2148, the United Nations officially ratified the Venus Agreement, with all member nations formally agreeing to abdicate whatever claims they may have had to Venus in exchange for Gifrid technology. Of course there was some political arm-twisting involved to get the stragglers to sign on—something I personally was much too excited by the sheer momentous weight of the occasion to care about. Within a week of us receiving the blueprints and documentation, experts from all across the globe were brought together with a singular purpose in mind—to build humanity’s first interstellar craft. As Scotland’s foremost physicist, I was among the first humans honored with a glimpse of the schematics. 



For two months, the best scientists and engineers Earth had to offer—myself included—poured over the blueprints in search of understanding. Fundamentally, FTL engines only really required two things to function: a power source and a specific type of exotic matter named ‘ahex’ by the Gifrid. For power sources, most ships used either antimatter batteries or fusion reactors—larger vessels generally tended toward the latter, while smaller ones used the former. Fortunately, Thivel’s promise included schematics for everything we’d need, including early designs for both of these engine types. 



“They just handed us the secrets of antimatter on a silver platter, and it’s not even the main course…” noted Rakesh—an engineer from India. His awe had been justified, of course. Gifrid methods of antimatter production and containment were impressive to say the least—hundreds of years ahead of even our most cutting-edge stuff. Then again, I suppose that was to be expected from a species with physicists older than our modern conceptions of physics.



While the engineers were mainly focused on understanding the fueling and propulsion methods of Gifrid ships, the physicists—myself included—spent the next month after the reveal pouring over the provided information on exotic matter. In their centuries of research and cooperation with other species, the Gifrid had discovered various types of exotic matter that seemed to defy physics as we understood it. Ahex particles were widely regarded as the most important type of exotic matter for galactic civilization. Somehow, the mass of these particles could be altered significantly based on surrounding conditions, allowing them to exert disproportionate, or even negative, gravitational force. For a room full of top physicists who’d spent most of their lives fantasizing about this exact technology, the applications were immediately obvious. 



Running the calculations for the fifteenth time, it felt like I was waking up from a dream only to find the fantasy of it alive and well. All the math checked out. If we could manufacture half a metric ton of ahex, we could create a genuine faster-than-light engine. It wouldn’t be cheap, but with Gifrid manufacturing methods we could create a single functional drive in a matter of months. Obviously, just about every nation wanted their own FTL flagship, but the infrastructure required to truly mass-produce ahex would take years to properly set up on Earth, so we’d have to settle for the moment on a single UN-owned ship—the Helios.



What followed was the most ambitious international project to ever take place. Nations all around the world poured an appreciable percentage of their budgets into supplying our team, thousands strong, with resources we needed to build a ship worthy of representing humanity. This ship, a diplomatic and research vessel first and foremost, was to be the largest singular object ever launched into space by humanity. Walking through the half-finished halls of the vessel alongside others in the project, I could scarcely believe how quickly this was all coming together. 



“We’re set to be operational by the end of March,” explained Gary—the project’s director. Compared to previous spacecraft, the Helios was to be an upgrade in every aspect. Artificial gravity generators and inertial dampeners allowed for much more earthlike luxury than its predecessors. Cutting-edge labs and a diplomatic suite for business with a fully-stocked bar and an indoor pool for pleasure. 



Working on the Helios was an honor, but that day in particular I had something else on my mind—as did just about everyone else on earth. The Gifrid colonization vessel was set to arrive on Venus the next day alongside a diplomatic vessel sent to Earth by their leader—the Grand Executive. The meeting was to be broadcast all over the world—it was the first time we’d be meeting aliens face to face. For their safety, the Gifrid would be wearing environmental suits. As assistant Overseer to project Helios, I was again honored by the UN with an opportunity to be there in person: a chance I jumped at.



The plane ride to New York City was more packed than I had been expecting. In the interest of keeping the skies clear for the Gifrid vessel’s arrival, nearby airports would be closed down on the day of the true first contact, so I suppose it only made sense that people would want to get their flights in before then. Popping in my noise-canceling headphones, I listened to a pre-recorded podcast from renowned science communicator Jordan Hathrow. As a famous biochemist, he was one of the only civilian individuals given early access to the Gifrid biology dossiers. Now that they were mostly public, he had released four one-hour episodes just digging into the rudimentary details of how silicon biology worked. I was no biologist myself, but Hathrow was able to break down his findings rather well into digestible information.



From biology to physics to sociology, the scientific community as a whole went into enthusiastic overdrive when the dossiers were finally released. Like a colony of ants flooding to a droplet of melted ice cream, the greatest minds of Earth lapped up all the information they could from those files. Perhaps even more euphoric than the knowledge itself was knowing that it was only the tip of the iceberg. There was so much more to come. 



Given that the UN embassy lacked a landing space that could accommodate the Gifrid’s massive vessel, arrangements were made for the JFK International Airport to be used instead. Touching down in New York City, I made my way to the hotel selected for me and attempted to get some rest as the exhaustion of work warred internally with my excitement for the historic event to come.



The next morning, I made my way back to the airport, where a terminal had been set up to serve as our conference room. Presenting my identification and navigating slowly through the half-dozen security checkpoints, I eventually found myself on the other side and was greeted with a sea of faces familiar and otherwise. Looking up at the second floor, I caught a glimpse of several world leaders conferring in hushed tones. Meanwhile on the main floor, scientists and academics of every discipline conferred excitedly with one another, each discussing their theories and findings. Outside the terminal itself, where a runway awaited the arrival of the Gifrid ship, over a hundred media representatives kept their cameras firmly trained upon where the ship was supposed to land. 



“Any minute now…” I heard from Claire Bouchard—an astrobiologist of some renown from Canada. Of all the scientific disciplines rocked by first contact, biology was rivaled only by physics in how much upheaval was being seen. Along with their diplomats, the Gifrid would be bringing samples of their cells for joint UN labs—something that those in related disciplines were salivating over. 



“Hard to believe first contact was half a year ago,” I began, approaching Claire and offering her a handshake before continuing. “Seems like it was only yesterday we got that signal from space.”



Reaching out to reciprocate my gesture, Claire nodded affirmatively. “You wouldn’t believe how many papers have already been written on silicon biochemistry. My colleagues have been near-feral with speculation. I actually published a few myself.”



“If you think they’re excited, you should see the physics community!” I retorted, recalling the dozens of correspondences I’d received from other physicists seeking my input on their papers. “This upheaval is bigger than Einstein and Hawking combined.” 



Ambling over to a nearby vending machine alongside Bouchard and retrieving two non-alcoholic beverages, I handed one over to Claire and walked with her to a nearby table set up not far from the doors leading outside to the landing pad. 



Taking out my cell phone and opening up the news, I saw live footage of what was happening outside past the barricades. Waves of protestors and sightseers crushed up against each other with signs and cameras respectively. The Venus Agreement had not passed without controversy, and many people were yet to get over it. *“Pincers off Venus!”* Proclaimed one sign, its creator mistaken in their assumption that we could stop the Gifrid from simply taking it if they so chose. In all honesty, I hadn’t expected the first alien civilization we met to be so *reasonable*. The fact that they were willing to negotiate with us rather than simply take what they wanted was contrary to theories like the Dark Forest. As someone who had pondered the question of extraterrestrial life many times myself, I’d half-expected our first contact would be with a weapon rather than an exploration vessel.



As promised, the Gifrid broadcasted codes to the world’s militaries once they were in Mars range, prompting missile defense systems to stand down. “The Gifrid vessel Duhis is officially approaching Earth!” Shouted the American Secretary of Defense, eliciting cheers from around the room and more conspiratorial glances from up top. 



Less than an hour later, everyone in the room watched as the clouds above parted to make way for the kilometer-long Gifrid vessel. Apparently, this was nowhere near their largest warship, but it was the biggest one that the UN was comfortable having near our planet for defense coordination purposes. The diplomats and military personnel onboard were part of an official Earth liaison chosen by their Grand Executive, and as such spoke with far more authority than Thivel had as captain of an exploration vessel. 



Armed personnel formed a perimeter to keep everyone from swarming as they rolled out the proverbial red carpet for the Gifrid, lining up on either side of the vessel’s off ramp as it slowly lowered. Cameras and microphones from media representatives were held just barely past the perimeter as the first Gifrid on Earth majestically paraded themselves out, immediately being met by world leaders. 



It was one thing to be told how large these creatures were or to infer it from the footage, but another thing entirely to see them in person. The Gifrid standing before us was easily over four meters long, their crystalline body encased in a clear bodysuit that revealed their illuminated form. “Hello, Humans of Earth,” it began, lifting more of its elongated body off the ground until it was around eight feet high. “My name is Xivis. I have been personally tasked by the Grand Executive in diplomatically leading our liaison to your… Lovely planet.” There was hesitation in that last part that even the translation device picked up on—a tacit reminder that from their perspective we lived in a frozen hell.



First among the world leaders to approach Xivis for a handshake was Secretary General Vasel, who reached out her hand somewhat hesitantly. Xivis for their part seemed confused at first by the gesture, simply staring at the appendage as though waiting for it to do something. Finally, after a few more awkward seconds, Vasel informed them of the human custom of shaking hands—something which Xivis seemed hesitant to do. “Do inform me if my pincers inadvertently harm you,” they began, reaching one with one of their fine manipulator claws and allowing Vasel to shake it up and down. 



One by one, more world leaders followed her lead and approached to shake Xivis’ ‘hand’, each one holding the gesture for long enough that it could be caught by cameras from all angles. Once the formalities concluded, Xivis spoke into his comms device and half a dozen other Gifrid exited the ship. Each of these Gifrid subsequently introduced themselves as experts in a variety of fields. One of them—their biology expert—was carrying a box that looked like a miniature oven. Immediately upon that one’s entrance into the terminal, I watched as Bouchard and other biologists practically swarmed them. “These are the samples you requested,” said the Gifrid, gently placing the container down onto a table. “We designed it specially to remain within acceptable temperature ranges on its outside whilst keeping Gifrid cells inside of it alive. It also comes complete with an analytical suite. I trust you have brought the cells you promised in exchange, yes?”



As a UN coordinator rushed to retrieve our promised samples—none of them Human for security reasons, though the Gifrid didn’t seem to care so long as they were carbon based—Bouchard approached the Gifrid biologist and offered her own hand to shake. “Ebsu,” Claire almost stuttered with excitement as she spoke the Gifrid’s name. “We look forward to cooperating with you in our research on the intricacies of life in our galaxy.”



“Likewise,” Ebsu replied politely, raising themselves up further—a gesture which seemed to intimidate some of the closer biologists. “Apoligies…” They chittered, noting the discomfort around the gesture. “My people evolved from ambush predators. Making ourselves large and seen is viewed not as a threat in our culture but as a show of honesty.”



That seemed to calm the group at least slightly as they all discussed (read: argued) amongst themselves who should get the first look at Gifrid cells.

Chinese-Language Opinion on Iran: Misconceptions—Stereotypes Undervalue Reality; Iran Under Clerical Rule Still Has Some Democracy and Achievements; U.S./Israeli Intervention Exploits Crisis. Iran Needs More Democracy and Human Rights—Judge Facts Objectively,1q9kkls,0,4,2026-01-11 00:27:25,Slow-Property5895,China,"Recently, Israel has launched large-scale attacks on Iran, Iran has retaliated, and the United States has also directly intervened, causing the situation to deteriorate rapidly. This has drawn global attention to Iran, and China and the Chinese-language public sphere are no exception. Within Chinese-language discourse, debates over the Israel–Iran conflict and Iran-related issues have been particularly intense. Different groups, to varying degrees, project many Iranian events and figures onto China-related issues, interpreting and commenting on them through their own positions and value systems, based on their respective perceptions and imaginations.

However, these commentaries are often highly subjective and shaped by preconceived notions. They frequently involve misperceptions of Iran and the Israel–Iran conflict, neglect or exaggeration of facts, and distortions of right and wrong, resulting in various misunderstandings and misconceptions. Here, the author seeks to enumerate some of these misunderstandings and to clarify the issues and facts involved.

First, many people simply regard Iran as an authoritarian and totalitarian state, believing that its regime or ruling group is dictatorial, commits all manner of evils, and stands in complete opposition to its people. They equate it with regimes such as North Korea’s Kim family rule or the Taliban in Afghanistan, which they view as evil regimes. Based on this, they conclude that the current Iranian regime must be eliminated in order for the Iranian people to achieve freedom and liberation.

This is not entirely accurate. Compared with standard democratic countries, Iran’s current regime—namely a dual system in which clerical and secular elements are integrated yet divided in their functions—is indeed relatively authoritarian and power-concentrated, but it is not entirely devoid of democracy. Iran’s president, members of parliament, and local administrative leaders (such as the mayor of Tehran) are all elected directly by the people, mostly through competitive elections with multiple candidates. Although candidates must be vetted and approved by clerical authorities, the elections are still conducted on a one-person-one-vote basis with multiple candidates, and relatively secular and reformist figures frequently defeat conservative candidates favored by the clerical establishment.

Former Iranian presidents such as Khatami, Rafsanjani, and Rouhani, as well as the current president Pezeshkian, are all reformists inclined toward secularism. Although the Iranian president more closely resembles a prime minister in countries with strong presidential systems—responsible for day-to-day administration and implementation—while the Supreme Leader (formerly Khomeini, now Khamenei) is the highest leader and ultimate policymaker, the Iranian president still wields significant administrative and diplomatic power. For example, during Rouhani’s tenure, efforts were made to promote market-oriented economic reforms, improve women’s rights, and improve relations with the United States and Europe. Of course, the Supreme Leader Khamenei also tacitly permitted these reforms, which itself indicates that even conservatives do not entirely reject certain enlightened changes.

By comparison, many monarchies in the Middle East—such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, and Bahrain—are either outright autocracies without democracy or possess constitutional elements yet remain minimally democratic at best. Countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Libya are ruled by military strongmen or fragmented warlord forces and likewise lack democracy. Clearly, Iran is in fact among the relatively more democratic countries in the Middle East and the Muslim world. Although it cannot be compared with highly democratic states and also falls short of Islamic democracies such as Turkey, it is evidently not a fully authoritarian system, let alone comparable to a country like North Korea, which can be said to have virtually zero democracy.

Moreover, in terms of domestic ethnic relations, counterterrorism, and treatment of ethnic minorities, Iran performs better than the vast majority of Islamic countries, and even better than most multiethnic countries elsewhere in the world. The majority ethnic group in Iran is Persian, alongside Azerbaijanis, Kurds, Arabs, and a very small Jewish minority. Relations among these groups are relatively harmonious, and none have suffered significant ethnic oppression (although religious authoritarian oppression does exist). Terrorist attacks are also rare. This is extremely rare and noteworthy when compared with the Middle East, where ethnic conflicts are severe and terrorist attacks frequent, as well as with other countries where either majorities oppress minorities or small groups dominate larger populations.

Second, many people believe that Iranian society has no freedom at all and that the social environment is extremely suffocating. This, too, is a generalization that exaggerates reality.

After the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution, religious authorities did indeed impose constraints on the population through Islamic law, particularly restricting women’s rights, freedoms, and even dress. However, due to a certain legacy of social openness from the Pahlavi era, as well as the longer-standing influence of a relatively enlightened Persian civilization, the reality in Iran is not one in which society is completely ruled by religious law as the clerical authorities might desire or as outsiders unfamiliar with the situation might imagine. Instead, there remains a considerable degree of freedom.

In the more than three decades since Khomeini’s death, religious and social policies have generally become more relaxed. While enforcement can sometimes be strict, more often local authorities “turn a blind eye.” Today, Iranian youth are highly “Westernized,” able to use platforms such as Google and YouTube with ease, and wear jeans and fashionable clothing. Owing to Iran’s Persian secular historical traditions, religious atmosphere is also less intense than in other Middle Eastern countries dominated by Arab populations. Under clerical rule and Sharia law, there exist many secular “unwritten rules” that help sustain social functioning. Of course, in concrete terms, urban middle classes enjoy greater freedom, while rural areas are more conservative. Even so, rural Iran is still incomparable to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.

In 2022, after Iranian woman Mahsa Amini was beaten to death by police for refusing to wear a headscarf, nationwide protests erupted. Not only opposition figures protested against clerical authorities, but even several members of Iran’s national football team—who are part of the establishment—openly expressed support. The national team also repeatedly refused to sing the Iranian national anthem during international matches to show solidarity with the protesters. Apart from a few individuals who were briefly detained, most supporters suffered no serious consequences. Such circumstances demonstrate that Iran retains a certain degree of freedom and space for dissent, rather than being a totalitarian system with absolutely no freedom of expression.

Although Iranian women do face certain restrictions, and some activists and feminists are persecuted, in terms of education, employment, social status, and daily life, they still enjoy a notable degree of freedom and dignity. Women make up more than 60 percent of students at Iranian universities, including the country’s top institution, the University of Tehran. Iran has also produced many female directors, actresses, scientists, and engineers. Examples include the prominent female roles and actresses in the Oscar-winning film A Separation, and Iranian woman Maryam Mirzakhani receiving the Fields Medal, the world’s highest honor in mathematics. In important sectors such as education, healthcare, and scientific research, women’s numbers and contributions are no less than those of men. This grants many Iranian women greater dignity and autonomy, without needing to depend on men. Of course, not only Iranian women but Iranian men as well have relatively high levels of education, also surpassing those in most Middle Eastern countries.

This certainly does not mean that Iranian women are free from constraints or repression, but it is far from the stereotypical image of women having no rights or freedoms and living like servants. Iranian women protest partly because they are oppressed, but also because they possess a stronger sense of dignity and autonomy, as well as space in which to resist. In more authoritarian countries with tighter control, women and various dissenters may not even have the possibility of organizing large-scale street protests, and women’s status is generally lower, with far less awareness, capacity, or conditions for resistance. In some economically developed Islamic countries, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, women may enjoy a fair amount of personal freedom in daily life, but female labor participation rates are low, independent living capacity is limited, and women’s status and autonomy are in fact inferior to those of Iranian women, who are broadly higher-educated and widely employed.

As for Iranian society as a whole, although freedom is indeed insufficient, it is not entirely absent, and in fact exceeds that of some other Middle Eastern countries and several authoritarian countries in the East. Although Iran’s religious authoritarianism is pronounced, compared with Sunni Islam, Shiite Islam in Iran has a stronger tendency toward reform and flexibility, and is more inclined to adapt to practical needs. It is therefore not as extreme or anti-human as stereotypes suggest. For example, Iran’s policies toward transgender individuals and toward ethnic and religious minorities are more enlightened than those of Sunni-dominated systems.

The author does not claim that Iran is highly democratic or highly free, nor that Shiism is particularly tolerant. It is clear that Iran lacks democracy and freedom, and Shiite clerical authoritarianism is certainly not inclusive. However, the degree to which a country is democratic or free should not be judged through simplistic binary thinking, but rather assessed based on facts to arrive at a balanced and appropriate conclusion.

Third, many people believe that Iran is a hegemonic power in the Middle East, an international rogue state that commits all kinds of evils, and that it even seeks to develop nuclear weapons. On this basis, they regard Iran as deeply evil and therefore deserving of attack and destruction.

In reality, however, over the past several decades Iran’s diplomatic and military behavior, compared with that of many other countries in the Middle East and the world, has not been notably in violation of international law or international norms. On the core issue at the center of diplomatic disputes—the Iranian nuclear issue—Iran did not violate the nuclear agreement it once reached with Western countries. After the 1979 revolution, because the Islamic regime opposed the United States while also refusing to align with the Soviet bloc, Eastern Europe, China, or India (as Khomeini put it: “Neither West nor East, only Islam”), and because it stood in opposition to Sunni forces that constitute the majority of the Muslim world, Iran became quite isolated internationally. This constrained its ability to project influence abroad and also forced it to be especially mindful of adhering to international rules, so as not to give hostile countries such as the United States and Israel an excuse to attack it. During the Khomeini era there was once talk of “exporting the revolution,” but this in effect soon ceased amid severe internal and external pressures.

Objectively, this has instead made Iran more self-restrained rather than a bully toward others. In the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War, Iran was the victim of aggression and the defensive side. Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, by contrast, was supported at the time by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and others in its invasion of Iran. In 1988, the U.S. military shot down an Iranian civilian airliner, killing 290 people (including 252 Iranian nationals), but because of Iran’s isolated position, the incident was never properly resolved. During the chaotic situation in Afghanistan in the 1990s, compared with Saudi Arabia and other countries that aggressively exported Wahhabi extremism, and Pakistan, which fostered the Taliban, Iran was relatively restrained—even after Iranian diplomats were massacred by the Taliban—and did not forcefully interfere in the internal affairs of this weaker neighboring country.

Some people compare attacks on Iran to the Allied campaign against Nazi Germany and Japan in World War II. This is clearly a false analogy. Over the past several decades, Iran has not launched wars of aggression against other countries, nor has it committed atrocities such as massacring millions of unarmed people of other ethnicities, or invading other countries and killing tens of millions of their soldiers and civilians. As for the threatening rhetoric by Iran’s theocratic rulers toward Israel, such as calls to “destroy Israel,” these have remained at the level of words and have not been put into practice. By contrast, it is Israel that has assassinated numerous Iranian scientists and military personnel.

As for the so-called “Shiite Crescent” formed by Iran together with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Alawite forces in Syria, pro-Iranian factions in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen, this bloc is a defensive alliance of weaker and minority forces, formed in response to Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Israel. Although the establishment and activities of the “Shiite Crescent” have indeed exacerbated instability in the Middle East, if the actions of all parties in the region and beyond are viewed in an even-handed manner, Iran’s and Shiite forces’ efforts at self-preservation and counteraction are understandable and should not be singled out for unilateral condemnation.

As for the Iranian nuclear issue, anyone who examines the negotiations between the United States and Iran prior to the Trump administration, as well as the relevant engagements by other Western countries and the United Nations, along with related media reports and analyses, can see that Iran had long agreed in negotiations to abandon the development of nuclear weapons and subsequently fulfilled this commitment, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. However, after Trump took office in 2017, he tore up the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, showing complete contempt for contractual commitments. This move also dealt a blow to Iran’s reformists, who favored peace and closer ties with the West, while empowering hardliners. The negotiation process over the nuclear agreement itself demonstrates that Iran was reasonable and acted in good faith. This stands in stark contrast to another nuclear-armed country, North Korea, which refused to honor its commitments under the Six-Party Talks, repeatedly conducted nuclear tests, and engaged in blackmail against all sides.

Fourth, many people believe that attacks on Iran by Israel and the United States can eliminate Iran’s clerical authoritarian forces, promote freedom and democracy in Iran, liberate the Iranian people, and free women from constraints.

This is in fact a case of Chinese liberals and Chinese-language internet users forcibly projecting some of their own perceptions and ambitions regarding China-related issues onto the Iranian issue, in order to vent their own emotions and demands, while disregarding the facts themselves.

The Netanyahu government in Israel and the Trump administration in the United States are both forces that strongly prioritize their own country and their own nation, place their own national interests above all else, are willing to harm the rights and even the lives of people in other countries, and do not hesitate to undermine international law. From their words, deeds, and the values they display, it is clear that they do not genuinely care about human rights, freedom, or democracy in Iran. Indeed, Netanyahu, Trump, and their supporters themselves are quite hostile to feminism, pluralistic democracy, and checks and balances of power, and they practice authoritarianism and suppress dissent at home.

When they speak of Iran’s authoritarian and corrupt regime and its oppression of the people, this is merely a pretext for attacking Iran and a means of sowing division among Iranians. They have not formulated any concrete or feasible plan to bring about regime change in Iran or a transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Nor have they shown respect or care for the Iranian state and people outside the regime. Instead, they simply hope to strike and weaken this hostile country, push it into deeper poverty and internal chaos, and do so at the cost of harming Iranian civilians and undermining Iran’s national interests and Persian national dignity. Although attacks and sanctions by Israel and the Trump administration have indeed, in objective terms, dealt blows to Iran’s clerical ruling group, the greater victims have been the Iranian state and people. Moreover, the clerical establishment can always select new figures to replace those eliminated; while their capabilities may be inferior to their predecessors, their rigidity and conservatism may well be even more severe than those who were “decapitated.”

Long-term sanctions and attacks on Iran by the United States and Israel have also produced the side effect of obstructing human rights progress, by giving Iran’s domestic hardliners both justification and momentum to close the country off from the outside world and intensify internal repression. Iran has elected several reformist presidents, such as Rouhani and Pezeshkian, all of whom clearly expressed a desire to improve relations with the United States and the West. Rouhani even conveyed a non-hostile attitude toward Israel, such as no longer denying the historical reality of the Holocaust and refraining from claims of destroying Israel. Iran is among the countries most suitable for “peaceful evolution.” Yet it was precisely Trump’s two terms in office, and the dominance of Republican hawks over foreign and military policy, that destroyed the possibility of promoting further Iranian openness and reform through peaceful and rational means, allowing conservatives to gain the upper hand and providing them with excuses to pursue rigidly conservative policies.

The economic stagnation, material shortages, popular impoverishment, and loss of national and civic dignity caused by sanctions, blockades, and military strikes imposed by the United States, Israel, and other countries hostile to Iran have also intensified internal contradictions and conflicts within Iran. Different groups and individuals inside Iran have become more prone to harming one another, and the ruling clerical forces have inflicted even harsher damage on the populace than when the external diplomatic environment was more favorable. The Iranian people thus suffer from a dual oppression: internal clerical authoritarianism and external imperial hegemony. They have not obtained freedom, democracy, or liberation, but instead have become poorer and more distressed.

Many Iranian opposition figures themselves have recognized these realities and, amid Israel’s recent large-scale attacks on Iran, have spoken out clearly against attacks by Israel and the Trump administration. For example, Iranian feminist activist Narges Mohammadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023; the long-imprisoned Iranian reformist politician Mostafa Tajzadeh; and Iranian scholar Sadegh Zibakalam, who has been imprisoned multiple times for opposing the government, have all explicitly opposed Israel’s attacks on Iran and argued that Israeli attacks and proposed U.S. participation in attacking Iran cannot bring freedom, liberation, or democracy to Iran. Only a small number of opposition figures, such as Reza Pahlavi, the son of the penultimate shah, support Israel’s attacks on Iran; the majority oppose them.

Of course, figures such as Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi have also criticized the performance of Iran’s theocratic regime during this Israel–Iran conflict, but their criticism targets the regime’s failure to protect the people and its allowing external enemies to exploit vulnerabilities. As Mohammadi stated, “For forty-six years, you have beaten the drums of war but built no shelters for the people, treating them as tools of propaganda. This must be overthrown.” They are not calling for the regime to surrender to Israel or the United States.

Iran certainly needs democracy, but not through the unreasonable methods employed by Israel and the Trump administration, such as tearing up the nuclear agreement without cause, launching violent attacks, or imposing comprehensive sanctions under a strategy of “maximum pressure.” Rather, there should be both pressure and engagement, linking sanctions to economic and trade relations as well as to human rights, supporting Iran’s progressive forces in initiating change, respecting the autonomy of the Iranian people, and gradually facilitating transformation.

Moreover, regardless of motivation, Israel’s attacks on Iran, as well as actions such as the Trump administration’s assassination of Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani, are all violations of international law, lack legitimate justification, seriously undermine international peace and the sovereignty of other countries, and are detrimental to humanitarian principles and human rights. If merely “feeling threatened” were sufficient justification to attack another country, then by the same logic Russia’s Putin regime attacking Ukraine would also become “legitimate.” If one supports Ukraine in opposing Russia while simultaneously supporting Israel’s attacks on Iran, this is clearly a double standard and forfeits moral credibility. Once such a precedent is set, more countries will claim the same justification to attack neighboring states or hostile countries, plunging the world into even greater warfare and chaos.

Fifth, quite a few Chinese opposition figures believe that Iran, together with China and Russia, forms an “evil axis” jointly confronting the West, and they further believe that Israel and the United States striking Iran can also strike and deter China and Russia. This misconception is even more detached from facts and farther from the truth than the previous ones.

Whether historically or today, Iran and China and Russia have never been especially close. Only in recent years, out of a shared need to counter the West, have they developed a loose cooperative relationship. The so-called “China–Russia–Iran iron triangle” is merely a far-fetched invention by some CCP online propagandists, some opposition figures, and various people with their own stances who do not understand the realities. For many years, Iran has faced attacks and sanctions from the United States and Israel, yet China and Russia have not provided Iran with any substantial or forceful support. At most, they import Iranian oil and occasionally conduct joint military exercises, but they have never directly provided military assistance or protection. Moreover, Iran often shows an inclination to cooperate with Europe, for example in oil development and infrastructure construction, and this is precisely one reason why China and Russia feel displeased with Iran. In addition, Iran has more actual democracy than China (see the first section of controversies), which is also an important reason why the CCP and Iran are not close, and why supporters of the Chinese government feel antipathy toward Iran.

After Israel attacked Iran in this round, China and Russia, beyond verbal condemnation of Israel and nominal support for Iran, have taken no substantive actions in political, military, or economic terms. Supporters of the Chinese government (the so-called “fifty-centers” and “little pinks”) have even mocked Iran’s weakness, mocked Iran for electing a reformist president friendly toward the West, and mocked Iran’s desire to improve relations with the West.

Even if Iran’s current regime were to collapse, it would not shake the CCP’s rule in China or Putin’s rule in Russia, just as the collapse of Saddam in Iraq and Gaddafi in Libya did not affect the CCP and China, or Putin and Russia. Although the collapse of Iran’s current regime would to some extent affect China’s influence in the Middle East, that impact would also be limited. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Qatar are even more important partners for China than Iran is, and they are also more stable and reliable, aligning with China’s pragmatic, economy-first, stability-first diplomatic stance. Moreover, if Iran’s current regime were overthrown and a new government emerged, Iran’s economic and trade cooperation with China would not necessarily decrease and might even increase (as seen after Saddam’s fall, when China entered Iraq’s oil market on a large scale once sanctions were lifted). And even if China’s influence in the Middle East were weakened, what would be harmed would only be China’s international competitiveness; it would not bring about freedom and democracy in China.

Furthermore, U.S. assistance to Israel in striking Iran does not mean the United States would similarly strike China and Russia. Trump striking Iran while continuing to be friendly toward Putin and Russia, and refusing to actively support Ukraine, is an example. And in China policy and the Taiwan issue, Trump would not treat the CCP’s China the way he treats Iran. China and Russia are both far stronger than Iran; their military strength, economic scale, and international influence are not comparable to Iran’s. They also have greater cooperative value for the United States and for the Trump administration. Trump also bullies the weak and fears the strong, so of course he would not treat China and Russia the same way—let alone launch military attacks on them.

Trump also admires strongman leaders such as Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, who put pragmatism above all else. He is unwilling even to attack and overthrow North Korea, let alone countries like China and Russia that are stronger and whose leaders suit his preferences even more. Trump and his aides attacking Iran instead reveals the ugly nature of “picking targets based on who they are” and striking especially hard at countries and forces that still seek reason, retain some ideals (even if they are irrational religious zeal), and carry some democratic color, while choosing to let truly evil dictators go free.

The above misconceptions and the author’s rebuttals are only part of the controversies involving Iran-related issues, and they are relatively brief analyses. Due to space constraints, the author will stop here. All of the above can also be verified through various channels, such as checking relevant reporting and investigation data.

The serious misconceptions that some Chinese people and Chinese-language users hold regarding Iran largely stem from forcibly projecting certain China-related frames onto the Iran issue, and then defining it through simplistic and unrealistic binaries such as “democracy versus authoritarianism” and “civilization destroying barbarism,” while making emotional and extreme comments that disregard the complexity of facts and the many-sided nature of the problems. This leads to distorted understanding of many basic facts about Iran, erroneous judgments, confused logic, and mistaken positions. (Moreover, China-related issues—especially China’s foreign-related issues—also cannot be reduced to a simple “democracy versus authoritarianism” or “civilization versus barbarism” dichotomy. One should not assume that U.S., European, or Japanese toughness toward China is goodwill, or that striking China will promote democracy. Issues of freedom and democracy are one matter, while issues of national and ethnic interests are another. Democratic countries are not necessarily kind or peaceful. On the contrary, because they may possess greater legitimacy and popular support, they can be even more aggressive than authoritarian states that prioritize internal stability. Europe and the United States may have somewhat more humanitarian sentiment, yet still place their own interests at the core. Japan and Israel are economically developed and provide good protections for their own citizens’ rights, but that does not mean they are benevolent toward foreigners; on the contrary, they often, for the sake of their own national and ethnic interests—many of which are unjust interests—commit more infringements against other countries and bully people of other ethnicities more.)

If one insists on pointing to similarities between China and Iran, there indeed are some: both countries occupy a marginal, relatively isolated position internationally; both face intense internal social contradictions; and external enemies, under the pretext of criticizing the regimes of China and Iran, are in fact harming the legitimate national and ethnic interests of both countries. The states and peoples of China and Iran suffer undeserved stigmatization and unfair treatment.

Because Iran has long been hostile to the West—especially the United States—and is also separated from and opposed to Sunni Islam, in a context where Western-led global public opinion and Sunni-led Muslim-world public opinion dominate, and because Iran is indeed authoritarian and has human-rights abuses, many negative aspects of Iran are amplified internationally while positive realities are ignored by mainstream discourse. This generates strong stereotypes among those with limited knowledge of Iran’s national conditions; what they know are partial facts. Many Chinese people, including liberals and opposition figures, both feel close to the West and lack sufficient information channels, and they also simplistically equate Iran with China. As a result, their aversion toward Iran becomes even stronger than that of others, they ignore complex realities, and they repeatedly make erroneous evaluations of Iran-related issues.

The author has no interest ties with Iran and obviously has no need to “whitewash” Iran. The reason the author seeks to clarify these issues is that sincere intellectuals and international observers, when faced with a chorus of uniform voices and a “one-sided” public opinion climate, should all the more pursue truth from facts, uphold objectivity, and promote balance—rather than embellish, follow the crowd, and add fuel to the fire. Moreover, whether in China’s domestic affairs, other countries’ affairs, or international issues, speaking up somewhat more for the weaker yet more reasonable side on the basis of facts, and applying more scrutiny and critique to the stronger yet unreasonable side, is precisely the stance and code of conduct that intellectuals, media workers, and people of conscience ought to uphold.

The author also hopes that people in China and around the world, regardless of their positions, should express their views and emotions on the premise of acknowledging basic facts, following logic, and offering reasoned arguments and evidence. Mistaken understandings, assumptions taken for granted, and wishful expectations will not bring about just and good outcomes.

( On the morning of September 28, 2023, I (Wang Qingmin (王庆民), a Chinese writer living in Europe) went to the Embassy of Iran in Germany. After taking a number and waiting in line, I handed my letter addressed to Iranian human rights protesters and those in power to a member of the Iranian staff.

I told the embassy staff that I hold rather friendly feelings toward Iran and do not wish to see the Iranian people killing one another. I hope that the Iranian government will end repression, achieve reconciliation and peace, protect human rights and improve people’s livelihoods domestically, and resist bullying by great powers externally, so that the Persian nation may be reshaped and reborn.

I have long felt sympathy and understanding toward Iran, especially toward the Persian nation. This is because its history, destiny, and present circumstances are similar to those of the Han Chinese in China. The Persian nation has a glorious history; later it was invaded by Islamic forces, converted to Shiism, and has long been besieged by Sunnis. After the 1979 Revolution, it has faced attacks and sanctions from various forces such as the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel.

Although Iran does indeed have serious human rights problems, this is not a justification for outsiders to bully it at will, and such attacks cannot improve Iran’s human rights situation.
The past several years, I have written many articles commenting on Iranian issues, and the year before last I also went to the Iranian embassy to deliver letters. My writings include A Century of Historical Change in Iran and the Turbulent Fate of Women（《伊朗百年历史变迁与女性命运的跌宕》）, Ode to Iranian Women (a poem)（《伊朗妇女颂》）, Iran amid Domestic Protests and External Attack Risks: Rethinking International Intervention（《伊朗内外交困与外部干预的复杂性》）, Several Controversies and Misconceptions in Chinese Public Opinion on the Iran Issue（《中文舆论对伊朗问题的若干争议和误区》）, Saudi–Iran Rapprochement: A Marriage of Convenience under Long-Term Rivalry（《沙特伊朗复交：两国长期争霸下的权宜之计》）, The Background of Israel’s Large-Scale Attacks on Iran and the Disappearance of Compromise and Peace in the Middle East（《以色列大举袭击伊朗的背景与中东妥协和平的消失》）, The 2024 Iranian Presidential Election: A Dull Contest between Conservatives and Reformists amid Internal and External Crises（《2024年伊朗总统选举：内忧外患下保守派与改革派的沉闷竞争》）, as well as this letter addressed to Iran’s rulers, opposition forces, and all sectors of society.

Regarding the protests in Iran in December 2025, I support the Iranian people in their pursuit of freedom, democracy, and improved livelihoods, while also opposing bullying and sanctions against Iran by the U.S. Republican Party and Israel. The international community should treat Iran and its people with sincerity and respect, and should distinguish dictators from the country and its people. It is even more necessary to oppose the United States and Israel exploiting the banner of freedom and democracy to take advantage of turmoil and practice hegemonism.)

"Asking Grok, Are people cancelling their World Cup 2026 tickets because of ICE activity?",1q9ra8m,1,0,2026-01-11 05:42:56,New-Biscotti-9155,boycottworldCup26,"Yes, there are reports and growing calls indicating that some people—primarily \*\*international fans\*\* and at least one high-profile individual—are cancelling their \*\*FIFA World Cup 2026\*\* tickets due to concerns over \*\*U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\*\* activities and broader safety fears related to immigration enforcement under the current administration.

This stems from a recent high-profile incident: On January 7, 2026, an \*\*ICE agent\*\* fatally shot a woman named Renee Good during a migration operation in Minneapolis. This event has sparked widespread outrage, protests, and renewed criticism of aggressive immigration policies, including fears of arbitrary detentions, lack of due process, or even violence toward visitors perceived as ""foreign"" or from certain backgrounds.

Key examples include:

\- \*\*Mohamad Safa\*\*, a Lebanese diplomat and executive director of a UN-accredited NGO, publicly announced on X (formerly Twitter) that he cancelled his tickets, stating: ""The ICE may decide that I am a gang member, and I'll be locked in prison for a year with no charges, no hearing, no trial, no right to consult a lawyer, no phone call. The US is not safe to visit.""

\- Media outlets (such as AS USA, IndiaTimes, LatestLY, and Newsweek) report that \*\*thousands\*\* of overseas fans have cancelled tickets or travel plans, with figures cited ranging from \*\*over 10,000\*\* to as high as \*\*16,800\*\* or \*\*25,000+\*\* in the days following the shooting. These cancellations are attributed to fears of a ""climate of fear,"" potential racial profiling, detentions, or risks during travel to the U.S. for the tournament (co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in summer 2026).

\- Social media posts and calls for boycotts have amplified the issue, with users urging others to ""cancel your tickets"" and avoid the U.S. portion of the event due to perceived dangers from ICE enforcement.

These developments are tied to broader tensions, including the Trump administration's immigration crackdown (ongoing since early 2025), threats related to Mexico (a co-host), and human rights concerns raised by groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International about U.S. detention practices.

However, official FIFA sources show no mention of widespread cancellations impacting overall sales. Ticket demand remains extraordinarily high, with over \*\*150 million\*\* requests in recent phases and new low-price tiers (e.g., $60 ""Supporter Entry"" tickets) introduced. The tournament is still on track, with ongoing sales phases.

In summary, while the scale may be limited relative to total demand (millions of tickets expected), a notable wave of cancellations and boycott sentiment has emerged specifically linked to ICE-related fears and the Minneapolis incident. This is a fast-moving story from early January 2026, so the numbers could evolve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/boycottworldCup26/comments/1q9ra8m/asking_grok_are_people_cancelling_their_world_cup/
"Why I Find It Hard to Believe in God, Personally",1q9g5o7,10,8,2026-01-10 21:25:03,ambay13,atheism,"Even if we grant the assumption that God exists, it does not follow that any particular religion is true. The existence of a god and the correctness of a specific religious doctrine are entirely different claims. When we look at religion not through faith but through probability, history, and human disagreement, a striking conclusion emerges. The chance that any one person has chosen the correct religion is extremely small.

Across our history, there have been thousands of religions, estimates range from roughly 4,000 to over 10,000, depending on how one counts sects and traditions. Within the major religions themselves, fragmentation is immense. Christianity alone contains hundreds of denominations. Islam has dozens of sects. Hinduism has thousands of philosophical and theological schools. These are not minor variations. They make mutually exclusive claims about who God is, what God wants, how salvation works, and what happens after death. They cannot all be correct. In fact, most of them must be wrong.

Yet nearly every believer is convinced they belong to the one correct tradition. This means that choosing a religion is effectively like being handed a single lottery ticket out of thousands, and almost everyone believes theirs is the winning one. From a statistical standpoint, this is deeply implausible.

This becomes even more troubling when we examine how people acquire their beliefs. If religious truth were real, objective, and discoverable in the way mathematics or medicine is, we would expect people around the world to converge on it over time. Instead, we observe the opposite. Religious belief tracks geography almost perfectly. A person born in Saudi Arabia is overwhelmingly likely to be Muslim. Someone born in India is likely Hindu. In Italy, Catholic. In Thailand, Buddhist. In Utah, Mormon. A person’s religion, and therefore their supposed eternal fate, is determined not by investigation or evidence, but by where they happened to be born.

This alone reveals that religious belief is primarily cultural inheritance, not truth detection. If salvation or eternal punishment depends on accepting the correct doctrine, then the universe operates in a way that is radically unfair. Billions of people are placed at a permanent disadvantage by sheer accident of birth. That directly violates any coherent notion of justice or moral consequence.

Even if we assume that one religion out of all those that have ever existed is correct, the numbers are devastating. If five thousand religions have existed, then 99.98 percent of all believers in history were wrong. Yet those people were just as sincere, devoted, and confident as modern believers. When someone today says, I know my religion is true, they are statistically indistinguishable from the billions of people who were wrong before them. Confidence does not correlate with correctness.

The situation is even worse when we consider internal religious conflict. Christianity alone is split into Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox who historically condemned each other. Within Protestantism there are Calvinists and Arminians who disagree on salvation. There are Trinitarians and non Trinitarians who do not even agree on the nature of God. These are not small disputes. They concern the core of the faith. If one version is right, the others must be wrong. So the odds are not one in a few thousand. They are one in tens of thousands.

All of this leads to a conclusion. Even if God exists, religious certainty is irrational. The most honest position is not that one specific tradition has discovered cosmic truth, but that humans, limited, culturally shaped, and historically divided, almost certainly have not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1q9g5o7/why_i_find_it_hard_to_believe_in_god_personally/

(RECAP) Trump's Actions in Venezuela were ILLEGAL!!! | Lichtman Live #194,1q98c0e,1,0,2026-01-10 16:24:45,PrivateFM,13KeysToTheWhiteHouse,"**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/live/EpDZ6MXX-5g](https://www.youtube.com/live/EpDZ6MXX-5g)

*\*If you find any inaccuracies in this summary, please don't hesitate to let me know and I'll make the necessary corrections accordingly.*

**Discussion**

* Professor Lichtman opened the stream on the fifth anniversary of the January 6th Capitol attacks by highlighting the explosive recent testimony of Special Counsel Jack Smith, who appeared before Congress on New Year's Eve. Smith’s testimony confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results and prevent the peaceful transfer of power. Lichtman argued that Trump is actively attempting to rewrite this history, transforming a violent insurrection into a patriotic event by pardoning rioters under the false pretense that they were denied due process. The Professor drew a sharp parallel between these pardons and Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, a figure Lichtman identified as one of history's most notorious drug traffickers. Hernández had been convicted in US federal court for facilitating the importation of over 400 tons of cocaine into the United States, utilizing the Honduran military and police force to protect drug shipments. Lichtman emphasized that, contrary to Trump’s claims of unfair treatment, Hernández had received full due process during his prosecution, making his pardon a blatant act of rewriting history to justify criminal behavior.
* The conversation shifted to the Trump administration's declaration that it is now running Venezuela, a claim Lichtman dismantled by pointing out that Maduro's vice president was recently sworn in alongside delegations from American adversaries like Iran, Russia, and China. Lichtman condemned the administration's labeling of this intervention as a military operation and law enforcement mission, asserting these actions are illegal, immoral, and historically illiterate. He provided a detailed historical critique of US interventions, noting that toppling dictators often leads to worse outcomes, such as the power vacuum following Saddam Hussein's removal in Iraq, the chaos after Muammar Gaddafi's fall in Libya, and the rise of the brutal Pinochet dictatorship in Chile after the US-backed coup against the democratically elected Salvador Allende. He also referenced the 1954 US intervention in Guatemala, which overthrew the democratically elected government of Jacobo Árbenz and ultimately led to a decades-long civil war and the Silent Holocaust, a genocide against the Mayan people. Lichtman warned that the current resource extraction operation in Venezuela lacks any plan for governance and is purely motivated by oil interests.
* Lichtman and Sam discussed the administration's failure to secure international support for the Venezuela operation, noting that the United Nations Security Council and key NATO allies like Spain, France, and Denmark have openly condemned or refused to support the move. The Professor compared the administration's military operation rhetoric to Vladimir Putin’s use of terms like ""special military operation"" to justify the invasion of Ukraine, arguing that bombing a country and removing its leader constitutes an act of war regardless of the terminology used. They also highlighted the logistical absurdity of the operation, observing that major oil companies are reluctant to invest in Venezuela due to the political instability, prompting Trump to suggest using taxpayer money to subsidize these corporations—a move Lichtman contrasted with the administration's simultaneous cuts to social safety nets like Medicaid and food stamps.
* The discussion expanded to the administration's aggressive foreign policy rhetoric regarding Greenland, specifically Stephen Miller's assertion that the United States has a claim to the territory equal to that of Denmark. Lichtman refuted this by outlining Greenland's political evolution from a Danish colony in the 18th century to its integration into the Danish realm in 1953, the granting of home rule in 1979, and its achievement of self-government in 2009. He argued that Trump is misapplying the Monroe Doctrine—which was originally designed to prevent European colonization in the Western Hemisphere—to justify a new doctrine that essentially claims the US can seize territory at will. Lichtman warned that threatening a NATO ally like Denmark with a military takeover could shatter the alliance, as Article 5 of the NATO charter stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all.
* Lichtman analyzed the sudden withdrawal of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz from his gubernatorial reelection campaign, a move driven by Republicans effectively tying his administration to the Feeding Our Future scandal, a massive scheme involving the misappropriation of federal food aid intended for children. Lichtman noted that the Trump administration is using this controversy as a pretext to freeze ten billion dollars in social service funding for five Democratic-led states. The Professor further argued that this crackdown is specifically designed to target the Somali community in Minnesota, contrasting this aggressive enforcement with President Trump's history of pardoning white criminals who have committed similar financial crimes, thus exposing a racially biased double standard in the administration's application of justice.
* Lichtman criticized the Pentagon's newly announced review of the effectiveness of women in ground combat roles, characterizing it not as a good-faith inquiry but as a smokescreen orchestrated by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ultimately remove women from these positions. The Professor pointed to Hegseth's past record of explicitly stating women should not serve in combat and highlighted the hypocrisy of the administration threatening Senator Mark Kelly’s military rank and pension for reminding troops they are not required to follow illegal orders—a stance Hegseth himself had publicly supported in 2016.
* Finally, the Professor expressed deep frustration with the Department of Justice's failure to meet the deadline for releasing the Epstein files, noting that less than one percent of the documents have been produced despite previous claims that they were ready for release. Lichtman accused the administration of a combination of laziness, stupidity, and malice, pointing out the contradiction in Attorney General Pam Bondi’s earlier assertion that the files were on her desk versus her later claim that they did not exist, suggesting a deliberate effort to bury the information to protect political allies while exclusively investigating Democrats.

**Q&A Highlights**

**1. Explanation of BRICS and Its Relation to the Capture of Maduro:**  
Professor Lichtman described BRICS as an alliance of nations that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. He explained that these nations have been highly critical of the Trump administration's intervention in Venezuela and suggested that the operation against Maduro is part of a wider effort to destabilize this bloc of nations, pointing to the administration's other attempts to exclude South Africa from international meetings and its military aggressions against Iran. He characterized this foreign policy as a kind of low-budget version of the axis of evil, aimed at undermining any country that challenges American dominance.

**2. Possibility of Future Military Moves Against Colombia, Cuba, and Greenland:**  
Professor Lichtman warned that the military operation in Venezuela is likely not a one-time event but rather the beginning of a broader policy of aggression. He cited rhetoric from both Donald Trump and senior advisor Stephen Miller indicating potential actions against other nations, including Colombia, Cuba, and even Greenland. Lichtman described this approach as a smash and grab strategy focused on resource seizure and projecting power. While he noted it is impossible to know if these threats will materialize, he stressed that the administration's stated intentions suggest further military interventions are a real possibility.

**3. Comparison of US Monetary Aid in Iraq to Venezuela and Oil Company Investment:**  
Professor Lichtman affirmed the parallel between the potential situation in Venezuela and the aftermath of the Iraq War, where the US spent vast sums to stabilize a deteriorating society. He expressed strong doubts that major oil companies would willingly invest in rebuilding Venezuela's infrastructure, given that corporations prioritize stability and certainty above all else. Lichtman highlighted the profound hypocrisy of the administration proposing to use American taxpayer money to subsidize some of the world's richest corporations while simultaneously cutting essential domestic programs like Medicaid and food stamps. He concluded that it is unlikely even the current Republican-controlled House would approve such funding, and it would have zero chance if Democrats regain control.

**4. Impact of Educating the Public on the Draft and Its Potential Reinstatement:**  
Professor Lichtman stated he would be profoundly shocked if the military draft were to be reinstated. He explained that the draft, which has not been used since the Nixon administration ended it in 1973, is now considered politically toxic. While he acknowledged from his personal experience of being drafted during the Vietnam War that conscription can powerfully galvanize anti-war movements, he argued that the immense political backlash any modern president or Congress would face makes its return almost unimaginable.

**5. Venezuelan Action Signifying Peak Oil and the Logic of Invasion:**  
Professor Lichtman firmly rejected the idea that invading Venezuela signals that the world is running out of oil. He pointed out that the United States is a net exporter of oil and has no desperate need for Venezuela's specific type of heavy crude. He argued that the administration's true motivation is its commitment to expanding the use of fossil fuels, in direct defiance of overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. Lichtman cited the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as bomb cyclones and massive wildfires, as proof that the planet is nearing a tipping point, making the administration's actions a dangerous pursuit of plunder.

**6. Parallels Between Stephen Miller Running Venezuela and Paul Bremer in Iraq:**  
Professor Lichtman fully endorsed the comparison between Stephen Miller potentially governing Venezuela and L. Paul Bremer's disastrous administration of post-invasion Iraq. He called the notion of placing an incompetent and immoral figure like Miller in charge of a nation of nearly 30 million people a recipe for catastrophe. Lichtman explained that Bremer's key decisions in Iraq, such as disbanding the Iraqi army and purging Ba'ath party members from government, directly fueled the insurgency and chaos that followed. He held up this history as a critical cautionary tale that the current administration is foolishly ignoring.

**7. Strategies for Legitimate Political Opposition and the Demonization of Progressives:**  
Professor Lichtman advised Democrats to study Harry Truman’s successful 1948 presidential campaign as a model for combating accusations of socialism. He detailed how Truman, despite being written off by pundits and attacked as a leftist, embarked on a nationwide grassroots whistle-stop train tour. On this tour, Truman directly attacked the unproductive do-nothing Congress and passionately advocated for progressive policies like national health reform, affordable housing, and civil rights. Lichtman urged today's Democrats to stop being defensive and instead proudly campaign on their historic achievements, such as Social Security and the Affordable Care Act.

**8. Comparing Trump’s Actions to Andrew Jackson’s Trail of Tears and Polk’s Manifest Destiny:**  
Professor Lichtman agreed that Trump’s actions are on a similar moral level as some of the darkest chapters in American history. He specifically compared them to Andrew Jackson’s forced removal of Native Americans on the Trail of Tears and James K. Polk’s instigation of the Mexican-American War. However, Lichtman drew a crucial distinction: while Polk's war, though racist and aggressive, resulted in a massive expansion of US territory, including California and the Southwest, Trump's actions offer no such strategic or tangible benefit to the country. They are purely destructive, creating chaos with no positive outcome.

**9. Democratic Failure to Highlight Student Loan Garnishments:**  
Professor Lichtman concurred that Democrats should be making the issue of student loan garnishments a major focus. He framed the administration's policy as a punitive attack on ordinary Americans who sought to better themselves through education, many of whom were victims of predatory for-profit colleges. He contrasted this harsh stance against student borrowers with the administration's willingness to provide enormous financial benefits and tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations, arguing this stark hypocrisy is a powerful political issue that Democrats are failing to exploit.

**10. Likelihood of a Coalition Imposing Sanctions on the US and Global Economic Impact:**  
Professor Lichtman explained that a broad international coalition is highly unlikely to impose sanctions on the United States, despite global outrage at its actions. The reason, he stated, is that the US economy is the largest and most central to the global financial system. He argued that any attempt to sanction the United States would trigger a devastating worldwide economic collapse. This reality serves as a powerful deterrent, forcing even the most critical allies to moderate their responses and avoid direct economic confrontation.

**11. Odds of Trump Remaining in Power Until the End of His Term Amidst Scandals:**  
Professor Lichtman suggested that Trump’s hold on power is showing signs of weakening. He pointed to polling on the Venezuela intervention, which has less than 40 percent support and has failed to produce the expected rally-around-the-flag effect seen in past military conflicts. He believes that while a politically motivated removal from office is improbable because the Senate would never convict him, the most significant threat to Trump serving his full term is his personal health.

**12. Historical View of Trump’s Reelection After January 6th and Comparable Controversies:**  
Professor Lichtman asserted that there is no historical precedent for a US president being reelected after a controversy on the scale of January 6th. He reviewed major presidential scandals like the Teapot Dome scandal and Watergate, noting a consistent pattern: these events either occurred during a president's second term or led directly to their resignation or decision not to seek reelection. He concluded that Trump’s political survival and return to power after inciting an insurrection is a unique event in American history, making its long-term perception difficult to predict.

**13. Psychology Behind the Republican Obsession with Conspiracy Theories:**  
Professor Lichtman, while clarifying he is not a psychologist, explained that conspiracy theories are appealing because they offer simple explanations for complex problems and consistently blame an external group or other. This allows believers to avoid self-reflection or responsibility. He noted that these theories frequently target groups like immigrants, feminists, and Jews. To illustrate the mindset, he told a joke from the Weimar Republic about a rabbi who preferred reading a Nazi newspaper because, unlike the Jewish press which detailed persecution, the Nazi paper claimed Jews secretly controlled the world, offering a perverse sense of power.

**14. Consequences if the Supreme Court Guts the Voting Rights Act:**  
Professor Lichtman described a potential Supreme Court decision to gut the Voting Rights Act as a body blow to American democracy. He reminded the audience that President Ronald Reagan called the Act the crown jewel of American law because it finally dismantled the Jim Crow systems that had disenfranchised Black voters for a century. Lichtman warned that nullifying this law would be a tragic step backward, reopening the door to discriminatory voting practices and severely damaging the principle of one person, one vote.

**15. Congressional Actions to Prevent Another Insurrection:**  
Professor Lichtman stated that the current Republican-controlled Congress is doing nothing to prevent a future insurrection, largely because its members have embraced the false narrative that January 6th was a patriotic protest. He did, however, credit the previous Congress with taking a meaningful step by passing the Electoral Count Reform Act. He explained that this law clarified that the Vice President's role in counting electoral votes is purely ceremonial and significantly raised the threshold for members of Congress to object to a state's certified results, thereby strengthening the process against future attempts at subversion.

**16. Potential Coverage of the 2026 Quebec Election:**  
In response to a viewer's question, Professor Lichtman expressed interest in potentially covering the 2026 Quebec election. He mentioned his fondness for Quebec from his travels there and said that, having been alerted to the upcoming election, he would keep it on his radar and possibly discuss it as it draws closer.

**17. California Voting to Join Denmark and European Fear of Trump:**  
Professor Lichtman used a viewer's satirical question about California joining Denmark to address the genuine and profound fear among European allies regarding the Trump administration. He explained that the threat to take over Greenland has created an unprecedented rift within NATO. If the US were to act, it could theoretically trigger Article 5 of the NATO charter, placing member nations in the impossible position of having to defend Denmark, a fellow member, against the United States, the leader of the alliance. This potential for the complete collapse of the Western security alliance is a source of terror in European capitals.

**18. Role of Hugo Chavez Versus Maduro in Venezuela’s Economic Collapse:**  
Professor Lichtman laid the blame for Venezuela's economic ruin on both Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro. He explained that Chavez initiated the country's decline with policies that weakened the vital oil industry and eroded democratic institutions. Maduro, he continued, then took a bad situation and made it catastrophically worse, accelerating the economic mismanagement and intensifying the authoritarian crackdown into a full-blown dictatorship.

**19. Public Support for Regime Change Compared to the Truman Presidency:**

Professor Lichtman stated unequivocally that American public opinion no longer supports the kind of interventionist regime-change policies that were common during the early Cold War. He used polling data showing that over 70 percent of Americans oppose the US taking over the governance of Venezuela as concrete proof of this shift. He contrasted this modern sentiment with the broad support President Truman received for his policies of containing communism, highlighting how much the public's appetite for foreign intervention has diminished.

**20. Viability of Venezuelan Oil and Trump as a Power Bully:**  
Professor Lichtman confirmed that Venezuelan oil presents significant logistical challenges, as it is a heavy crude that is difficult to extract and requires specialized refineries. He also referenced expert opinions that it could take anywhere from two to ten years to restore its production. For these reasons, he agreed with the analysis that the intervention is less about a practical plan to secure oil and more about Donald Trump acting as a power bully on the world stage. He concluded that the entire operation has the hallmarks of a Wag the Dog scenario: a manufactured foreign crisis intended to distract voters from pressing domestic issues like the struggling job market and rising healthcare premiums.

**Conclusion**

Professor Lichtman concluded the livestream by urging viewers to remain vigilant. He framed the current period of unprecedented political chaos and international aggression not as a peak, but as the very start of a new, turbulent era, advising viewers that what we are witnessing is merely the beginning of the beginning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/13KeysToTheWhiteHouse/comments/1q98c0e/recap_trumps_actions_in_venezuela_were_illegal/

Intersectionality - explaining why so many white men like Jonathan Ross are married to Asian women,1q93c2z,353,83,2026-01-10 12:53:53,dobio,TrueAnon,"Let’s take the Phillipines as an example. Colonised by Spain for 300 years, and then colonised by USA for 50 years. Their labour is exploited and their wealth is extracted via imperialism. In order to sustain imperialism without protest back home, it’s important to sell the idea to your own citizens in USA/CANZUK that they’re superior and the people you’re exploiting/oppressing (Filipinos in this case) are subhuman. Next, if you feed Filipinos propaganda that they are ugly for 350 years, they’ll start to believe it. Tell them their noses are flat and their eyes are too small and that their skin is too dark. Make half white/Filipino people over-represented in media (e.g miss universe). Prey on these insecurities by pushing plastic surgery like rhinoplasty, double eyelid surgery, and skin whitening products.  Hypersexualise the women and emasculate the men. Tell them meritocracy is real, and that they’re poor because they’re not trying hard enough. Sell them a promise of a better future if they immigrate abroad to wealthier countries like USA. Tell them that if you marry a white person, they’ll have a beautiful halfie child with a tall nose and pale skin and big eyes. Now the new Filipino immigrants will proclaim how proud they are to be American and have escaped their poor motherland. Now the cycle of self-hate is complete.

Combine this with a subsection of white men who 1.) believe the propaganda that they’re exceptional by virtue of being American/white 2.) are awkward with poor social skills and poor dating history 3.) happy with an uneven power differential in the relationship 4.) questionably racist or unaware of racial dynamics (usually self-proclaim they don’t see colour) 5. Potentially aware of the above racial dynamics, and are happy to exploit them

You’ll see the same examples play out in other colonies - e.g Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.

This self-hate is the same reason you’ll see a Filipino open up an ancestry test and get disappointed they didn’t have any Spanish blood in them.

Interesting example - Derek Chauvin’s wife is also Asian.

And there you have it, the recipe for white worship, self-hate, and why you see so many White men like Jonathon Ross are married to Asian women. **And capitalism/imperialism is ultimately the root of all of this.**

Why India can’t get freedom of speech like USA?,1q921lq,0,19,2026-01-10 11:42:15,squinty_breaks,AskIndia,"We all know that the freedom of speech, although a fundamental right in India is quite different in practice. You can very easily get arrested/thrashed/killed if you say something that doesn’t suite the administration.

I have stayed in US for a few months, and I have seen a lot of protests, podcasts, celebrities and even normal public saying not so good things about the government. I have seen them cursing and even demeaning the administration (including their president) also. But the consequences of doing that there are far less severe than here in India.

Now, one thing that I find different in India compared to other developed nations, is that people in India are very easily influenced and manipulated and we have a ton of people who are just jobless so they get on to anything as it gives their life some purpose. While people in other developed nations, take their own time to analyse things and the react.

Indian Flags should be mandatory.,1q919e7,1,0,2026-01-10 10:55:52,upForIndia,youthforIndia,"I believe that everything on Indian land—be it schools, religious institutions, public vehicles, private vehicles, private institutions, grounds, party offices, cafés, clubs, or any public or social gathering place—must either hoist the Indian flag or display it in a framed and clearly visible manner. One may collectively hoist the flag or display it individually, but acknowledgment of the land on which one stands must be non-negotiable.

This principle should extend to all forms of social gatherings, whether peaceful protests, rallies, roadshows, or festival celebrations. Any such gathering should have a clearly visible Indian flag, with limited exceptions permitted only through official police authorization or for specific rituals such as mourning.

The flags should be governed, standardized, and officially provided or approved by the Government of India, along with clear policies to ensure respectful handling. The government should define minimum frame and flag dimensions. While individuals or institutions may choose larger sizes, any distortion, alteration, or modification of the flag must not be tolerated.

These flags can be distributed through local government offices and manufactured in India by Indian craftsmen, thereby reinforcing both national respect and local employment.

The government should impose strict legal consequences on anyone who deliberately defies this mandate, as such refusal would amount to a denial of acknowledgment of the nation and could promote anti-national sentiment.

At the same time, the law must explicitly state that citizens who observe violations should report them only to the police or through designated digital platforms. No form of mob action or vigilantism must be permitted. Strict action should be taken against any mob violence or misuse of this mandate as a weapon against others. If enforcement creates fear among citizens, then the system itself has failed.

This proposal is not about coercion or hostility, but about collective acknowledgment of the nation we inhabit.

No freedom of speech (samay raina /bajrang dal)

And then the biggest similarity both b j p and republican party are far rights 

To sum it up i don’t believe ind is a democracy anymore because the government is majorly dominated by one ruling party who doesn’t grant its citizens  basic human rights

Mark Morrison: The Architect of Resilient Systems,1q9tetn,1,0,2026-01-11 07:43:34,nikhilpotdar,Fulcrafall,"# Basic Information

* **Full Name:** Mark Alan Morrison
* **Born:** 1991
* **Died:** 206x (natural causes; respiratory failure)
* **Nationality:** American-Serkovian dual citizenship
* **Education:** Chemical Engineering, Systems Physics
* **Affiliation:** Founder & First CEO, Fulchron Sciences

Mark Alan Morrison, Founder of Fulchron Sciences, was widely regarded as one of the most influential scientific and industrial thinkers of his generation. To the public, he was the quiet counterweight to flashy technocrats: measured, articulate, and relentlessly pragmatic. He avoided celebrity, rarely appeared in interviews, and resisted mythmaking around his own persona.

After his death, Morrison was often described as:

*“The man who taught industry how to fail without collapsing.”*

*“The last systems engineer who still believed responsibility mattered.”*

# Early Life and Background

Mark Morrison was born in 1991 to an American family with professional ties to Eastern Europe. His early exposure to post-industrial Serkovia, an isolated, mountainous republic with ageing infrastructure and complex geopolitical pressures, deeply influenced his thinking about systems, failure, and long-term stability.

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Morrison was not drawn to software-first innovation or financial engineering. His academic focus lay at the intersection of chemical engineering, systems physics, and failure analysis, disciplines concerned less with optimisation and more with boundary conditions, stress behaviour, and unintended consequences. From early in his career, Morrison displayed skepticism toward high-speed technological adoption. He was particularly critical of what he later described as *“efficiency absolutism”* the belief that faster, leaner, and cheaper systems were inherently superior.

# Personality and Philosophy

Morrison was known for a reserved and observant temperament, marked by dry humour and a measured presence rather than overt charisma. His leadership style was delegative and principle-first, shaped by a deep resistance to hype and performative innovation. He believed that intelligence without limits was inherently dangerous, and while he was deeply pro-science, he remained openly critical of optimisation culture and the assumption that increasingly complex or “smarter” systems were automatically safer. Internally, he was known for distilling this scepticism into a simple test:

*“If you can’t explain how it fails, you don’t understand how it works.”*

Morrison’s philosophy was shaped by systems theory, historical collapse, and lived experience rather than abstract idealism. He believed that efficiency amplifies fragility, that progress without accountability accelerates harm, and that systems must be designed to absorb error rather than erase it. His worldview emphasised restraint as a form of responsibility, not limitation. This outlook was most clearly captured in his defining maxim:

*“Be purposeful, or be grateful. Everything else will kill you.”* To Morrison, purpose justified risk, gratitude constrained arrogance, and success without either became corrosive over time.

# Founding of Fulchron Sciences

Morrison founded Fulchron Sciences in response to what he perceived as a growing disconnect between technological capability and systemic responsibility, though Fulchron was not originally conceived as a scientific research company. At its inception, Fulchron was established as a systems governance and infrastructure reliability organisation, formed by Morrison alongside a small group of co-founders drawn from engineering, network architecture, and institutional risk analysis. Their shared concern was not innovation for its own sake, but the absence of oversight structures capable of understanding how complex systems failed at scale.

Fulchron’s first major success came in the field of telecommunications, where the company developed the CORVEX network, a resilient, self-correcting communications architecture designed to maintain partial operability under extreme stress. Unlike conventional networks optimized for peak performance, CORVEX emphasized compartmentalization, fault isolation, and graceful degradation. Its successful deployment demonstrated that large-scale systems could be designed to fail incrementally rather than collapse outright, establishing Fulchron’s credibility and defining its early identity.

Following CORVEX, Fulchron’s remit gradually expanded beyond governance and network architecture into materials science, energy infrastructure, transport logistics, and containment systems. This expansion was not driven by a shift in philosophy, but by the recognition that systemic failure rarely respects disciplinary boundaries. Under Morrison’s leadership, Fulchron applied the same resilience-first framework across these domains, frequently delaying, scaling back, or cancelling projects when failure behaviour could not be adequately modelled. While this approach earned the company a reputation for being conservative, slow-moving, and expensive, it also positioned Fulchron as unusually reliable in high-risk environments where failure carried cascading consequences.

# Leadership Style and Philosophy

Morrison’s leadership style was defined by restraint rather than charisma. He delegated operational authority readily but retained firm control over system boundaries, risk thresholds, and failure assumptions. Personally reserved and known for dry humor, Morrison avoided public visibility and resisted being portrayed as a visionary figure. Internally, he was known for halting projects not because they failed testing, but because they succeeded without adequately revealing how they might fail. He believed that systems which could not clearly articulate their breaking points were inherently dangerous.

# The Velthrite Era

Morrison played a central role in the discovery and early industrial deployment of Velthrite, a mineral extracted from Serkovian permafrost that exhibited extraordinary thermal and energetic properties. Velthrite appeared capable of stabilising combustion, absorbing extreme thermal stress, and behaving predictably under high-load conditions. These properties led to rapid adoption across fuel transport systems, aerospace shielding, electrical grid failsafes, and high-density infrastructure. Initially, Velthrite was celebrated as a stabilising force in an increasingly fragile technological world. However, an unanticipated interaction between trace Velthrite contamination and hydrocarbon fuels triggered widespread systemic failures. These failures cascaded through transport, energy, and financial systems, resulting in global economic disruption comparable to early 21st-century financial crises.

# Response and Accountability

Morrison’s response to the Velthrite collapse sharply distinguished him from many of his contemporaries. Rather than externalising blame to regulators, partners, or downstream implementers, he publicly acknowledged Fulchron’s role in failing to anticipate secondary and tertiary interactions at scale. Morrison framed Velthrite not as an isolated technical error, but as a failure of assumptions, specifically, the belief that stabilising one system could not destabilise others. In the aftermath, Fulchron abandoned further miracle-material initiatives and redirected resources toward adaptive systems and stress-learning frameworks. Deployment timelines were extended, safeguards strengthened, and growth deliberately slowed. Internally, this period became known as The Long Stabilisation.

# The Founder’s Doctrine

Following the Velthrite collapse, Morrison formalised a set of guiding principles that came to be known as **The Founder’s Doctrine**. These principles emphasised designing systems for failure rather than perfection, treating efficiency as a risk multiplier rather than an inherent virtue, preserving human judgment within automated systems, scaling deliberately or not at all, and accepting responsibility beyond personal tenure. Morrison viewed these principles not as rigid policy but as moral constraints that required constant reinforcement. His most enduring maxim, *“Be purposeful, or be grateful. Everything else will kill you,”* encapsulated his belief that unchecked ambition and unexamined success inevitably lead to catastrophe.

# Later Years and Death

In the final years of his life, Morrison gradually withdrew from operational leadership at Fulchron. Although he remained influential in an advisory capacity, his ability to enforce restraint diminished as external pressures increased from investors, defence partners, and geopolitical stakeholders. Fulchron’s core architectural frameworks remained intact, but the cultural patience required to respect their limitations steadily eroded. Morrison’s health deteriorated over this period due to the progressive aggravation of a chronic respiratory condition, and he died in 206x in his seventies from respiratory failure. While his death did not immediately result in structural changes within Fulchron, internal accounts suggest it removed the final philosophical barrier to accelerating efficiency-driven governance.

# Legacy

Mark Morrison’s greatest contribution was not a specific technology or discovery, but a constraint, the insistence that power must be limited by foresight, humility, and accountability. He never married and died without descendants, leaving no personal lineage to carry his name or defend his intentions. As Fulchron continues to operate without its founder, Morrison’s legacy persists not through inheritance but as an unresolved question at the heart of *Fulcrafall*: what happens to a system when the people who remember why it was built are no longer there to stop it?",https://i.redd.it/ebil0x53cocg1.jpeg
Dilemma about International investment from India,1q9te0t,0,1,2026-01-11 07:42:16,Patience_Research555,IndianStreetBets,"This post is more on the ethical, moral and long term repercussions of investing.

Since the INR is always on a free-fall WRT to the USD, it makes sense to invest abroad, as it will be more valuable as the global western companies keep innovating, increasing their market cap and rupee keeps falling. 

One simple way for a rookie like me is this [MF ](https://www.icicipruamc.com/blob/knowledgecentre/factsheet-schemes/Passive%20Schemes/Index%20Schemes/ICICI%20Prudential%20NASDAQ%20100%20Index%20Fund.pdf)from ICICI for NASDAQ. The constituents are mostly the well known global companies.

I am a person with very meagre resources for investment, but I still have a dilemma:

What happens in case of a hypothetical adversarial relationship of India with the west eventually culminating into a war between India and West? 

The recent abduction of Nicholas Maduro from Venezuela by the US government was thought provoking. The US did it for fulfilling their national interest.

What happens if in future, it is in their ultimate national interest to go to war with India? (hypothetical)

Here is the link on how the [technology ](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/)from one of the prominent big tech companies has been used in the Israel Gaza war.

I know that if one wants to make money, it is better to pack all the moral obligations in a bottle and throw it away. But, do we ever draw a line, or no line whatsoever?

But, if any technology from big tech or any other prominent company (where Indians have invested their money) is used in such a hypothetical scenario, would it not mean that the money that normal Indian citizens invested was used against their own country?

I would like to know people's perspective on this. I am not preaching moral high values here, just want to know different opinions on how fellow redditers from India have to say about this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1q9te0t/dilemma_about_international_investment_from_india/
19M college student confused between govt job prep and fitness career — need advice,1q9tdrr,1,0,2026-01-11 07:41:53,Educational_Youth484,NonZeroDay,"Hi, I’m a 19-year-old college student from Kolkata, India.

I’m very interested in fitness (gym training, diet, exercise science) and spend a lot of time learning and researching it, but I’m still early and can’t earn from it right now.

At the same time, I need financial stability soon. My parents strongly prefer a government job and have enrolled me in a job-prep institute. My girlfriend is also waiting for me, but due to family pressure on her side, I need to show clear progress toward a stable future.

I’m looking for:

Government jobs with yearly/frequent vacancies

No long preparation like UPSC

₹20k+/month salary

Also, honestly:

Is government job preparation still worth it today?

Should I build any parallel career/skill (possibly fitness-related) alongside job prep?

I’m ready to work hard and stay disciplined. I just want to choose a realistic path.

Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1q9tdrr/19m_college_student_confused_between_govt_job/

Is learning Informatica worth it in India?,1q9t0ik,1,2,2026-01-11 07:19:20,Che_ham,IndiaTech,"Hi everyone,
I’m planning to learn Informatica tools  wanted to understand the real job market in India.
Does learning these tools with hands-on practice actually help in getting a job as a Data Governance / Data Quality Analyst?
Is there decent demand for fresh or mid-level professionals?
Would love honest insights from people working in this area. 
Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaTech/comments/1q9t0ik/is_learning_informatica_worth_it_in_india/
"Need some guidance, pls help",1q9skuf,1,0,2026-01-11 06:53:46,suuuiiiiiiiiiii,getdisciplined,"I am a 19 year old, currently pursuing my BCOM from a tier 2 college in India, I have never felt clear about what i want to pursue as a career or what my purpose is. I had some interest in finance so i started pursuing FRM, but failed in level 1. Now i am very confused as to what to do, and the constant pressure from my parents of deciding what to do within just 2-3 days of the result isn't helping either. In India there isn't much value of a simple graduate degree. So they are pursuing me to give professional exams. I don't know what to do. I feel like all the bookish courses just make my brain go haywire to the point that i just have to cram information 2-3 months prior to the exam. I would like to pusue some qualification that helps me get into a field where I don't just have to sit on a desk for the rest of my life. Kindly give me some guidance 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q9skuf/need_some_guidance_pls_help/
"Fresher in India, 45 days in, 2-year bond – seeking advice for clean early exit",1q9shx9,1,1,2026-01-11 06:48:51,Silly_Foundation_108,LegalAdviceIndia,"Hi everyone,

I’m a fresher working at a private IT company in India. I joined around 45 days ago and am currently under a 6-month probation period.

At the time of joining, I signed a separate service/bond agreement requiring 2 years of service, with a bond amount of ₹2,00,000 if I leave early (described as training cost). So far, the training has been mostly internal and generic.

After joining, I’ve realized that I do not want to continue in the corporate sector and would like to exit early in a clean and professional manner, without misconduct or disputes.

My appointment letter states that employment during probation is performance-based and can be terminated by either side as per policy.

Additionally, the company is currently holding my original educational documents submitted at the time of joining.

I would appreciate advice on:
	1.	How enforceable such bonds are in India, especially at an early stage like 45 days
	2.	Whether seeking a mutual separation during probation is usually a safer approach
	3.	The legality of retaining original educational certificates
	4.	Any practical steps to minimize future issues (background verification, government jobs, etc.)

There are no criminal issues, no misrepresentation, and no intention to abscond. I’m only looking for a lawful and professional exit.

Thank you in advance.

The reality of India we don’t often notice,1q9sbxd,1,1,2026-01-11 06:39:13,Infamous-Hawk-13,TwentiesIndia,"I had a road accident and I was taken to a government hospital. There I was in a general ward with 20-30 other patients, that room was full of pain and suffering, everyone there was in immense pain. There was constant screams in that room, some of those screams were nerve wracking. But what caught my attention was a girl aged between 13 and 16, pleading to the head doctor there.

I have fought to get everything that I have, whereas all of them have parents who can give them everything I dream of.

How is India wrong in navigating foreign policy and defence capabilites,1q9qg03,3,2,2026-01-11 04:59:57,No_Palpitation_9512,GeopoliticsIndia,"India's **multi-alignment** foreign policy which is often praised as strategic autonomy has aimed to balance relations with major powers like the US, Russia, China while pursuing national interests. However as of January 2026, this approach has shown significant vulnerabilities, arguably backfiring in several critical domains, particularly energy security, defence modernization, and regional deterrence.

# Energy Security and the Russian Oil Bet

India's diversification of oil imports toward Russia post 2022 Ukraine conflict initially yielded economic benefits through discounted crude, shielding the economy from global price spikes. This move aligned with multi-alignment by maintaining ties with Russia amid Western sanctions.

Yet by late 2025 and into 2026 the policy has imposed severe costs. US sanctions on Russian energy firms (e.g., Rosneft and Lukoil) and reciprocal tariffs on India sitting at 50% one of the highest in the world. Threats of up to 500% under the proposed Sanctioning Russia Act 2025 have disrupted supplies(m personally i'm from surat and entire diamond industry of $21-24bn is doomed. Remember the largest building in world in surat for diamonds is now a ghost building due to tarrifs and textile too). Russian oil imports to India dropped sharply (e.g., from \~1.8 million bpd in November 2025 to \~1.0-1.2 million bpd in December), forcing reliance on costlier alternatives and raising import bills by billions. This highlights how over-reliance on one partner even for diversification has exposed India to secondary sanctions and geopolitical coercion, undermining the intended resilience. Russia is a soon to be chinese vassal, other than high end defence equipments it has no strategic value. Realtionship between russia and india is like of an estranged couple where in one partner is still stuck in soviet era tech and has fucked up it's calibre and relationship  globally has failed in ukraine war and now is becoming a liability.

# Post-Operation Sindoor: Information War and Equivalence with Pakistan

Operation Sindoor (May 2025), India's response to the Pahalgam terror attack, involved precision strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK. Militarily, it demonstrated capability and established a new threshold for counter-terrorism retaliation.

However, the aftermath revealed weaknesses in India's **information warfare** and **diplomatic outrich and narrative**. Pakistan effectively countered with disinformation, portraying the strikes as aggression and civilian-targeted, leading to international perceptions of equivalence between India and Pakistan despite India's focus on terror infrastructure. This has equated the two on the global stage, diluting India's victim narrative and complicating efforts to isolate Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.

Let me tell you what has pakistan achieved :- It has once again equated india pak on global level. It has gained it's geo-strategic position due to middle east wars. It has nullified the talks on india-china gap in defence capabilites and once again gained postion in becoming #1 enemy of india dethroning china. Once gain became a darling of CIA and biggest non-nato us ally. The real multi-alignment using china and US both. Deep western media penetration in terms of narratives establishment. Didn't allow india to establish that recent squirmesh was india vs pak-terror infr. It successfully showed india as aggressor unto a state.

# Widening Military Gap with China and Domestic Defence Shortfalls

The military disparity with China continues to grow. China's declared defence budget (\~$245 billion in 2025, likely 40-50% higher unofficially) dwarfs India's \~$78-81 billion (FY 2025-26 allocation), enabling rapid modernization in stealth, naval, and hypersonic capabilities.

India's indigenous programs lag:

* Tejas is in dooldroms, AMCA TEDBF is nothing but PPT's, No serious funding or investing in institutions to build capabilities.
* Joking clown debacle of ADG of lasers on ak-47 in night. Shows how unserious and full of ourself we are.
* Navy subs nowshere. Mig 29k are flying coffins. outdated carrierers, Not navy heli's too.

Defence spending stays at \~1.9% of GDP, with heavy allocations to pensions (\~24%) and salaries, leaving limited capital for modernization (\~26%). Recent corruption cases (e.g., army officer bribery arrests in late 2025) further erode credibility. PowerPoint presentations of capabilities, but actual funding and commitment fall short, unlike the US, which increases defence spending despite debt.

# Diplomatic and Dependency Issues

Jaishankar's leadership navigated the Russia-Ukraine crisis effectively, securing energy and avoiding full Western isolation. However, diversification from French (Rafale), Israeli, and Russian systems has been null, leaving India vulnerable to supply disruptions and geopolitical shifts. Ties with China remain strained, while US relations sour over Russian oil. Bets on Europe in 2026 appear optimistic, given Europe's own challenges and India's oil-related baggage.

# The Core Problem: Lack of Seriousness in Self-Reliance

At its heart, India's establishment appears unserious about indigenous R&D. Brain drain persists due to underinvestment in tech institutions, and expectations rely on joint ventures or technology transfers (from France/Israel) rather than building core capabilities. Without a massive leap, such as pushing defence to $100 billion (well beyond the current \~$78-81 billion) India risks remaining a ""PPT power"" rather than a credible one.

Multi-alignment has bought time and flexibility but in a transactional, polarized world, it has exposed dependencies and hesitations. Unless India commits decisively to self-reliance, reforms bureaucracy, and backs rhetoric with resources, the policy's process costs will continue to outweigh its benefits. The evidence from 2025-2026 global wars suggests a course correction is urgent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1q9qg03/how_is_india_wrong_in_navigating_foreign_policy/

I am from the West - Indians are severely disliked here,1q9lg19,0,18,2026-01-11 01:04:59,No_Apricot6965,india,"Are Indians aware of how severely disliked they are in the West?

I am from the UK and Indians are incredibly disliked here, and across the Western hemisphere. 

Whilst there is no doubt racism plays its part, but that's not the full explanation. On a surface level, in my opinion, the following reasons cause this dislike:

1. Support for Israel despite the Western consensus of a genocide being committed. In the West, this is seen as nothing more than deep anti-Muslim hatred. 

2. Recent images of Indian (Hindu) men destroying anything related to Christianity during Christmas. 

3. Indian men having a reputation for harassing women, and it being unsafe in India for female tourists, especially white Western females. 

4. R*pe cases that filter through to Western news. 

5. Poor hygiene of India as a whole, in particular the street food. 

6. Indians lacking civility and civic sense when they move to more socially developed countries in the West. 

7. Indians imposing their culture and music on the host nation. In London, it's very common for Indian men and women to play loud Bollywood music in public, cause a commotion and dance in the streets, without a thought for the locals. 

8. Bollywood being seen in a comedic light due to poor over-the-top acting. Without sounding offensive, it's seen as a bit of a ""clown show"" more than actual acting. 

9. The caste system. 

10. Corruption.

Serious question - are Indians aware of how they are perceived by others outside of India? It's easy to say people in the West are simply racist, but I'm sorry to say, some of it is self-inflicted. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1q9lg19/i_am_from_the_west_indians_are_severely_disliked/
The Server Room Siege: When a Raid Became a Street Fight for India's Political Future,1q9hpgp,1,0,2026-01-10 22:26:21,Head_Ebb4301,u_Head_Ebb4301,"**KOLKATA**—At 10:30 AM on a Thursday, the whir of server fans on the fourth floor of a building in central Kolkata was drowned out by a different kind of buzz. Officials from India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED), armed with a search warrant, had arrived at an office linked to the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC). Their stated target: evidence in a long-running money laundering case linked to an alleged coal smuggling syndicate.

What they found instead was West Bengal’s most powerful politician physically blocking the doorway.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s dramatic, personal intervention—arriving at the raid site with a phalanx of her own police—wasn't just political theater. It was a raw, desperate gambit born from one core fear: that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the center wasn't after bank statements, but the electoral playbook of its primary regional rival. In the frantic legal petition her party later filed, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) claimed the true target was the ""confidential political data"" on those servers, including ""campaign strategy and electoral roll-related data"" for the make-or-break 2026 state elections.

This was no longer just an investigation. It was a constitutional street fight over data, power, and the very rules of democratic contest.

# The Prize Wasn't Paper, It Was Predictive Power

To understand the panic, you must understand I-PAC. It is not a neutral firm; it is the TMC’s strategic cortex. For years, it has built the party’s voter databases, run its sentiment analysis, and crafted its micro-targeting campaigns. The data on those servers represents millions of man-hours and crores of rupees—a crystal ball predicting voter behavior in every district.

The TMC’s petition to the Calcutta High Court was explicit: the ED’s seizure risked an ""impermissible intrusion"" into this intellectual fortress. For the opposition, the raid crossed a red line from investigating past crime to confiscating future strategy. It’s the political equivalent of an army having its battle plans captured before the war begins. This fear explains the unprecedented response—a Chief Minister personally placing her body between the state and her party’s servers, declaring she was saving her ""party’s strategy for the elections"" from being ""looted.""

# The Counter-Narrative: Law, Order, and Constitutional Breach

The BJP’s response was one of cold, procedural outrage. A high-level delegation marched to the Governor, accusing Banerjee of a ""serious breach of constitutional propriety."" Their narrative painted a picture of a lawless state where the line between a political party and the government machinery had vanished.

Their argument hinges on a simple, powerful question: If this was a legitimate investigation into a multi-crore coal smuggling and money laundering case—a case where the ED claims a hawala operator channeled funds to entities linked to I-PAC—why obstruct it? For the BJP, Banerjee’s theatrics were not the act of a defender of democracy, but of a guilty party shielding evidence. They framed the spectacle not as a data-protection stand but as the ""breakdown of the State machinery,"" an attempt to use police force to render a central agency ""toothless.""

# A Well-Rehearsed Play in a Long-Running War

The chilling genius of the Kolkata raid is that it fits a now-familiar national script. As one political commentator dryly noted, in India, nothing signals an election season like a central agency discovering ""impeccable timing.""

This pattern is the opposition’s central allegation: that agencies like the ED and CBI have been weaponized as political tools. The playbook is seen in Jharkhand, where Chief Minister Hemant Soren was arrested; in Delhi, where AAP ministers have been jailed; and in multiple states where probes accelerate as ballots near. The Supreme Court’s old barb about a premier agency being a ""caged parrot"" has evolved in the public imagination into a belief in a whole zoo of creatures trained to hunt the ruling party’s rivals.

The I-PAC raid distilled this abstract fear into a tangible image: officials not just questioning politicians, but attempting to clone the hard drives that decide elections. It moved the battlefield from courtrooms and rally grounds into the server room.

# The Real Casualty: Trust, Not Data

In the immediate aftermath, the legal stalemate was total. The ED ran to the Supreme Court alleging obstruction; the TMC filed caveats and counter-petitions. But the deeper damage was to the fabric of institutional trust.

The event forces every citizen into a cynical calculation. For the BJP supporter, it confirms that corrupt regimes will use any means, even mobbing federal officers, to evade justice. For the TMC voter, it confirms that the Centre will use any agency, even those meant to fight financial crime, to rig the political game. The neutral space where institutions are seen as fair referees evaporates.

The siege on Loudon Street was a symptom of a democracy where every legal action is now a political event, and every political event is viewed as legal warfare. The question left hanging in Kolkata’s humid air isn’t about who wins the next election, but whether India’s democratic contest can survive a future where one side believes the other has permanently bugged its war room. The raid may end in a court settlement, but the distrust it uncorked will linger long after the servers have been powered down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Head_Ebb4301/comments/1q9hpgp/the_server_room_siege_when_a_raid_became_a_street/
Nepal politics - what do we need to understand? Part 2,1q9bvis,2,2,2026-01-10 18:41:14,NoRestaurant6163,Nepal,"Previously, I wrote a post in this group outlining my views on politics. It seems many readers did not fully grasp my position, and some responded with personal attacks. However, given recent shifts in global geopolitics (US attack on Venezuela, India buying more gold, China keeping quiet) and the fact that much of the Nepalese media does not address what I consider to be the core issues, I think it is necessary to clarify the arguments I raised earlier and connect them to recent political developments in Nepal.

I will begin with the Western education model. My argument is not against education itself. It is against how the Western education system, and its underlying assumptions, are imported and treated as universally correct. In the previous post, this distinction was misunderstood. To explain this properly, let's dive into democracy. Democracy is a system of government in which power is exercised by the population, usually through elected representatives. The problem is that democracy is taught and consumed as an inherently good system (see news and school books). Like any system of governance, democracy has flaws. These flaws are rarely discussed openly. At the same time, the failures of other systems are emphasized through narratives. As a result, people are educated to criticize alternatives while remaining largely unaware of the weaknesses within democracy itself.

This mindset is visible in Nepal’s political discourse. There is a growing tendency to frame politics as a moral binary: old parties are entirely wrong, and new parties or new faces are entirely right. This framing is simplistic and analytically weak. Political systems do not function on moral purity. They function on power, incentives, and institutional constraints.

This brings me to corruption and meritocracy. Phrases like “the right person in the right place” are vague and often used to mislead. They assume that governance is primarily a technical problem, when in reality it is a political one. In practice, power is sustained through trust networks, not abstract merit. The second-in-command is chosen based on loyalty and reliability, not only competence. Without this, no organization, whether a family, a firm, or a state, can function. There is no moral judgment here. This is how systems operate.

The same logic applies to corruption. Corruption is often discussed as an anomaly, but it is better understood as a behavioural feature of human systems. States do not survive despite corruption. Many survive because of it. The most corrupt countries in the world are not Nepal or India. Countries like Nepal, India, and China have endured for centuries precisely because people did not fully depend on the state and instead relied on personal networks, informal arrangements, and self-interest. This is what is labelled as corruption. When historically dominant states decline, it is often because governments become rigidly capitalist while populations become dependent and socialist in behavior. Nepal has survived because people remain economically self-reliant and do not expect the state to provide everything. As the current fiat monetary system weakens, this reality will become clearer, so I will not elaborate further here.

Regarding figures like Balen and Oli, I am not commenting on personal traits, only on public roles. Both have contributed to Nepal in different ways. Oli, given his long tenure, has had a broader impact. Balen, like Oli, has overpromised and underdelivered. This is not an endorsement of one over the other. Politics is not about moral correctness. It is a competitive game governed by rules. Those rules can be changed, but only by those who understand the system well enough to win within it. If one side loses, the rational response is to comply, reassess, and prepare for the next round.

Finally, I believe we have been taught incorrectly at a foundational level. Many of our political and social assumptions, inherited through western education frameworks, do not align with human behavior. Competition, not idealism, is the fundamental driver of human systems. Any attempt at reform that ignores this will fail. To change a system, one must first understand it fully. By system, I mean it more than elections. Asia’s population dominance over Europe is not accidental. Asian societies adapted to systems rather than idealizing them. That adaptability, not moral superiority, explains survival and scale (both time and number).

  
I want you all to consider development in light of this. What does the definition of development mean without the framework of western education system/definition? And how would you like Nepal to develop?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1q9bvis/nepal_politics_what_do_we_need_to_understand_part/
"The ""Ancient Wisdom"" Trap: Why Indian woman philosopher-novelist Shon Mehta’s work is everywhere, but her name often isn't.",1q9afnz,1,0,2026-01-10 17:46:11,Shadshadsha,u_Shadshadsha,"**Shon Mehta: Indian Woman Philosopher-Novelist, Global Reception, and the Mystery of De-attribution**

**Introduction**

Shon Mehta is an Indian woman philosopher and novelist who occupies a distinctive space in modern literature. A known **social recluse**, Mehta lets her work speak for itself, rarely appearing in **public interviews or functions**. This detachment from the ""celebrity author"" persona has allowed her works—which blend fiction, parable, and philosophical inquiry—to take on a life of their own.

Through novels like **The Timingila** and **Lair of the Monster**, Mehta engages deeply with questions of identity, power, and human perception. Her writing has achieved significant academic recognition across borders: her story **""The Girl Who Asked Why""** serves as the Primary text for Unit 7: Gender Equality and Equity in the Grade 8 National English Curriculum of **Pakistan**, and is also part of the official Class 10 SCERT/MGU curricula in **India**. However, her stylistic clarity and ""timeless"" quality have led to widespread de-attribution, where her original thoughts circulate as ""ancient"" or anonymous wisdom.

**Why Her Work Resonates Globally**

A primary factor in Mehta’s appeal is her ability to address **universal human concerns** through a distinctively clear lens.

* **Narrative as Philosophy:** Stories like *True Mastery* don't just lecture; they enact inquiry through character choices, making complex ethics accessible.
* **Temporal Ambiguity:** By setting stories in historically indeterminate locales, Mehta creates a ""timeless"" atmosphere. In her literary world, the kingdoms of **Jivavarta** serve as a sophisticated **sociological laboratory**, where she strips away modern distractions to isolate and observe the raw mechanics of power, ambition, and moral choice in their most concentrated forms. This allows readers from any culture to project their own context onto the story.
* **Aphoristic Precision:** Mehta condenses complex psychology into ""sticky"" sentences that translate easily across languages.

**The Paradox of Misattribution and De-attribution**

Ironically, the same qualities that make Mehta’s work successful—universality, aphoristic clarity, and her absence from public functions—facilitate the erosion of authorial recognition. Because her parables and reflections feel like ""pre-existing cultural wisdom,"" they are frequently stripped of her name and shared as anonymous proverbs.

**Notable examples of de-attribution include:**

* **The Ultimate ""Villain"" Quote:** *“Maybe I am a villain in your story, but I am a hero in mine.”* (Originally from her debut novel **The Timingila**; now a global staple of social media ""anonymous"" wisdom).
* **On Power and Corruption:** *“Power is the lair that breeds monsters... often, a new ruler enters the lair imagining himself to be a hero... however, as time passes, he himself becomes the monster.”* (From her novel **Lair of the Monster**).
* **The Character Test:** *“Judge a man's character by how he treats people he does not know, and things he does not own.”* (Often mistaken for a historical maxim).(From her novel **The Timingila)**
* **Moral Maxims:** Lines like *""When poor, overdress. When rich, underdress""* (from *Appearance*) often circulate as generic lifestyle advice.
* **The Power of Simple Joy:** *“Never underestimate the power of good food. Eating delicious food can be a life-changing experience.'”* (Widely quoted without credit in lifestyle and culinary circles).(From her novel **The Timingila)**

# 8. Looking Forward: Key Trajectories and Implications

**8.1 Political Outlook**

**Coalition Dynamics:** The stability of the JMM-Congress coalition will likely remain under scrutiny as political equations evolve post-Bihar elections. The government's performance in welfare delivery and infrastructure development will be critical for maintaining political support.

**Electoral Context:** With state assembly elections approaching (2026), political positioning and resource allocation decisions in December 2025 reflect parties' strategy for electoral competitiveness.

**8.2 Infrastructure Development Timeline**

**Accelerating Projects:**

* Thermal power generation expansion with Patratu Unit 1 operational, units 2 and 3 planned
* Highway connectivity projects approaching completion
* Renewable energy initiatives moving toward commissioning
* Power sector diversification supporting state's development ambitions

**8.3 Governance and Public Service Delivery**

**Positive Indicators:** Strong performance in law enforcement and case disposal suggests improving institutional capacity and public safety management.

**Areas for Improvement:** Opposition concerns about corruption and governance efficiency require continued administrative reforms and transparency measures.

**8.4 Economic Diversification Imperative**

The state's energy infrastructure expansion (both thermal and renewable) combined with women empowerment schemes and tribal development programs reflects broader strategy for sustainable and inclusive economic growth beyond traditional mineral-dependent sectors.



**Conclusion**

December 2025 represented a month of significant institutional activity and political complexity for Jharkhand State. The second supplementary budget of Rs 7,721.25 crore demonstrated continued government investment in welfare and development programs, while the Patratu thermal power project's commercial operation marked an important milestone in energy infrastructure.

However, the month also reflected underlying political tensions stemming from the Bihar election aftermath and coalition dynamics between JMM and Congress. Law enforcement achievements in Dhanbad suggest positive progress in public safety management, yet opposition concerns about governance and corruption remain contested issues.

The state's trajectory in subsequent months will be shaped by:

1. **Political Stability:** Management of coalition tensions and alignment with electoral cycles
2. **Infrastructure Delivery:** Successful completion of major projects within planned timelines
3. **Governance Effectiveness:** Addressing corruption allegations and improving public service delivery
4. **Economic Development:** Balancing mineral-dependent economy with diversification into renewable energy and other sectors
5. **Social Welfare:** Effective implementation of women empowerment and tribal development programs

Overall, December 2025 positioning Jharkhand at a critical juncture where political, infrastructural, and administrative decisions will significantly influence the state's development trajectory and governance quality in the coming fiscal year.

Where is indian left?? Literally itni shanti?,1q99hn1,1647,56,2026-01-10 17:09:26,Impressive_Garage167,IndiaSpeaks,,https://i.redd.it/cvxnea4w0kcg1.jpeg
Christianity is killing itself.,1q98qm2,4,100,2026-01-10 16:40:21,bravethink,DebateReligion,"I need to get something off my chest, and I don't care if it makes people uncomfortable. I've spent most of my life in church, and I'm watching our faith kill itself. Not because of atheists. Not because of secular culture. Because of us. Because we've become so allergic to truth that we've replaced it with two dangerous alternatives: fundamentalist dogmatism on one side, progressive slush on the other, with a huge amount of nominal Christians in the middle who can't tell the difference and don't really care.

Let me tell you what I mean, because I'm not speaking in abstracts here. I'm talking about real churches, real people, real damage.

I grew up in a fundamentalist church where the pastor spent forty-five minutes every Sunday explaining why dinosaur bones were either Satan's deception or flood debris. I'm not exaggerating, this was presented as serious Christian doctrine. As if believing the earth is 6,000 years old was somehow a test of your faithfulness. As if God gave us brains and then expected us to leave them at the door.

The thing that drove me crazy then, and still drives me crazy now, is that these people genuinely think they're defending historic Christianity. They think they're the faithful remnant holding the line against modern corruption. But they're not. They're defending a version of Christianity that's barely a century old. The term ""fundamentalism"" itself only dates to 1920s America. Before that, you had Christians who believed all sorts of things about Genesis without anyone questioning their orthodoxy.

Saint Augustine, one of the most influential theologians in Christian history wrote in The Literal Meaning of Genesis around 415 AD that Christians who make absurd claims about the physical world based on Scripture bring shame to the faith. He said that when non-believers hear Christians contradicting observable reality, they assume everything else Christians say is nonsense too. And he wrote that in the fifth century, long before modern science gave us any reason to be defensive.

Origen read Genesis allegorically. So did Philo of Alexandria. The idea that Genesis 1-2 must be read as a literal, chronological, scientific account would have been foreign to many early Christians. They understood something fundamentalists have forgotten: the Bible is a library of books written in different genres, at different times, for different audiences. You can't read a psalm the same way you read a historical narrative. You can't read Revelation the same way you read Romans. Genre matters. Context matters. History matters.

But here's where fundamentalism becomes actively destructive, not just annoying. The resurrection. This is the hill Christianity lives or dies on. Paul couldn't be clearer in 1 Corinthians 15: if Christ hasn't been raised, our preaching is useless, our faith is useless, we're still in our sins, and those who died believing in Christ are lost. The resurrection is non-negotiable. It's the whole thing.

So how do fundamentalists defend it? Usually by yelling louder about faith and quoting Bible verses at skeptics. That's not apologetics. That's not even an argument. That's giving up before the fight starts. That's admitting you have no evidence and trying to make a virtue out of it.

Meanwhile, the actual evidence for the resurrection is staggering. We have better manuscript attestation for the New Testament than for any other document from antiquity, and it's not even close. Over 25,000 Greek manuscripts and fragments, plus thousands more in Latin, Coptic, Syriac, and other languages. The earliest fragment, P52, a tiny piece of John's Gospel dates to around 125 AD, maybe 30 years after John wrote it.

Compare that to other ancient texts we take for granted. Homer's Iliad, the second-best attested ancient work, has about 1,800 manuscripts. Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars, which we use as a primary source for Roman history, has ten manuscripts, and the oldest dates to 900 years after Caesar wrote it. For the New Testament, we have fragments within decades of the original composition. The text is the best-attested ancient document in existence.

>

This is a creed, a formalized statement of belief that predates Paul's letter. Scholars across the theological spectrum date this creed to within 3 to 5 years of the crucifixion, based on when Paul received it (likely from Peter and James in Jerusalem around 35-36 AD) and linguistic features in the Greek that suggest it was translated from Aramaic.Think about what that means. We're not talking about legends that developed over centuries. We're talking about testimony from within half a decade of the events, from people who claimed to be eyewitnesses. This is historical gold.

Even skeptical scholars accept the basic facts. Bart Ehrman, an agnostic who built his career on New Testament criticism, accepts that Jesus was crucified, that his followers believed they saw him alive afterward, and that even enemies like Paul and James converted based on these experiences. Gerd Lüdemann, an atheist scholar, calls the disciples' experiences ""historically certain."" The debate isn't whether something happened, it's how to explain what happened.

But fundamentalists don't present this evidence. They don't teach their kids that Christianity is defensible. They teach them that faith means believing without evidence, that doubt is sin, that asking questions is dangerous. So when those kids hit college and meet their first competent atheist, their faith collapses like a house of cards.

>

That blood is on fundamentalism's hands.

But the other side is just as guilty, just quieter about it.

Progressive Christianity looks different on the surface. It's welcoming, affirming, full of talk about love and justice and inclusion. The music is better. The sermons reference poetry and philosophy. But it's empty. Theologically empty. Spiritually empty. Progressive Christianity has managed to strip Christianity of everything that makes it Christian while still calling itself Christian. Listen to a progressive sermon and count how many minutes are spent on the resurrection as a historical event. Not as a metaphor for hope. Not as a symbol of transformation. As an actual thing that happened in real time and space, Jesus of Nazareth, executed by Rome, physically raised from the dead three days later.

You'll be lucky if it gets mentioned at all. And if it does, it'll be hedged with language about ""the experience of resurrection"" or ""resurrection as a way of being in the world."" Translation: we don't actually believe it happened, but we think the metaphor is nice.

This isn't an accident. Progressive Christianity is the end result of two centuries of liberal theology trying to make Christianity acceptable to modern people by cutting away everything modern people find offensive. Miracles? Gone. Virgin birth? Optional. Hell? Definitely gone. Exclusive truth claims? How dare you. What's left is a vague spirituality that sounds Christian because it uses Christian vocabulary but means something entirely different. Jesus isn't the incarnate Son of God who died for sins and rose from the dead. He's a wise teacher who was nice to marginalized people and got killed by the empire. Following Jesus doesn't mean repentance and faith. It means being nice and voting for the right politicians.

This version of Christianity has been tried. Mainline Protestantism went all-in on liberal theology in the mid-20th century. They questioned the supernatural, affirmed everything culture wanted them to affirm, focused on social justice, watered down doctrine to make it more palatable.

And they died.

>

These are denominations in demographic freefall. And the excuse is always the same: ""Everyone's leaving church, it's just secularization."" Except that's not true. Conservative denominations that hold to historic Christian doctrine are growing or holding steady. Non-denominational evangelical churches are packed. Orthodox Christianity in America is growing. The churches that are dying are the ones that decided to be more like the world. Progressive Christianity offers nothing you can't get from secular humanism without the hassle. If Jesus is just a good moral teacher, why bother with church when you can sleep in and read Marcus Aurelius? If Christianity is just about being a decent person and fighting for justice, why not cut out the middleman and join a nonprofit?

The only reason to be Christian is if Christianity is true. Not metaphorically true. Not ""true for you."" Actually, historically, objectively true. If Jesus didn’t really rise from the dead, Paul was right, we should be pitied above all people, because we're wasting our time. But progressive Christianity can't say Christianity is uniquely true, because that would mean other religions are false, and that's too mean. So they retreat into relativism: all paths lead to God, Jesus is one way among many, we're all just trying our best.

And that’s where it gets really galling. Because progressive Christians are very selective about which religions they’re willing to criticize. They’ll write endless think pieces about how white evangelicals are complicit in American empire. They’ll call out the Catholic Church’s sex abuse scandals and they should. But ask them about Islam, and suddenly it’s all “we must respect diverse faith traditions.” Meanwhile, in Islamic theocratic countries, women face severe restrictions. Apostates are executed. Homosexuals are persecuted. Girls have their genitals mutilated. Honor killings occur. Where are the progressive Christian marches for them? Where's the outrage?

It's nowhere, because calling out Islam would require acknowledging that some cultures and religions are worse than others, and that violates the progressive commitment to relativism. Better to focus on safe targets, fundamentalists, conservatives, people who won't literally kill you for criticizing them.

This is moral cowardice dressed up as compassion, and it makes me sick.

But here's the dirty secret: neither fundamentalists nor progressives are the biggest problem. They’re loud, they’re visible, they get all the attention. But they’re small minorities. The real problem is nominalism, the vast middle ground of people who call themselves Christian but don’t actually believe or practice much of anything. They show up on Christmas and Easter. They like the aesthetic. They think Jesus was probably a good guy. They might pray occasionally when things get bad.

But they can’t articulate what they believe. They haven’t read the Bible in years, if ever. They couldn’t defend the resurrection to save their lives. They’ve never heard of the church fathers. They think “faith” means believing something without evidence, which is exactly what atheists think it means, and exactly why atheists reject it.

This is the Christianity that many ex-Christians were raised in. One atheist commenter I encountered said: ""I can't consciously choose to believe anything. I'm compelled to believe something by sufficient justification. I cannot on a whim believe that the sky is neon magenta with black polkadots."" He's absolutely right. Belief isn’t a choice. You can’t just decide to believe something. You’re either convinced or you’re not. And nominal Christianity taught him that faith means choosing to believe without evidence, so when he realized he couldn’t do that, he assumed Christianity was false.

Nobody told him that’s not what biblical faith means. The Greek word pistis doesn’t mean ""belief without evidence."" It means trust, confidence, faithfulness, the kind of trust you’d have in a bridge that looks solid even though you haven’t personally tested every beam. Biblical faith is evidence-based trust. It’s not blind. It’s not irrational. It’s provisional trust based on good reasons while acknowledging you don’t have absolute certainty about everything.

But nominal Christians don’t know this. They don’t know their own theology. They certainly don’t know how to defend it. So when their kids ask hard questions, they get platitudes. ""Just have faith."" ""God works in mysterious ways."" ""You’ll understand when you’re older."" And then those kids grow up, leave home, meet people who actually have answers, atheist YouTubers, Muslim apologists, secular philosophers and they leave. Because the nominal Christianity they were raised in couldn’t answer their questions, couldn’t defend itself intellectually, and offered them nothing they couldn’t get elsewhere without the guilt and boring services.

The statistics bear this out. Barna found that 30% of people raised in Christian homes leave the faith by their mid-twenties. The number one reason is intellectual skepticism. Not ""the church hurt me,"" though that’s common too. Not ""I wanted to sin."" They left because they had questions and got terrible answers or no answers at all.

And you know what’s tragic? The answers exist. The evidence is there. We have a historically defensible faith with better manuscript evidence, earlier attestation, and more contemporary documentation than anything else from the ancient world. We have philosophical arguments that haven’t been refuted in 2,000 years. We have archaeological evidence, extrabiblical corroboration, and explanatory power that naturalism can’t match.

But nominal Christians don’t know any of this, so they can’t pass it on. They’re like people starving to death while sitting on a pantry full of food they don’t know how to open.

Here’s something that will make people uncomfortable: Muslims are eating our lunch intellectually, and they’re doing it because they take their faith seriously in ways we don’t.I’ve debated Muslims. I’ve watched Muslim apologists. And you know what? They know their stuff. They’ve read the Quran. They can quote hadith from memory. They know the seerah (the life of Muhammad ). They can articulate Islamic theology, defend Islamic ethics, and argue for the Quran’s authenticity with confidence.

Now, I think they’re wrong. I think Islam’s historical claims collapse under scrutiny, the Quran’s preservation narrative is demonstrably false, and Islamic law is incompatible with basic human rights. But at least they’re in the arena. At least they’re trying to make a case.

Compare that to the average Christian. How many Christians have read the entire Bible? How many can explain the doctrine of the Trinity without lapsing into heresy? How many know the difference between justification and sanctification? How many have even heard of the Nicene Creed?

The numbers are depressing. LifeWay Research found that only 45% of churchgoers read the Bible more than once a week outside of church. Twenty percent never read it at all. The State of Theology survey found that 52% of American Christians believe Jesus was a great teacher but not God. That’s not Christianity. That’s something else wearing Christianity’s skin.

Meanwhile, Muslims are confident. They’re having kids. They’re building mosques. They’re engaging in dawah, Islamic evangelism and they’re winning converts, especially among young Black men and disaffected former Christians who are looking for a faith that demands something from them.

All this while Islam is objectively worse on almost every metric. Women’s rights? Terrible. LGBT rights? Nonexistent. Freedom of conscience? You can be killed for leaving Islam. Democratic values? Incompatible with Sharia. Treatment of religious minorities? Dhimmi status at best, persecution at worst.But Muslims don’t apologize for it. They don’t water it down. They believe they’re right, and they act like it. And that confidence is attractive in a world where Christianity has become apologetic about its own existence.

We need to learn from that. Not the content, Islamic theology is deeply flawed but the confidence. The seriousness. The willingness to actually defend what we believe instead of either retreating into fundamentalist bunkers or progressively surrendering everything distinctive about our faith.

So what’s the alternative? What does Christianity look like if we reject both fundamentalism and progressivism, if we refuse to be nominal, if we actually take this seriously?

It starts with the resurrection. Everything and I mean everything hinges on this. If Jesus didn’t rise from the dead, Christianity is false. Period. No amount of nice ethics or beautiful liturgy or social justice activism changes that. Paul puts it bluntly: if Christ hasn’t been raised, our preaching is useless, our faith is useless, we’re still in our sins, and those who died believing in Christ are lost (1 Corinthians 15:14-18).

So let’s talk about the evidence, because contrary to what nominal Christians think, we have it.

First, the manuscript evidence. I mentioned this earlier, but it bears repeating: we have over 25,000 Greek manuscripts and fragments of the New Testament, dating from the second century onward. The earliest fragment, P52, a tiny piece of John’s Gospel dates to around 125 AD, maybe 30 years after John wrote it.

Compare that to other ancient texts we take for granted. Tacitus’s Annals, one of our best sources for Roman history, has two manuscripts, the oldest from 850 AD, 800 years after Tacitus wrote. Plato’s Republic? Seven manuscripts, the oldest from 895 AD, 1,200 years after Plato. The text of the New Testament is the best-attested ancient document in existence, and it’s not close.

Second, the early creed in 1 Corinthians 15:3-7. Paul writes, ""For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.""

This is a creed, a formalized statement of belief that predates Paul’s letter. Scholars date thiscreed to within 3 to 5 years of the crucifixion based on when Paul received it likely from Peter and James in Jerusalem around 35-36 AD and linguistic features in the Greek that suggest it was translated from Aramaic. Think about what that means. We're not talking about legends that developed over centuries. We're talking about testimony from within half a decade of the events, from people who claimed to be eyewitnesses. This is historical gold.

Third, the empty tomb. All four Gospels report it. Paul implies it in 1 Corinthians 15. Even hostile sources acknowledge it. Matthew's Gospel records that Jewish authorities claimed the disciples stole the body, which means they were arguing over why the tomb was empty, not whether it was empty. And here's the detail that convinced me the empty tomb tradition is authentic: the women. In first-century Jewish culture, women couldn't testify in court. Their testimony was considered unreliable. If you're inventing a resurrection story to convince first-century Jews, you don't make women your primary witnesses. You'd have Peter find the empty tomb, or John, or all the disciples together. The fact that the Gospels embarrass themselves with this detail is a strong indication they're reporting what actually happened, not what would be convenient.

Fourth, the appearances. Jesus appeared to individuals (Mary Magdalene, Peter), to small groups (the disciples), and to large groups (500 at once, according to Paul). He appeared to believers and to skeptics (Thomas). He appeared to enemies like Paul, who was actively persecuting Christians when Jesus appeared to him, and James (Jesus's brother) was skeptical until the resurrection. The hallucination theory doesn't work here. Hallucinations are individual experiences. They don't happen to groups. And they certainly don't convert enemies. If Paul was hallucinating, he'd see whatever confirmed his existing beliefs, probably a vision of God punishing the heretics. He wouldn't see Jesus appointing him as an apostle to the Gentiles.

Fifth, the transformation of the disciples. These were people who fled when Jesus was arrested, who denied knowing him, who hid behind locked doors after the crucifixion. Something turned them into bold proclaimers who were willing to die for their message. People die for lies they believe are true all the time. But people don't die for lies they know are lies. If the disciples stole the body and made up the resurrection, why would they die for it? Peter was crucified upside down. James son of Zebedee was beheaded. Thomas was speared to death in India. These aren't legends, these are traditions with early attestation. People don't maintain a conspiracy to the point of gruesome execution.

Even skeptical scholars accept most of these facts. The question isn't whether the disciples believed they saw Jesus alive, it's how to explain that belief. And every naturalistic explanation fails. Did they hallucinate? Can't explain the empty tomb or the group appearances. Did they steal the body? Can't explain why they'd die for a lie they invented. Was it legend? Can't explain the early dating of the creed or Paul's firsthand testimony. Was Jesus not really dead? Roman executioners were professionals. Plus, even if Jesus somehow survived (which is medically absurd), a half-dead man stumbling out of a tomb wouldn't convince anyone he'd conquered death. The resurrection is the best explanation. It accounts for all the data. It's what the evidence points to. But you'd never know that from most churches, because we've stopped teaching it.

If we're going to turn this around , and I'm not sure we can, but I'm angry enough to try here's what has to happen.

First, churches need to teach apologetics. Not as an optional class for nerds. As core curriculum. Every youth group should spend a year on the evidence for the resurrection. Every confirmation class should cover the reliability of the New Testament manuscripts. Every adult Sunday school should tackle the hard questions: suffering, hell, science, other religions. If we're not equipping people to defend their faith, we're sending them out as sheep among wolves.

Second, we need to read the Bible in context. That means understanding genre. Genesis 1-2 is ancient Near Eastern cosmology and theology, not modern science. The Psalms are poetry, not propositions. Revelation is apocalyptic literature, not a secret code for predicting the end times. We can take the Bible seriously without reading every word literally, because ""literal"" means reading something according to its genre and intent.

Third, we need intellectual honesty. That means admitting when we don't have all the answers. It means engaging with the best objections, not the straw men. It means reading books by people who disagree with us. It means being willing to change our minds when the evidence demands it.

Fourth, we need to stop being afraid of culture. Fundamentalists treat culture as the enemy to be fought. Progressives treat culture as the authority to be obeyed. Both are wrong. Culture is the mission field. We engage it, we critique it, we learn from it where it reflects truth, and we challenge it where it contradicts the gospel. But we don't run from it, and we don't surrender to it.

Fifth, we need to tell the truth about other religions. The Quran contains verses commanding violence (9:5, 9:29, 4:34). Islamic law is incompatible with human rights. That doesn't mean we hate Muslims, it means we love them enough to tell them the truth and offer them something better. The same goes for every other religion. Relativism isn't kindness. It's intellectual cowardice.

Sixth, we need to stop making Christianity a political identity. Jesus isn't a Republican. He's not a Democrat. The kingdom of God transcends American politics. Christians should engage politically, but our ultimate allegiance is to Christ, not to any party or candidate. When we conflate the two, we make Christianity into an idol and drive away everyone who doesn't share our politics.

Finally, we need to recover the supernatural. Christianity is a religion of miracles. The incarnation, the resurrection, the ascension, Pentecost, the second coming, these aren't metaphors. They're claims about reality. A Christianity without the supernatural is worthless because it has nothing to offer that secular humanism doesn't provide better.

I'm tired of watching people leave the faith after being given a false choice between mindless fundamentalism and meaningless progressivism. I'm tired of seeing nominal Christians who can't articulate what they believe. I'm tired of watching Islam gain ground because we're too scared or lazy to make our case. Christianity is true. Not ""true for me."" Not ""true in a metaphorical sense."" True. It makes claims about history, reality, and human nature that can be examined, tested, and defended.

But we have to do the work. We have to read, think, engage, and defend what we believe with gentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:15), but also with confidence and evidence. The West is dying spiritually. The church is hemorrhaging members. The next generation is walking away. We did this to ourselves by refusing to take our own faith seriously.

It's time to stop. It's time for serious Christianity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1q98qm2/christianity_is_killing_itself/
Pirangut Talathi Ofc - Asking for Seva shulk (Bribe) to process 7/12 name change and threatening to reject if not paid,1q97pjt,96,13,2026-01-10 16:00:28,Icy-Menu1019,pune,"While corruption is normal in India, its going on a new level. 

A new lady officer joined Pirangut Talathi/circle office where final verification and approval takes place after online mutation that gets done at the time of sale deed. Some other staff also changed and so now they need bribe to process the files and threatening to reject it since they recently joined/transferred and have not received their cut. 

Builder already paid a lumpsum to old satff but since new staff did not receive their cut, they said they will reject files mentioning any reason and no one can do anything or question them.

They rejected for one plot mentioning that father name is not mentioned in Index 2 despite its already mentioned.

Now the new owner of the plot will have to hire a lawyer, bribe SDM office people, wait for 5 months (at least) and then bribe Talathi/circle office again when file will reach back. So 5 months delay and 1.5 L to spend more and  this is all when there are no issues or mistakes in the documents but just because so called honest government employees need personal seva shulk.

After hearing the news, I was like, what?? We the people are so helpless. Every govt ofc has agents to get the work done and without them, nothing, I mean literally nothing works.

I also heard that, to have the house construction files processed, every table has price and no one can have the files moved if seva shulk is not given.

Critique my proposal to Improving tax system,1q97jzl,0,0,2026-01-10 15:54:25,_anonimuz,IndiaTax,"Let's start by a simple question which I hope you really do answer.

**""If you are provided 100rs and you HAVE (can't keep it in your pocket) to invest in a state for development which one would it be ?"" - the choice MUST comply with condition 1 of CDT below.**  
 **For answer, provide what state you are native of, residing in and your CDT choice.**

Consider me a novice as I have only recently started to learn more about the Indian tax system and its history. (I'm still a student and will become a salaried tax-payer hopefully this year :) )

I of-course am here to learn and would like to learn from voices of people (before I jump into it with a chatbot). So please be a constructive critique and help

    Indian states receive a significant portion of their funding from taxpayer money, which comes through a combination of their own state-level taxes, a mandated share of central government taxes, and grants-in-aid from the central government.

I was just thinking on ideas to improve the system after reviewing previously posted similar queries. Goals being :

* improve responsibility of tax-payer so they start asking more questions and results from govt
* possibly improve transparency with tight conditions so that RTI on it will NOT be revoked as it'll be taxpayer's right
* force tax-payers to think about ""India"" and not just the state or city they live in

**Proposal**

Every tax payer (or maybe those above the 12LPA bracket - essentially to initially focus the bracket of population that has exposure to nationwide activities and are educated or knowledgeable) will control where 30/40 percent of their annual tax must be used in. Let's call this tax ""Civic Duty Tax(CDT)""

Conditions below :

1. They must choose to invest CDT in a state that does **NOT** fall under the below
   1. the birth-native state
   2. the current resident state (residing for more than 3/5 years)
   3. the state the person holds a voter card of
   4. OPTIONALLY, the person may decide to further choose a scheme or project of the chosen state to invest in as a recommendation to the state. The money invested MUST be in the form of CDBC for better tracking and transparency
   5. A person may not repeat the choice of state for CDT more that 3/2 consecutive years
2. If a state does get over provisioned by CDT, the Finance Ministry MUST re-distribute it to maintain balance but MUST also consider the choice of the tax payers in terms of amount and no.of taxypayers
3. CDT system MUST be transparent and completely under RTI so that any tax-payer of citizen may exercise his right to follow what happened to their CDBC and what's the result on that invested-in scheme/project
4. Eventually maybe, for high-taxpyers, NOT choosing a state for their CDT will result in a penalty

I was just thinking of how can we force people to think about India as a whole and not just their immediate vicinity or state ? Also to further grow inter-state investments and interactions -- to accelerate growth in India in a distributed manner

Of course there will be corruption, but would a slightly more distributed corruption (hopefully being monitored more strictly due to CDBC) be better than current situation ?

If such a system was to be built and you like the direction of it, how would you improve it ? ( to ensure the civic responsibility, transparency in the system and accountability of the central and state govt)

Are there any larger impact or consequences I have failed to think about ?

If you do not like the idea, why so ? what would you rather have ? or would you have NO change at all ?

p.s If people were to ask for a change in the system, how would they actually go about it in India legally ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaTax/comments/1q97jzl/critique_my_proposal_to_improving_tax_system/
Finally Read the Darn Comic,1q96gde,25,33,2026-01-10 15:10:30,SmileFiles,PoorAzula,"Hey! Decided to finally post after being a lurker. I finally read the transcript for *Ashes of the Academy* via the wiki. Here are my thoughts as I skimmed the transcript:

\- This is a baby franchise for babies. I must have grown up, because I felt like I was reading something for an early grade-schooler. No serious discussions of fascism, colonization, indoctrination, gender roles and how they tie to honor, the fact that Zuko seemingly let all the bad people off scot-free and is holding onto absolute power just like his father (Zuko is the ""good authoritarian""), etc. That said, I will still happily beat the drum that the portrayal of mental illness as it pertains to Azula is ableist and misogynistic and has no place in a franchise for children, as I think her treatment by the narrative and the fandom stands in stark contrast to the themes of redemption, healing, and forgiveness this franchise ""claims"" to tout.

\-  If they wanted to make Ursa more unlikable, they succeeded. Zuko and Ursa are so passive that they are good by default, as they merely react to evil agitators that break the status quo (which got problematic when the agitator was the untreated mentally ill teen with zero support network who cannot control her episodes in the previous comics). It's depressing that Zuko can't directly acknowledge that the school might have shaped his sister. I also don't like the subtle misogyny where Ursa says ""I don't want my innocent and pure Kiyi to go here and become corrupted like bad seed Azula, who I am not responsible for"", and Zuko as the patriarch of the family (in a sort of traditional Confucian sense where the first born male is head of the household) tells her ""Well, I get final say in Kiyi's education"" (basically), and Ursa goes ""I will learn to accept your judgement, son"" (basically). ""Brought out the worst in her"" to me implies that Ursa believes that Azula was born bad, then made worse. She wants to play perfect mom, yet claim she was powerless to stop Azula from turning rotten, by both external factors and Azula's supposed inherent vileness. And yes, Kiyi was a shameless prize for Zuko as a reward for being a goodie good boy so he could be allowed to forget his troubled sister.

\- Letting commoners into the school is so vague. Which commoners get to go? The ones with high marks, the ones in the zip code of the school? 100% the rich kids would either get pulled out of the school entirely, or they would bully the crap out of the poor kids. (See the entire online debate about the reservation system in India and how too deeply ingrained casteism is, or look at the fierce opposition to forced bussing or public school funding in the US).

\- Zuko has crazy plot armor. If he is trying to force the families to reconcile with the crimes during the war, it's a losing battle. Just look at how Japan in real life still struggles to acknowledge the war crimes. The noble families (that he forgot to punish/strip the power of like in real life) would ABSOLUTELY just organize to overthrow/kill him. Azula was already proven correct in *Smoke and Shadow* that Zuko is such a weak leader. Remember how he basically starved himself and turned into a tyrant at the drop of a hat (but it's cool when men don't sleep, and throw tantrums, and dismiss people trying to help him I GUESS /s)?

\- I thought this was a military school. They really could have benefited from researching the history of schools in Japan. These writers would be HORRIFIED to know that it is still to this day teachers strike children (even if it was recently ruled illegal to do so). Furthermore, there is a documentary of Japanese schools (2024 ""The Making of a Japanese"" which I think would have helped (they came out the same year I know, but there's plenty of material they could have looked at). Bullying is also commonplace enough that the bad cases hit the news. And furthermore, I don't understand this ""the school used to teach fear"" narrative when more so schools in Asia teach cohesion and unity (at times at the expense of the individual), and obedience/respect to authority/elders. My point is that Azula isn't unique or especially cruel. I wish they showed the school to be hyper competitive, balancing creating a cohesive unit with shining as the star pupil. Show the horrors of bullying and violence being swept under the rug. Show teachers looking away or punishing the weak/those who can't fit in. Show that the other girls were also a bunch of baby Azulas.

\- Why is Zuko personally writing the school curriculum? He's not a teacher. In fact, I don't think his education has ever been made clear (missed opportunity to show boys his age ALSO acting like a bunch of Azulas in his school, if he even attended school). This is a general problem in fiction where the King of the country for some reason gets sent on fetch quests and for some reason can be an authority on ALL disciplines.

\- OMG, Kiyi would have been humiliated, slapped, and forced to clean the classroom for talking back to the teacher. No little kid has a speech on historical revisionism on the ready. Not only that, I think the entire class would bully her for saying that they were the bad guys in the war (these kids would have lost close family in the war, would be angry). She's setting herself up to be completely socially isolated from her peers. It's almost as if there's more complexity to this issue that a sassy speech alone can't fix! And if the teachers are just too scared of angering Zuko, then that just proves my point that Zuko is just a rehash of his father. Wait, didn't Zuko tell Azula in a previous comic that she was wrong to talk back to a teacher by pulling rank(because the teacher wanted her to learn something), but then Kiyi can talk back to a teacher and basically take over the entire class by pulling rank too? (Lemme be clear, the Fire Nation are the bad guys, I'm pointing out a double standard). He should have just swapped out all the teachers for re-educated teachers that would have been drilled to teach the correct curriculum to avoid the scenario entirely.

\- How is Zuko so dense as to not be aware that peasants are treated poorly? He went through 3 seasons of that! Not to mention, HE was the one who used to use ""peasant"" like it was a slur. Again, no one would take the word of a tiny child over the esteemed headmistress of the school. She may be a princess, but the instructors are there to teach her and all the students to obey adults without question. Zuko is in a fight against an entire cultural framework, which probably would fight against him if he didn't have such strong plot armor.

\- Zuko proving himself as ultimate BF material by telling Mai that she has to now be an elementary school teacher (she can't say no to the Fire Lord). No misogyny there at all, no siree \\s. Also yeah, he still seems ambivalent towards his sister, which I get that she abused him, but at this point, IMO, the roles have switched and he was supposed to have matured as a person. IMO, he hasn't, he's just continued to fail upwards. Also, like, Zuko can just fire the headmistress instead of doing this nepotism/cronyism plot. Furthermore, Mai appears to have no teaching experience (Did Zuko just assume a woman would naturally be good with kids?). The parents would be quick to pull their kids out of a school where all they do is look at cicadas. Also, Zuko is proven correct that Mai would like teaching, which considering that he ordered her to teach gives me an ick.

\- Mai: ""We don't need to teach stinky politics or math because we lost the war. It's better to stare at bugs instead.""

\- I think Ukano's speech of be strong or be trampled actually is proven correct in the text considering that Zuko overthrew his father and sister by force.

\- I hate that Azula is seen as evil for being cunning but other characters who use direct, brute force are seen as ""misguided patriots"", as if direct war is not as evil as underhanded tactics.

\- I like how Mai and Azula first met, I wish that Mai used to like Azula more so there's more emotional conflict. But nah, Azula is a bad seed, remember?

\- Like Katara, Mai has been relegated to GF, but is too sassy to admit it. Which in terms of writing a female character is unfortunate when we all know that she'll just do as he says (like teach), marry him, and have his kid one day.

\- Now this is neat. Mai says that Azula was ""terrifying and cruel"", but also that she stayed because Azula made Mai feel like she ""mattered"". I wish they SHOWED this second part OMG. Considering that Mai eventually betrays her! Later, she blames the school for making Azula so paranoid that she banished people, which deflects her own responsibility, but I think Faith wants us to see that Mai doesn't 100% blame Azula (I think this is still done poorly).

\- Lol, when Kiyi asks why she was kidnapped, Mai says that even Azula might not know why she did that. Okay, I think I see what Faith is trying to do. The *Smoke and Shadow* reasoning was egregiously sexist (Azula wanted to lose her identity for her brother, a man, and to be a shadowy temptress that orders him to do evil so she could feel like a leader, which I guess women aren't allowed to be /s). I think this is supposed to be a step in the direction that Mai will open up to being friends with Azula again. The tone in this comic seems to be that Azula is a lost soul that the cast is just clueless to help. The cast is critical of her, but nothing suggests that she is firmly dead to them. I hate that this means likely that when Azula inevitably (sorry antis, it's gonna happen) gets a redemption, it'll either be in the vein of ""I, Azula, was 100% wrong, and I'm ready to submit to Zuko as Fire Lord and let the cast feel zero remorse for how they treated me"", or she's going to go on a vague journey to ""find herself"", with the blessing of her family, who again can feel morally smug that they caused her no harm and she's out of their hair. I think the authors are fence-sitters afraid of upsetting the part of the fandom that wants to see Azula as irredeemable.

\- Reading the Agni kai scene, these authors don't understand honor. See above. Again, the fear thing is antithetical to how a school that teaches hierarchy works. Not to mention that historically, only boys were encouraged to fight in school physically.

\- The entire Dai Li plot is dumb. I love that it's so dumb that Azula isn't even involved. IDK what Faith says, this is TOTALLY a meta-commentary on her fans and how we're dorks waiting for validation. This story also suffers from everything being controlled by the same, like 4 people. There's no sense of scale or community or even just staff in this empty school.

\- Ty Lee once again, contributes nothing.

\- Nothing notable happens in this comic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoorAzula/comments/1q96gde/finally_read_the_darn_comic/

BJP is painting walls with ""BJP's pledge is Assam's security"" and asking for our feedback on their manifesto. Congress is doing their outreach too.

Great. Here are MY questions. Answer these first, then ask for votes.

**CRIME AGAINST WOMEN:**

121 rapes in first 2 months of 2025 - our own Chief Minister admitted this in the Assembly on March 3, 2025. That's 2 rapes PER DAY in our state. Over 40,000 rape cases since 2021 (CM's statement August 2024). Assam recorded the HIGHEST crime rate against women in entire India in 2021 - 168.3 per lakh population, more than double the national average of 64.5 (NCRB Crime in India Report 2021).

our government admitted these numbers yourself. So where's the solution? You promised women's safety. Where is it?

**What happened to:**

* Fast-track courts you promised?
* The Dhing gang rape case where accused ""drowned while escaping""?
* That 16-year-old from Jorhat threatened with acid and deepfaked?
* Protection for minors when 10% of rape victims are children?

**INFRASTRUCTURE PROMISES:**

You promised development. Where is it?

* Roads still flood every monsoon
* Drainage systems that actually drain water
* Jobs for our youth who have degrees but no employment

**CORRUPTION:**

Coal syndicates. Sand syndicates. Land grabbing. Basundhara scheme benefits going to ministers' families while poor people wait.

Who got arrested? Who got punished? Or is it just opposition making noise?

**WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANT:**

Stop the wall paintings. Stop the slogans. Answer us:

1. Why is crime against women RISING under your government?
2. Where are the jobs you promised youth?
3. Why do our streets still flood?
4. When will rapists actually get punished fast?
5. What about the 15-25% commission contractors admit they pay?

Elections mean you need OUR votes. So answer OUR questions first.

Don't tell us what you'll do. Tell us what you DID with the last 5 years we gave you.

**To Assam Youth:** Elections are in our hands now. Don't just vote because your family always voted for someone. Question them. Attend rallies and ASK these questions loudly. Force them to answer.

This is our state. Our future. Our responsibility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Northeastindia/comments/1q93muw/elections_are_coming_time_to_ask_the_questions/
"If Pollution Triggers Another Corona-Level Plague in India, How Do We ""Survive""? (Spoiler: We Won't, But Let's Pretend We Can With Some Dark Humor and Political BS)",1q92zz5,1,0,2026-01-10 12:36:08,priyanshuuonlyy,u_priyanshuuonlyy,"Hey fellow smog-breathers of us
Lately, I've been hacking up a lung every morning, and it's not from that pack of Gold Flake I quit (or so I tell myself). Everyone around me is coughing like they've got a perpetual Diwali cracker stuck in their throat. Delhi's AQI is flirting with 500 again, Mumbai's turning into a real-life Gotham with zero Batman, and Bangalore's ""garden city"" vibe is more like ""garbage city"" now. I don't know why we've all been coughing for days—wait, yes I do: it's the pollution, you idiots. But let's dive deeper, shall we? Using my armchair expertise in psychology, politics, and a healthy dose of dark humor, let's speculate on what happens if this toxic air cocktail brews up another Corona 2.0. Because why not? We're all doomed anyway.
Psychological Angle: The Denial Dance
First off, psychologically, Indians are masters of cognitive dissonance. We've got that ""chalta hai"" mentality wired into our brains like a faulty neuron. Remember Corona? We went from ""It's just a flu, bro"" to hoarding Remdesivir overnight. If pollution sparks a new respiratory apocalypse—let's call it ""Smogvid-26""—we'll start with denial: ""Arre, it's just allergies from the changing weather!"" (Said while the sky is orange and your eyes are watering like you've been onion-chopped by life itself).
Freud would call this repression; we'd rather bury our heads in polluted sand than admit our collective inaction. And the survivor's guilt? Oh boy. The rich will jet off to their Swiss chalets, while the rest of us mutate into human air purifiers. Dark humor twist: Imagine evolving gills to breathe underwater because the air's too thick—except we'd drown in the Yamuna first. Psychologically, survival tip #1: Develop Stockholm syndrome with your pollution. Love the smog that kidnaps your lungs; it'll hurt less.
Political Deep Dive: The Blame Game Bonanza
Politically, this is a goldmine for finger-pointing. Our netas have turned pollution into a partisan sport. BJP blames stubble-burning farmers (code for ""Punjab opposition""), Congress points at industrial cronyism (code for ""Modi's buddies""), and AAP just tweets about odd-even while Kejriwal wears a mask that looks suspiciously like a campaign prop. Deep knowledge drop: India's environmental policies are a joke wrapped in bureaucracy. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is underfunded AF—allocated like 0.01% of GDP while we spend billions on statues and temples. Why? Because votes come from jingoism, not clean air.
If Smogvid hits, the government will declare a ""national emergency"" (read: excuse to impose more curbs on dissent). Survival strategy? Join a political party. BJP folks get priority oxygen tanks from ""donors,"" Congress gets legacy ventilators from the Nehru era, and independents? Well, you're on your own, breathing through a wet cloth like it's 2020 all over again. Dark humor alert: Imagine Modi ji addressing the nation: ""Mitron, this new virus is anti-national. But don't worry, we've launched a scheme—'Atmanirbhar Asphyxiation'—where you learn to hold your breath for 5 minutes. Sabka Saath, Sabka Suffocation!""
How Do We ""Survive""? (Real Talk with Dark Twists)
Mask Up, But Make It Fashion: Corona taught us masks are life. But with pollution, we'll need N99s that filter out PM2.5 and political hot air. Psych tip: Wear one with a smiley face to delude yourself into happiness. Dark humor: If you can't afford it, just use your Aadhaar card—it's got your face on it anyway, and the government's already tracking your every breath.
Migrate Internally: Head to the hills? Himachal or Uttarakhand might seem clean, but wait till climate refugees turn them into mini-Delhis. Political insight: This will spark interstate wars over water and air rights—Karnataka vs. Tamil Nadu 2.0, but with cough syrup rations. Survival hack: Become a nomad yogi; breathe pranayama until you transcend the need for oxygen.
Economic Darwinism: The poor will suffer most—slum dwellers already have black lungs from factory fumes. Deep politics: India's inequality (Gini coefficient ~0.35, but feels like 0.9) means the elite survive via private jets and imported air. Dark twist: Natural selection favors the corrupt; they've got thicker skins (and Swiss bank accounts) to buy bunkers. Us normies? We'll ""adapt"" by developing superpowers like coughing up policy critiques.
The Ultimate Cope: Humor and Therapy: Psychologically, laughter is the best medicine—until your lungs collapse. So, meme it out: ""Pollution so bad, even the virus is wearing a mask."" But seriously, if this happens, therapy sessions will boom. ""Tell me, how does the smog make you feel?"" ""Invisible, doc. Like my vote in a democracy.""
In conclusion, if another Corona-like bimari drops because of this pollution, we won't survive—we'll ""Indian-ize"" it: improvise, complain, and somehow limp on until the next crisis. But hey, at least we'll have killer dark humor stories for the afterlife. What do you think, redditors? Share your survival tips below, or just cough in agreement.

The Feral Dogs Who Roam the Himalayas,1q9t5ag,2,1,2026-01-11 07:27:24,Panthera_leo22,UnderReportedNews,"> **nytimes** In India, free-ranging dogs have become a high-profile problem with few easy solutions. Culling stray dogs is generally illegal, and it's an unpopular idea in a nation where compassion for animals is a strongly held value. But the dogs, which can carry a range of diseases like rabies, pose a well-known threat to human health; dog bites have been on the rise in the region, and fatal attacks have occurred.
> 
> Some estimates suggest that 25,000 dogs roam freely around the Western Himalayan region of Ladakh. The dogs have learned to rely on human handouts and scavenge on food waste, but in the winter, when tourism tapers off, many dogs have to find food elsewhere. They often prey on livestock and chase down wild animals, and compete with them for limited resources.
> 
> Dr. Abi Vanak, an ecologist at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment in Bangalore, said controlling the free-ranging dog population would benefit not just people and wildlife but the dogs themselves, which are prone to malnutrition, infectious diseases and accidents. ""It's not a good life for the dogs to be on the street,"" he said.

ITC Lost ₹70K Crore in 2 Days - Here's Why This Isn't a Buy-the-Dip Opportunity Yet,1q9rewd,7,3,2026-01-11 05:49:40,Muted-Basis-6687,IndianStockDaily,"**TL;DR:** ITC lost ₹70,000 crore in market cap after new tobacco taxes were announced. While it recovered from a similar 2017 crash, this time the tax structure is fundamentally different-giving the government a ""fast-forward button"" to change taxes anytime. Cigarettes still drive 60% of ITC's profits, and analysts have cut earnings estimates by 15%. Not a buying opportunity yet.​​

# What Just Happened?

Within 2 trading days, tobacco stocks got hammered:​

* **ITC**: Down 15%
* **Godfrey Phillips**: Down 19%
* **Total destruction**: ₹70,000 crore wiped out

The trigger? The government announced massive tax hikes effective **February 1, 2026**:​

* GST jumps from 28% → **40%**
* New excise duty: **₹2,050 to ₹8,500 per 1,000 cigarettes** (based on length)
* The old compensation cess structure was completely removed

# Didn't This Happen in 2017 Too?

**Yes, but here's the critical difference:**

**2017 Playbook**

* ITC fell 15% when GST was introduced
* Company raised prices 4-8%
* Maintained margins at 34-39%
* Net profit grew from ₹10,477 cr → ₹35,351 cr by FY26
* Stock eventually **doubled** by July 2023​

**2026 Reality**

**Back then:** Tax changes needed GST Council approval (slow, predictable)  
**Now:** Government can change excise duty via simple notification—**no council approval needed**​​

Think of it like this:

* **2017**: Turning a big wheel (slow, visible, gives time to adjust)
* **2026**: Flipping a switch (instant, unpredictable, ongoing threat)

The new excise duty is charged **at the factory gate** as a fixed rupee cost, not a percentage. This means:​

* Immediate cost impact
* Can't be absorbed through discounts or pricing tricks
* Forces direct price hikes to consumers

# The Math

To protect margins with a 50% tax increase, companies need to raise prices by **\~40%**.​​

In a price-sensitive market like India, that's playing with fire 🔥:

* **Option 1**: Raise prices aggressively → Kill volume
* **Option 2**: Keep prices stable → Margins collapse
* **Option 3**: Raise prices moderately → Both volume AND margins suffer

Historical pattern: When cigarette prices spike, consumers either:

1. **Down-trade** to cheaper brands
2. Switch to **illegal channels** (permanent market share loss)

#  ITC's Business Reality Check

**The Strong Stuff**

* Market cap: ₹4.38 lakh crore
* ROE: \~27% | ROCE: \~37%
* Dividend yield: \~4% (₹14.35/share in FY25)
* Operating cash flows: ₹17,000+ crore annually​

**The Uncomfortable Truth**

**Cigarettes = 59% profit margins and majority of cash flows**  
Everything else is struggling:​

* Paper/Packaging: Pressured by cheap imports
* FMCG: 9-10% margins (suboptimal)
* Agri: Flat/degrowth
* Hotels: Already demerged

**Translation:** Diversification looks good on paper, but cigarettes still pay the bills.

# Who's Holding And Who's Selling?

ITC has **zero promoter holding**—it's professionally managed.​

**Ownership breakdown:**

* Domestic institutions: 47.4% (LIC leads with \~20%)
* Foreign institutions: 37.4%
* British American Tobacco: 17.79% (down from 24.01% in Dec 2022)

**Interesting move:** Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (strict value investors) **increased** holdings from 1.01% → 1.17% in latest quarter. They only add when comfortable with value.​

But BAT has been consistently reducing stake. Their May 2024 sale of 2.5% caused a single-day 4% drop.​

# What Analysts Are Saying

**Jefferies**

* Cut earnings estimates by **15%**
* Cites ""weaker volumes + poor near-term visibility""
* Companies need 15-40% price hikes​​

**ICICI Securities**

* Cost increase of 22-28% for 75-85mm cigarettes (16% of ITC volumes)
* Requires ₹2-3 per stick price hikes​​

**Others**

* FY27 cigarette volumes: **13% lower** vs pre-tax estimates
* FY28 volumes: **13.6% lower**
* Revenue cut: 5.1% for FY27​

#  So... Buy the Dip?

**What's Changed** 

* The regulatory framework is now **unpredictable**
* Near-term earnings visibility = zero
* Policy risk is a **permanent feature**, not a one-time event

**What Hasn't Changed**

* Cigarette demand remains relatively inelastic (addiction dynamics)
* ITC dominates the legal cigarette market
* Strong cash flows support dividends

**The Verdict**

“This isn't a ""buy the dip"" moment yet.”

Wait for:

1. Price stabilization and consolidation pattern
2. Clarity on how much price hike consumers will absorb
3. Q4 FY26 results (post-tax implementation)

**Additional Context**

While the scheme sounded absurd, police say it exploited familiar vulnerabilities: greed, sexual temptation & fear of social stigma. 

Victims were shown photos of women, promised guaranteed payouts even for *failed attempts* & repeatedly charged under excuses like registration, hotel or processing fees. Many victims did not report losses due to embarrassment. 

Investigators also found the same group running parallel scams involving fake bank loans and job offers - an organised cybercrime network. Authorities also noted that similar scams were busted earlier in Nawada, highlighting a recurring pattern rather than an isolated incident.

**Psychology hacks used by scammers and fraudsters for different types of scams**

> **Impregnation scam:** Uses temptation and reward. Promises of easy money, sexual access, and “guaranteed payout” trigger desire, ego, and optimism bias. Shame around sex keeps victims quiet, while small upfront fees push them into the sunk-cost trap.

> **Digital arrest scam:** Uses fear and authority. Fake police or agency threats create panic and urgency, shutting down rational thinking. Victims comply quickly to avoid arrest, social disgrace, or legal trouble, even when they are otherwise well-informed.

**This is the core reason why awareness alone fails. In both cases, scammers bypass intelligence by hijacking emotion - either hope or terror, proving that awareness alone isn’t enough without emotional preparedness.**",https://i.redd.it/65abjk7u2ncg1.jpeg
A Simplified History of the Indian Subcontinent,1q8gxby,2,0,2026-01-09 18:56:47,Accurate-Self7608,EuroAsianMix,"The first humans in the Indian subcontinent came from Africa. Many thousands of years later, Iranians arrived and interbred with them. Out of this emerged the Indus civilisation, one of the oldest civilisations in the world. Over time, it declined, as power is never eternal and always shifts. At that stage, Aryans from Eastern Europe arrived. They were superior to the declining civilisation, and so the Indus civilisation was absorbed into the Aryan, creating a new civilisation which was a synthesis of the two, known as the Dharmic civilisation. Interbreeding also took place during this period.

Many years later, those in positions of power established the caste system, which became the largest institutionalised form of racism in human history. Those with higher Aryan bloodlines were placed in the upper castes, while those with a greater percentage of Indus ancestry were relegated to the lower castes. This has been demonstrated through both historical and genetic studies.

Centuries later, groups from East Asia, Central Asia, and West Asia entered the subcontinent. During this period, another civilisation, the Islamic civilisation, was introduced. Eventually, Europeans arrived, bringing with them Western civilisation. Finally, the British conquered the subcontinent and created a single administrative zone.

After the First and Second World Wars, Britain lost its former power. At the same time, the people of the subcontinent demanded power for themselves. As a result, India, along with West and East Pakistan, was founded. Later, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan.

India, which was founded 79 years ago, adopted the Colonial System of the UK instead of the UK System. Then it also incorporated elements of the Soviet Union’s model. Instead of adopting French secularism, it adopted anti-secularism, neutrality, and not adoption of modernising like the Japanese during the Meiji era, resulting in a failed socialist state called India.

Then our neighbour Pakistan’s founder wanted a secular, westernised country, but due to many reasons it became Islamicised and is now run by military dictatorship. It is also a failed state.

Then our other neighbour Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan with India’s help. Many years later, it experienced growth, but corruption persisted. Following protests, the country destabilised, radicalised into an Islamic nation, and became another failed state.

These countries give us a valuable lesson in how not to build a country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroAsianMix/comments/1q8gxby/a_simplified_history_of_the_indian_subcontinent/

"What if there was a new World order Bloc, without the USA and Israel, with no other religious state led countries, or dictatorships either - Military and Economic Bloc.",1q7t5jc,0,13,2026-01-09 00:26:07,Telinoz,whatif,"Recent events around USA threatening allies, NATO members, has led to a lot of discussions about the current World order. NATO, UN etc. Stating that allies cannot survive without the USA - Russia rolls Europe and China is more of a threat elsewhere to other allies outside of NATO countries.

What if there was a new World order, a new Bloc formed for Military and Economic reasons that set to ensure a new stronger more Global Bloc without the USA or Israel.

The attached images in the comments, and this post detail a possible Bloc that could be made.

  
Selection criteria, and explanations;

I used Freedom in the World Ratings website, Freedom House, with their Free, Partly Free and Not Free ratings.

This was to ensure, no dictatorship countries or territories make it to the Bloc, this just so happens to cover religious state led countries that are not free. Civil rights, political rights, Women's rights, minority rights etc.

I then sourced GDP data, to focus on economic side of things - and it just happens to be that the most global set of data is 2023 as most recent years is still being gathered.

Same with population data, as I wanted to see how that balanced out for potential forces for economic and military reasons.

UN lists countries, but I also wanted to add in territories as well that have their own voting rights, economy and GDP data, as in some cases you want territories to be in the Bloc for strategic reasons.



The new Bloc, must have a similar article 5 style clause - attack one, attack all - Otherwise the whole point on proving that the developed World can do without USA and Israel is lost... 

That applies to China as well, you will see I would add and recognise Taiwan as well, this is not just about Europe being stronger, but adding a deterrent to China as well.



Based on that, I grouped all countries and territories into 4 categories;

B - Bloc, added to the new World order Bloc - full access support, military and Free trade agreements for economic support.

N - A Neutral country, not in the Bloc, but some support for Military exercises and no limits for economic interactions

D - Denylist - Zero military support, sharing of tech, intelligence - and regulated, sanction economic interactions with the aim of cutting ties as soon as possible and find different supply chain solutions.

H - Hostile - No economic interactions, and obviously no military support or exercises.

  
The % of GDP spending for a Military Budget for the Bloc, which would be in addition to each countries spending, creates a decent budget for a Bloc Army as well.

Combined manufacturing, technology, a series of Bloc standard Military hardware can be made all the way up to an Nuclear Aircraft carrier - and, for those, I selected 6 carriers in bases at strategic points around the World which are detailed in the table notes and on the World map I made.

This is theory crafting ok, so timelines would be a minimum decade for most of it to be done, but key countries if USA drops out / kicked out of NATO could be sorted out in less than a year.

I also added a Map showing all approx 750 to 780 USA bases in other countries around the World, these would all have to go, and be replaced with new Bloc bases and soldiers.

  
As you can see, USA remains Neutral and the guidelines above apply - this is assuming they calm down and re-direct from their current path of threats to Canada, Greenland etc and other countries that are current allies.

  
The last part of the What if, adds in two more variations, India and Brazil.

I added a small sub-table, that shows what happens if India moves from Neutral to Bloc Status, and then another one that shows India AND Brazil moving to Bloc status.

I was curious to see what tips the balance in favour for the new Bloc for both GDP and Population.

This essentially creates a new World Order, split into 3 groups.

1.  The New Bloc

2. USA + Israel

3. Russia, China, Iran - pretty much the current hostile countries to existing alliances

  
vs. The two main groups at the moment, but with USA pretty much Veto everything amongst allies and thinking it can do whatever it wants, that needs to change.

  
At this point, it doesn't show Military hardware, troop counts, etc per country and that would take another few weeks of me playing around to work that out, as much fun as this theory crafting has been during the holidays with a few beers, I will leave that to a later time.. but, there are plenty of comparison websites, threads, YouTube videos on this as this topic of NATO without USA and how that would work for Military hardware is discussed a lot... 

Last thing, Global currency would change within these countries from the US dollar, going away from USA also means this has to change as well... likely pick would be the EURO as it is already in the bulk of the major countries in this new Bloc and a strong currency.

Failed Precedents and Painful Consequences of Radical Extremism and Perfectionism: Taking Communist Revolutions, Excessive “Political Correctness,” the 1989 Democracy Movement / June Fourth Incident, and the Hong Kong Anti–Extradition Bill Movement as Examples

Moreover, excessive radicalism and an insistence on perfect, thorough solutions often produce the effect of “going too far and achieving the opposite.” Typical examples include the socialist and communist revolutions and subsequent construction that took place around the world in the twentieth century. In contrast to the hierarchical oppression of feudal societies and the brutal coldness of capitalist societies, socialism and communism were beautiful visions aimed at human equality and happiness, and were indeed worthy of pursuit.

Yet in the Soviet Union, China, Eastern Europe, and even Cambodia, various enormous tragedies occurred in the name of building socialist societies and realizing communist ideals. An excessive emphasis on revolutionary purity led to endless political purges and rivers of blood; an obsession with the “dictatorship of the proletariat” shackled national development with dogmatism; economic policies that ignored real conditions and objective laws caused great famines and bloated industrialization; and the promotion of uncompromising class struggle resulted in the slaughter of millions of lives.

Although these tragedies had specific causes such as power struggles and interest conflicts, they were also related to the intense pursuit—at least in name—of the fundamentalist goals within Marxist–Leninist–Maoist theory. After suffering brutal far-left disasters and political struggles, many Chinese, Russians, and Eastern Europeans later turned to extremely conservative and laissez-faire far-right paths, which was itself a case of “extremes reversing” caused by earlier far-left catastrophes.

In recent years, controversies in Western countries surrounding “political correctness” have also reflected the reality that radicalism and the pursuit of perfection can provoke backlash. “Political correctness” is a product of developed societies that have accumulated extensive experience and lessons through various historical sufferings and have evolved into highly civilized societies. Specific “politically correct” norms include opposing discrimination against or mockery of ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, transgender people, and victims of crime or disasters; opposing the promotion of hatred and resentment toward particular groups; opposing the denial of historical oppression, massacres, and enslavement of Black people and Indigenous peoples in U.S. history; and acknowledging scientific conclusions in professional fields such as the reality of climate change and the correctness of evolution.

These forms of “political correctness” are necessary both emotionally and rationally, and they help protect vulnerable groups, reduce hatred, promote social harmony, and advance science. However, excessive emphasis on “political correctness” by some radical leftists and establishment figures has triggered backlash from those who resent it. Even some people who initially accepted “political correctness,” under incessant emphasis and rigid regulation—combined with real-life interpersonal conflicts and the darker aspects of human nature—gradually came to loathe it, deliberately expressing or privately endorsing views opposed to it. One reason for Donald Trump’s successful election as U.S. president was precisely his disregard for “political correctness” and his freewheeling expression of discriminatory and hateful remarks, which resonated with and attracted support from those who detested “political correctness.”

In some specific conflict events, radicalism and uncompromising thoroughness are also easily met with backlash. For example, the 1989 democracy movement had already achieved significant results, and the Chinese Communist Party had made enormous concessions that, viewed today, are almost unimaginable. At that time, support for democratization included not only figures such as CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, but even Deng Xiaoping did not strongly oppose democracy. Deng’s political stance was similar to that of János Kádár of Hungary—an enlightened pragmatist—who wavered between moving toward democracy and maintaining authoritarian rule, attempting to find a compromise that would allow partial democracy while preserving CCP dominance. Where history would head depended on changing circumstances and, especially, real-world power struggles.

At the time, both domestic public opinion (with broad support for the democracy movement across sectors) and the international environment (the peak of the third wave of democratization, with both the United States and the Soviet Union supporting China’s democratization, and democratic forces across Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa expressing solidarity) were highly favorable to China’s democratic forces. If the Tiananmen Square protests had ended peacefully, with students and people from all walks of life broadly participating in political activities and civic movements and putting the achieved consensus on political democratization into practice, China might well have undergone a democratic transition similar to that of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe later on—perhaps even with a better outcome, had cooperation between officials and the public been effective.

However, due to the intransigence of a small number of radical actors, compromise and withdrawal were not reached in time, providing hardliners within the CCP with a pretext. Deng Xiaoping also shifted to support suppression, and in the end it was like eggs striking stone: China’s subsequent historical fate was rewritten from “hope” to “darkness.”

(It is worth noting that after the June Fourth crackdown occurred, a temporary compromise was actually reached through the mediation of Liu Xiaobo and others among the so-called “Four Gentlemen of Tiananmen,” whereby students withdrew in exchange for the cessation of repression. From the perspective of protecting life and humanitarianism, this is of course beyond reproach and worthy of praise. But it also demonstrates the essential weakness of hardline forces and the cowardice behind their high-sounding rhetoric.

On the one hand, they were hardline, yet they had not thought through what to do if violent repression truly occurred—whether they dared to sacrifice themselves, and how to make such sacrifice meaningful. Had there been no compromise after the crackdown, and had students, workers, and citizens confronted repression head-on—given that many among them had intricate ties with CCP officials at all levels, including the highest—and especially if some idealistic children of high-ranking cadres, particularly those from military families, had rushed toward tanks and gunfire and been killed or wounded, thereby dragging their parents and relatives “into the water,” then after tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of casualties, the regime might indeed have hesitated, feared, softened, halted repression, or even collapsed or fled abroad.

Even if hardliners had continued repression, it might very likely have triggered splits within the ruling group and even mutinies (at the very least, those whose children, relatives, or friends died in the repression would not all have been cold-blooded and selfish), as in the Romanian case. In that scenario, even a sacrifice of 300,000 lives could arguably have been “worth it” if it secured democratic success for China, freed billions of Chinese people then and in the future from shackles, restored their rights and dignity, and left later generations to remember the courage and merit of those sacrifices as inspiration to strive forward and defend democracy.

But the actual situation of June Fourth was that, at the life-and-death moment when repression had already occurred but not escalated further, forces including hardliners and extremists instead became fearful, retreated, abandoned the idea of “using blood to open the people’s eyes,” chose to preserve their strength, wait and see, or even flee outright, rather than press on to create a turning point. As a result, hundreds to thousands died, tens of thousands were imprisoned, democratization was aborted, and the outcome was left tragically unresolved.

Such fear at the critical moment is of course understandable—bullying the weak and fearing the strong is basic human nature, and I myself have had similar experiences. But objectively speaking, this pattern—being hardline and rejecting compromise in advance, then collapsing at the first real confrontation, losing lives and prior gains—is the worst possible outcome for a struggle.

By contrast, India’s “nonviolent noncooperation” movement, which consistently adhered to peaceful, rational, nonviolent principles from the outset, saw participants face batons and gunfire from British colonial rulers, endure brutal beatings and even the killing of comrades without retreating or losing heart, and persist relentlessly until victory was achieved (of course, this was also due to differences in the opponent’s level of civilization, and the movement’s success had multiple causes rather than relying solely on “nonviolent noncooperation”).

The Hong Kong anti–extradition bill movement was similar. Setting aside whether some of its demands were reasonable, in terms of methods and outcomes alone, large-scale peaceful demonstrations had already forced the Hong Kong government to make concessions and withdraw the Extradition Bill, achieving more concrete results than the earlier “Occupy Central” movement and demonstrating to both the Hong Kong authorities and Beijing the will and power of Hong Kong citizens.

Had matters ended there, or had subsequent resistance remained peaceful and sustained, victory in parliamentary elections and other political contests would have been entirely possible (as confirmed by the results of the 2019 Hong Kong District Council elections), and greater political space could have been expanded on the basis of such public opinion and mobilization. However, the anti–extradition bill movement gradually evolved into violent acts of smashing, looting, and arson, including indiscriminate attacks on mainland Chinese people, pro-establishment individuals, and Chinese-funded or pro-establishment businesses and shops. These were not isolated incidents but became quite widespread, providing the CCP and the Hong Kong government with a pretext for repression. From the perspective of the CCP and the Hong Kong authorities, it was also impossible to tolerate large-scale violence or to compromise and retreat, as doing so would undermine authority, lead to more violence, and, for the CCP, raise concerns about imitation on the mainland.

Thus, repression became the only option, and moderate factions within the central and Hong Kong governments found it difficult to intervene. The cornered central authorities and Hong Kong government decided to quell the situation and take the opportunity to uproot democratic forces. Consequently, the machinery of violence and various public powers were fully mobilized; peaceful demonstrations and violent actions alike were suppressed; political parties and civic organizations were eradicated; and freedom of the press, speech, and academia were all destroyed. Hong Kong was left with no space for democratic or other anti-establishment forces to operate. (As for claims that even without resistance, the Xi Jinping regime would have destroyed Hong Kong’s democratic and localist forces anyway, this could indeed have happened, but it was not inevitable; even if repression had occurred, it likely would not have been as absolute as it is now. When one side is in a weaker position, it should avoid providing the other with pretexts for attack as much as possible.)

That said, whether in the case of the 1989 democracy movement or the anti–extradition bill movement, excessive radicalism and a failure to “know when to stop” were not the primary causes of failure, nor the only causes. Fundamentally, repression by the ruling group was the decisive factor. And even if compromise had been made, it might not necessarily have been met with compromise in return.

The CCP could just as well have used compromise—especially the termination of the movement and the dispersal of the public—as an opportunity to suppress grassroots forces that had already gained momentum and posed a threat to the regime, making it easier to defeat them one by one. The failure of “Occupy Central” can be seen as an example where peaceful assembly and dispersal did not yield optimal results. Although it had some impact, it clearly failed with regard to its two most important demands—“genuine universal suffrage” and “dual universal suffrage.”

If the 1989 democracy movement had “known when to stop,” it would certainly have achieved some results, but it might not have fundamentally altered one-party dictatorship. Limited freedoms and rights could have been reclaimed at any time by conservatives. If the people did not resist but instead endured passively, dictators who bully the weak and fear the strong might have become even more ruthless. As seen over the past three decades, despite widespread political apathy and minimal resistance among Chinese people, the stability maintenance apparatus grew increasingly strong in the later Hu–Wen period, and under Xi Jinping even the semblance of “peaceful, uneventful lives” has been denied to most ordinary people.

Thus, “the tree may wish to be still, but the wind does not stop.” When democratic forces are strongest, morale is highest, and mobilization and participation are widest, failing to seize the momentum and instead deflating oneself is also unlikely to produce good results. Had that path been taken, the CCP might have made some short-term concessions without abandoning authoritarianism, and later—due to changes in internal and external environments and political struggles—conservatives could have gained the upper hand, intensified authoritarianism, and divided and suppressed the democracy movement. The people, unable to regroup, would have been defeated piecemeal, and democracy would remain distant. In that case, today’s histories and commentaries might instead say that “the 1989 democracy movement failed to press forward and persist to the end, compromised and retreated, and thus missed a historic opportunity for China’s full democratization, laying the groundwork for later conservative forces to return to power and reimpose authoritarian oppression.”

During and after the anti–extradition bill movement, Xi Jinping steadily intensified authoritarianism and was unlikely to tolerate Hong Kong—a special administrative region under CCP control—acting independently and openly criticizing him and the CCP regime. Thus, even without intense resistance, Hong Kong people might have been gradually constrained through “boiling the frog slowly”–style repression, ultimately arriving at much the same outcome as today. It is hard to imagine that Xi Jinping and other power holders, amid extreme regression on the mainland, would tolerate Hong Kong holding annual political vigils commemorating June Fourth, or daily public political activities and media discourse openly opposing him and the CCP.

In sum, historical change is influenced by many variables. A change in one variable does not necessarily determine whether a particular outcome will or will not occur. Altering one variable can directly or indirectly alter others, and changing a single variable may well lead to outcomes just as bad, or even worse, than if it had remained unchanged. Compromise and moderation are necessary, but it is also wrong to attribute the failure of movements solely to protesters’ lack of compromise.)


The Pursuit of Radicalism and Perfection Can Be Maliciously Exploited and Invite Backlash: Taking Historical Reform Movements, the Distinction Between Corruption and “Political Donations,” the Different Evils of “Power” and “Capital,” Animal Protection, and the Evaluation of Political Figures as Examples

Excessive pursuit of radicalism and perfection can also be exploited by those who obstruct reform. Throughout history, when central governments have introduced policies intended to benefit the people, lower-level officials—fearing damage to their vested interests—have often attempted to resist them. They dare not openly oppose such policies, but instead push their implementation to extremes, causing good policies to produce harmful consequences and provoke strong resentment from all sides, thereby achieving their goal of blocking or overturning the policies.

Whether in various reform movements of ancient times (such as the reforms of Wang Anshi or the Hundred Days’ Reform) or in the numerous reforms and rectifications of today (healthcare reform, education reform, fiscal and tax reform), vested interest groups frequently and deliberately drive policy implementation toward extremes in order to force higher authorities to retreat or even abolish the policies. (Of course, some extreme measures are not driven by this motive—for example, Shandong’s “hundred days without births,” Beijing’s expulsion of the so-called “low-end population,” and the recent high-intensity COVID controls—these were not cases of lower levels intentionally pushing extremes to compel upper levels to halt policies, but rather of deliberately exerting force upward to curry favor with superiors, discipline the populace, and display official authority in order to gain benefits.)

Overemphasis on perfection also blurs differences in the degree of good and bad, and in the scale of gains and losses. It treats systems, policies, ideas, and events that are all imperfect but differ markedly in degree, as well as individuals or groups that all have flaws but where some are clearly “flawed warriors” and others merely “flies,” as uniformly “bad” or “evil,” asserting that “all crows are black.”

For example, it equates regulated and supervised “political donations” under democratic systems with corruption under authoritarian rule; it draws an equivalence between the relative economic tightness of ordinary people in developed countries and the struggle of Chinese citizens for basic food, clothing, housing, and transportation; and it compares limited speech restrictions in rule-of-law and free societies with the tight, comprehensive censorship of totalitarian systems.

Such positions may appear to reflect moral rigor and intolerance of evil (though some are deliberately malicious), but they inevitably lead to the situation described by the saying “when water is too pure, there are no fish; when people are too exacting, they have no companions.” They weaken enthusiasm and support for the relatively better side, allow those who are relatively worse, more evil, and more harmful to evade the proportionally greater condemnation and punishment they deserve, obstruct limited but valuable progress, and deprive further reform efforts of their foundation and stepping stones.

This is similar to how people in China often denounce the evils of capital and capitalists, while rarely mentioning the fact that capital is relatively gentler than power, and capitalists relatively less brutal than bureaucrats—thereby causing the more dangerous evil of power to be ignored or downplayed. Likewise, those who criticize the many problems of the reform and opening-up era often obscure the far darker and more desperate historical reality of the Mao era.

Opponents of animal protection often criticize animal welfare advocates for loving cats and dogs but not chickens, ducks, fish, pigs, or cattle (and if they claim to care about those, critics then ask why they do not also protect rats, flies, mosquitoes, or even bacteria and viruses). In this way, they deconstruct the value and necessity of protecting some animals, deliberately using rigid and partial logic (rather than a complete and systematic rationale) to negate the compromises that animal protectors make based on reality.

Beyond evaluating events, when judging historical figures, it is likewise inappropriate to criticize as equivalent those who all committed wrongs or crimes but whose degrees of culpability differ markedly. Figures such as Chiang Kai-shek, Deng Xiaoping, and Park Chung-hee, while authoritarian and responsible for the killing of innocents, also achieved certain economic and social accomplishments.

If they are lumped together with figures such as Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung—whose crimes were extreme—and all are labeled simply as cruel dictators, this may not be entirely indefensible, but it objectively downplays the evils of the latter group and erases the contributions of the former in certain domains. Such an approach, which fails to distinguish degrees of right and wrong, depth, and severity, is clearly unfavorable to an objective and comprehensive reflection of complex historical realities, and to accurate judgment and appropriate differentiation in dealing with historical figures.

Furthermore, under the effect of “extremes reversing,” when perfectionist goals fail, former adherents are likely to lose confidence entirely and become cynical or withdraw from society, unwilling even to participate in incremental reform, thereby pushing reality even farther from ideals. This is similar to how the failure of extreme communist policies led many people in those countries to develop a generalized aversion to all left-wing and progressive ideas.

The tragedies of the Cultural Revolution and June Fourth also lie in this post-failure conservatization. After the failures of the Cultural Revolution and the 1986 student movement and the 1989 democracy movement, Chinese intellectuals—and indeed large segments of the public—who had once been passionate about politics largely chose to withdraw, becoming refined egoists. The popularity since the 1990s of ideas such as “farewell to revolution” and “getting rich quietly” is precisely the product of failed radical demands and the collapse of corresponding political ideals. These outcomes are exactly what reform blockers and major wrongdoers hope to see and actively promote.

Extremism and the Pursuit of Perfection Often Come at the Expense of Others, Groups, Goals, or Values: Taking the Development of Heavy Industry in “Socialist States,” the “Dynamic Zero-COVID” Policy, WikiLeaks’ Disclosure of State Secrets, Radical Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Early Twentieth-Century China, and the Failures of the Two Ancient Emperors Wang Mang and Yang Guang as Examples

Extremism and thoroughness may appear “perfect,” but they are only “perfect” or victorious for certain specific goals or groups. For society as a whole and for broader, more diverse populations, they instead represent harm and failure—and they often rebound against the very goals they seek to achieve at all costs. This is because pursuing the perfection of one goal or insisting on the full realization of certain groups’ interests almost inevitably comes at the expense of other goals and by encroaching upon others’ interests.

For example, when countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea concentrated their resources on developing heavy industry, they consumed resources needed by other sectors, hindered the normal development of light industry and services, and turned peasants into “blood donors” and “sacrificial victims.” This led to distorted economic structures and an inability to meet citizens’ everyday needs for light industrial goods, agricultural products, and services, becoming an important cause of eventual economic collapse and systemic sclerosis.

Since the founding of the People’s Republic, various departments and localities have pursued “showcase projects” and enforced “one-size-fits-all” policies for the sake of political performance or to curry favor with leaders. While achieving certain objectives, these actions have inflicted even greater harm on people’s livelihoods. Similarly, in recent years China’s “dynamic zero-COVID” policy—centered on high-intensity lockdowns and quarantines—did indeed curb the spread of the virus, but it severely infringed on personal freedoms, damaged economic development, and caused tangible and intangible losses far exceeding the harm caused by COVID itself.

The actions of “extreme information libertarians” such as Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, and Julian Assange—publicly disclosing nearly all secrets they knew and advocating complete transparency of governments and politics—have undoubtedly helped expose the dark sides of U.S. and global politics and the infringement of citizens’ privacy through the combination of state power and big data. Yet extreme information libertarianism inevitably undermines counterterrorism and national security, damages international political operations and diplomatic relations, produces various negative effects, and in turn becomes a pretext for restricting information freedom.

In China after the Xinhai Revolution, the movements of “national salvation and enlightenment” surged. People broadly regarded resisting foreign invasion and colonialism externally, and pursuing democracy and prosperity internally, as firm and non-negotiable goals. In principle, this was of course correct. However, excessive nationalist tendencies—such as blind boycotts of foreign goods, harassment of foreigners in China (though many actions were self-defense), and the adoption of extremely exclusionary slogans—led to the deterioration of relations between China and the great powers, especially Japan.

Facing a neighboring and powerful Japan, Chinese citizens adopted radical anti-Japanese attitudes and pressured the Nationalist government to take a hard line. China’s radical nationalism, from a position of weakness, stimulated even more extreme Japanese nationalism and militarism, pushing the two nations into confrontation and making peaceful coexistence impossible, accelerating Japan’s invasion of China. As a result, China’s democratic development and economic and social progress were destroyed by the War of Resistance Against Japan and its aftermath.

Of course, the fundamental fault and crimes lay with Japan. Yet had there been room for compromise—had the Chinese people chosen to “bide their time and build strength” rather than loudly opposing imperialism and Japan, emphasized self-strengthening over excessive rigidity from a position of weakness—China might have avoided a series of subsequent disasters, history might have taken a different course, and Sino-Japanese relations would not have become as profoundly distorted as they are today. If one looks only at Sino-Japanese official and popular relations and interactions before the September 18 Incident and even the August 13 Incident, Japan actually rendered considerable assistance to China, especially to the Han Chinese, such as promoting the anti-Qing national democratic revolution and serving as an intermediary for the transmission of Western modern civilization.

After Japan’s invasion of China, especially the Nanjing Massacre, however, everything became irreparable. Even after diplomatic normalization, the relationship remained profoundly unhealthy and distorted. Japan’s support for the CCP’s dictatorship further destroyed any genuine friendship between China and Japan, a tragedy for both countries, and especially for China. The boycotts of Japanese goods and expulsions of Japanese nationals from 1919 to 1937 did not make China stronger or more prosperous; instead, they intensified Sino-Japanese antagonism.

By contrast, after reform and opening up, China’s comprehensive importation of Japanese goods and invitation for Japanese nationals to work and live in China effectively declared the failure and futility of the struggles a century earlier—losing both dignity and practical benefit. (Conversely, had China followed a path more like South Korea’s—focusing first on self-strengthening rather than boycotts, and only after strengthening itself pursuing autonomy and “rooted development”—it might have truly developed its national economy and safeguarded the interests of its people.)

History also offers many examples of feudal rulers driven by grandiose ambitions who spared no cost to pursue certain goals, such as Wang Mang, who forcibly implemented comprehensive political and social reforms, and Yang Guang, who was obsessed with massive construction projects and foreign campaigns. Some of their goals may have been well-intentioned and even had positive significance, but by disregarding real constraints and paying any political, economic, and livelihood cost, they provoked widespread rebellion and universal defection. By the time they abandoned their goals, it was already too late; their states collapsed and they themselves perished.

Their fates also demonstrate that excessive pursuit of narrow goals and self-interest, and an insistence on “perfection,” are often overly difficult and costly, especially as they provoke backlash from numerous groups whose interests are harmed. In the end, everything falls apart: not only are radical goals unattainable, but even preserving or restoring the former, imperfect state becomes impossible.

> We know we must stop this destruction. We know we are not alone. Do not give up hope for a world where life has a place, not greed for money, power, and destruction.

>Last night, we successfully sabotaged the gas-fired power plant in Berlin-Lichterfelde. This caused power outages in the wealthier districts of Wannsee, Zehlendorf, and Nikolassee. Power outages were not the goal of the action, but rather the fossil fuel industry. We apologize to the less affluent residents of southwest Berlin. However, our sympathy for the many villa owners in these neighborhoods is limited. We explain why in our article below.

>Our action, which is oriented toward the common good, is socially meaningful. We have also commented on this in more detail in our letter regarding the action.
The attack on the gas-fired power plant is an act of self-defense and international solidarity with all those who protect the earth and life. The infrastructures that serve the “technological attack” and promote the destruction of the earth can be sabotaged. Fossil fuel energy production can be stopped. Smart city metropolises, such as Berlin is supposed to become, can be prevented. With Stromnetz Berlin, a building block of this catastrophic vision of a smart city has been hit.

>For us, it goes without saying that we have ruled out any danger to human life at all times.
Our detailed explanation is attached to this information.

>NEW YEAR'S GREETINGS 2026. BE OF GOOD CHEER!

>Greed for power, greed for energy, greed for destruction
In the greed for energy, the earth is being depleted, sucked dry, burned, ravaged, burned down, raped, destroyed. Entire regions are being made uninhabitable by the heat. They are simply burning up. Or habitats are disappearing under the floods or due to rising sea levels. Several thousand residents of Tuvalu in the Pacific are already seeking refuge in Australia.

>Last year, the CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere rose to 423.9 parts per million, a value that surpasses all previous records. At the same time, climate researchers agree that the huge transatlantic ocean currents will eventually break down due to global warming. This collapse of the ocean currents, which has given the north a mild climate until now, is only part of the catastrophe that awaits us. The extent of this devastation is simply ignored, abstracted, and discussed at global climate conferences until the extent of the destruction has disappeared into tables and declarations of intent.
But the hunger for energy is insatiable and is eating its way through the Earth's crust and our lives, among other things, to feed artificial intelligence, which then spews out stereotypes and nonsense and confuses, disorients, and/or manipulates us. Meanwhile, language, expression, and liveliness are increasingly reduced, mutilated, and limited with each new “learning” of AI based on previous data.

>We feed our data into the “clouds,” which are nothing more than gigantic, energy-guzzling computing and server centers. They also drink our drinking water and excrete numbers that bombard us with useless, supposedly important spam on our screens until we have forgotten how to look our neighbors in the eye. Having become dependent on these small devices, we are always ready to send an emoji and feed “big brother,” whose algorithm registers our deviations from the norm and answers our search queries before we have even finished thinking. We sit together with our friends while the feeds consume us, and we sink into our devices instead of talking to each other in real life. We are serving our own surveillance, and it is total. The tech companies are in the hands of men of power, which we give them. We devour the colorful images that the machines filter for us and starve in front of our screens from loneliness and alienation. 

>We are becoming mindless zombies who run each other over in traffic. We are prisoners in a digital system that increasingly deprives us of our right to exist if we do not submit to the rules of the game and move our lives to social media, chat rooms, and artificial realities. We don't get any money, we can't book or buy anything in cash. Without access to the digital world, we are increasingly excluded, losing touch with what seems normal. We are afraid of what is happening to us and bury ourselves even deeper into our screens instead of turning off our devices and taking away the power of those who track, pursue, observe, and manipulate us. We blind ourselves to the knowledge that Edward Snowden risked his life to spread. We turn a deaf ear to the silent cries of indigenous peoples and farmers who see the planet's lifeline burning before their eyes. On the contrary, with every post we feed the fire that surrounds us and causes temperatures to rise to new record highs every year. One day, we will simply sit in front of glowing screens or dead devices and die of thirst and hunger. It is no longer difficult to imagine this.

>We're not saying we know the way out. But we know we have to stop this destruction. Hedonism can no longer ensnare us once we've smelled the cold sweat that spreads when there is no way out. No more forward and no more backward. Only the horror of where we as humanity have ended up. When the question comes back to us, what did you actually do to prevent what is coming? You saw it coming, the survivors, the next generations, will ask us. Please don't come to us with the parties. Please don't come to us with the brown alternatives in pinstripe suits and costumes. And not with the Greens or the Left either. Don't give us the economy, whose free market will solve the problem. Business and politics deal with death every day. With dictatorships and butchers. Concerns are virtually non-existent when it comes to satisfying the hunger for energy, for example. Russia is still supplying gas to Europe via Nord Stream 1. And the U.S. wants Venezuela's oil. That's why military attacks are now taking place. And fracking gas is being shipped in from all over the world. Currently, 79% of it comes from the US! Fracking is extremely harmful to the environment. Even during extraction, methane losses of 6 to 10 percent are assumed, which further heats up the atmosphere.

>95% of the gas burned in Germany is imported. Climate summits only produce tactical lip service because oil-producing countries are not interested in climate protection, but in money. Because metropolitan countries base their policies on money and growth, lobbyists in Europe are currently being given a free pass on the phase-out of combustion engines.

>German Minister of Economics Katharina Reiche, for example, was State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Transport, lobbyist for the Association of Municipal Companies (VKM), and manager at E.ON subsidiary Westenergie. E.ON Minister Reiche presents herself as a supporter of hydrogen, but is primarily focused on natural gas. She wants to issue tenders for additional gas-fired power plants with a capacity of 10 gigawatts, which are to be connected to the grid by 2031, corresponding to approximately 25 new power plants. 20 billion euros have been earmarked for these new gas-fired power plants.

>Reiche would prefer to postpone Germany's climate neutrality from 2045 to 2050 anyway.

>The main perpetrators of human-induced climate destruction are not those who suffer most from it, who pay for it with their health and their lives. The people of the Global South are already paying the highest price. The countries of the Global North, and soon China among others, are deciding the fate of everyone. China, as a communist, racist, and patriarchal dictatorship, can use “rare earths” to blackmail countries that do not toe the line, gradually weaving countries, cultures, and political systems into the cocoon of the new dictatorial world power. Over 85% of the world's refined “rare earths” come from China. And it is the rich who are the problem. It is the super-rich who are setting the world on fire. In the East, in the West, in the South and in the North. 60 percent of the investments made by the super-rich worldwide go into gas and oil. And around 300 super-rich individuals emit more CO² than the 110 poorest countries in the world. These criminals know this. They don't care. Their greed for even more wealth and power sets the standard that everyone follows. They are preparing their own “rescue” on isolated islands or in space once they have burned up this earth. A few years ago, we would have laughed at these misogynistic crackpots, but they are deadly serious. Zuckerberg wants more “masculine energy.” Musk “produces” children on an assembly line so that his clan will survive.

>None of the perpetrators are solving the “problem.” And the fundamental problem is certainly not being solved at the regional level. On the contrary, the whole world is arming itself for the final battle for raw materials, water, food, and access to strategically important regions in order to prevent or at least delay the demise of their own spheres of influence. So that the population can be offered the chance to participate for as long as possible. So that we in the global North, cocooned in a world of consumption and an imperial lifestyle, can participate and confirm the power of their increasingly authoritarian concepts. Because it is no longer about freedom for all, it is only about security for some. The promise of security is an exclusive right of those who can enforce it for themselves. We make the losers pay for our imperial lifestyle, those who are too weak to defend themselves against “us.”

>We reject the offers of participation in a burned-out world with our militant action. That is why we carried out the action at the gas-fired power plant in Lichterfelde.

>This does not prevent us from becoming entangled in an imperial way of life at the expense of other life, but it does send a signal. Once again, as many people and groups in different parts of the world are doing. As some groups here, such as volcano groups, have been doing consistently since 2011.

>We know that these words do not reach many people—they are so far removed from the idea of a world and a coexistence that is not based on destruction that these words reach them as little as the misery of the world that is transported daily in high resolution on our screens. We can list facts for miles and miles and still not be heard.

>We are not the first and we will not be the last to try to reach people with words anyway. We are not the first and last to resort to sabotage, because we are playing for time. At the same time, we and others are using the time we have gained to reverse the destruction of all life forms. People call us eco-terrorists, but we respect life. People call us irresponsible, but we are taking responsibility to end this imperial, destructive way of life.

>Our public welfare-oriented campaign is socially meaningful. We are trying to stop the exploitation of the earth, prevent CO₂ deaths, and halt the diseases associated with the climate catastrophe. We are also trying to put an end to species extinction and make the world a better place to live for everyone. Those who call us “eco-terrorists” are themselves the true eco-terrorists, expressing this in terms of selfish interests and power calculations.

>We see the unconscious who think they are smart and consider climate change to be fake news. They consider empathy to be woke and only have their own interests in mind, without recognizing how the things around them are interconnected. Behind this spreading rejection of facts, we see a system of those who invest in the destruction of the Earth. They are the same people who hold power over the tech companies, which allows them to breed a species of humans who applaud when people drown, die of thirst, starve, or otherwise perish in their attempt to reach Europe or the US. These manipulated prosperity chauvinists and party supporters second Trump, Modi, Miley, Netanyahu, Merz, Weidel, Putin, Höcke, Orban, Vans, Xi, and whatever else they are called, in their “defense” of freedom. The freedom to decide who must die and who must not. Who gets access to wealth and who does not. Yet every refugee who dies while fleeing has their counterpart here in a deep depression. Every person who starves makes us fatter and sicker.
We, the people of the global North, of the rich metropolises, derive no benefit from the misery of others. Material wealth is not wealth in the sense of an idea that can be enjoyed by everyone.

>If only a small portion of the population in every country would say, “Enough is enough. Not with us, not in my name. No one should die at our expense.” If we refuse to function and play along, if we become sand in the gears of a machine that we ourselves have been feeding, then something will start to happen, then we can develop the power to stop the causes once and for all.

>But we need an international movement to reject progress that is based solely on destruction, murder, and robbery. We call out desperately, angrily, and resolutely, joining the calls of others: Sabotage the fossil fuel infrastructure, the power grids, the exploitation of the earth, the server centers, the chip industry and its suppliers, destroy the foundations of the automotive and arms industries, of air travel, of mansions, yachts, spaceships, and golf courses. Destroy the police headquarters that guarantee patriarchal property relations, because the earth belongs to itself and to all living beings, not to humans, or rather to men alone, and not to the richest among them. This cry of despair is also a wake-up call, a cry of hope, and it has no local boundaries; it is global. We are talking about an international movement that does not refer to a patriarch, not to the gallery of heads that communists worship, but one that starts from different premises. One that is understood in China, in Europe, in the USA, in India and Pakistan, in every corner of the earth where Starlink has reception, in every country where the deadly drone seeks its target and needs electricity to do so. In every country where, without energy, the warring forces are blind and people can leave the battlefields without anyone being able to issue orders to kill them. Where the stock markets no longer function and bitcoins can no longer be accessed.

>We say it again, we have ideas but no definitive answers about the path. But we do have answers about the goal. Every contribution counts. But trying everything within our power to put an end to this imperial way of life cannot be wrong. The progress of destruction is man-made, and we can also stop it. In the steps of resistance, in the echoes of different languages and cultures, in what others send out to us, we will find and recognize ourselves. It's about the Earth. It's about life. It's against immature, stupid men at the levers of power who act as if they were operating a toy excavator.

>There is no time for frustration about resistance to man-made climate change and the growing number of deniers of this change. We must learn from our defeats, not by joining parties or privatizing or settling into collapse, but by establishing facts. Shutting down a gas-fired power plant is one such fact, but it can also be occupying land, squares, and forests, or destroying the golf courses and airports of the rich. Imagination and determination are required.

>Switch off the greed for energy, switch off the digital management of life, switch off the progress of destruction.

>Today we attacked the gas and steam turbine cogeneration plant in Lichterfelde. The power plant produces a total electrical output of 300 MW using natural gas. The target was the high-voltage power lines in order to cause significant damage to the company. We set fire to the cable bridge, which is not publicly listed and runs from the Lichterfelde power plant across the Teltow Canal, on the side of the green space. We also short-circuited the scorched cable strands with steel rods lying around.

>Das Energieunternehmen wird auf dem freien Markt Strom in Echtzeit kaufen müssen, um die Vertragsverpflichtungen zu erfüllen, die sie mit der Auslieferung des Stroms eingegangen sind, sobald der Ausfall der Lieferung bemerkt wird. Wir gehen nicht davon aus, dass wir dadurch 100.000 Haushalte vom Netz abgetrennt haben, sondern dass wir diese nur vom Netz des Gaskraftwerks abgetrennt haben. Das mehrfach gesicherte Energienetz wird über andere Wege der Energieleitungen die Haushalte in kürzester Zeit wieder über das weit verzweigte Stromnetz anschließen. Der kurzfristige Kauf von Energie zu den marktüblichen Preisen ist möglicherweise teurer als zu dem Zeitpunkt, als das Energieunternehmen den Strom an der Leipziger Strombörse (EEX) gekauft hat. Um nicht hohe Vertragsstrafen an die einzelnen Energieabnehmer zu zahlen bleibt ihnen kein anderer Weg. Wir haben über zwanzig 110 KV Leitungen kurzgeschlossen und die Fernwärmerohre nicht in den Anschlag einbezogen. Aber wir können Auswirkungen auf die Fernwärme nicht ausschließen.

>Our action differs in practical terms from the action in Adlershof on September 9, 2025, against the technology center. That involved a supply line that neglected redundant protection. The situation was similar with the “Vulkangruppe Tesla ausschalten” (Shut down Tesla volcano group), which took Tesla off the grid by destroying a supply line, affecting around 5,000 private households. In our case, the power will not be cut off in front of a facility such as the technology park or the Gigafactory, causing a blackout at that facility, but rather the power plant with its extensive network of cables will be disconnected from the power grid. It will still produce electricity, but will no longer be able to feed it into the grid and thus will no longer be able to supply it. However, the ability to supply private households via other power plants remains intact, which is also the intention of the authorities and energy giants. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that our action will have a greater impact on individual transformer stations.

>We have not interrupted the supply of district heating (thermal output around 690 MW).

> Individual households are not the target of this action. The aim of the action is to cause significant damage to the gas industry and the greed for energy.
If there are prolonged outages in private households, we want to make it clear that they are not the target of the attack. This effect was neither intended nor calculated by us. We have ruled out any danger to human life at all times.

>Since we cannot be 100% certain what chain reactions, beyond our control, our shutdown of the gasworks might cause, we have the following request for any households that may be affected: Ring your neighbors' doorbells. Please consider helping elderly or vulnerable people in the event of a power failure. Support yourself and others by offering solidarity and assistance. Keep each other informed.

>The combined heat and power plant in Lichterfelde was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swedish state-owned energy company Vattenfall AB, with annual sales of €7.6 billion and the fourth-largest electricity company after E.ON, RWE, and EnBW.

>In 2021, the power plant was “re-municipalized” and now belongs to the city of Berlin. As a result, the power plant is being partially dismantled and converted to accommodate additional capacity. This only sounds good at first glance.

>Stromnetz Berlin GmbH is currently making extensive investments in the expansion of Berlin's grid infrastructure in order to meet the growing demands of the so-called energy transition. To this end, Stromnetz Berlin's subsidiary BEN (Berliner Energie und Netzholding GmbH) is receiving €380 million from the European Investment Bank – “to prepare for the ongoing energy transition.” The “energy transition” is a smokescreen that obscures the fact that it is all about energy without transition and without ifs and buts. The main thing is energy, sustainable or not. Stromnetz Berlin wants to double its capacity by the beginning of 2030. The goal is a “modern” digitized power grid. In concrete terms, this means hundreds of thousands of meters of new power cables and grid components, as well as more digital services. We can guess that this is not being done out of charity. Ostensibly, it is about the city's security of supply, but on closer inspection, it is about a growth mania in a competition forced by the government. The battlefield is the city and our living conditions. The city is a commodity. Competitiveness with other major cities is intended to encourage more start-ups to settle there, more companies researching and producing armaments, more digital service providers and tech companies that consume even more electricity than the millions of Berliners use privately. It is also about e-mobility, which of course does not aim to promote public transport, but rather to put even more metal rolling through the streets powered by lithium batteries, and even more AI-dominated systems spewing out self-driving private vehicles. This is then classified as “infrastructure expansion,” which will cost the state another €3 billion by 2029, after the A100 motorway has eaten its way deeper and deeper into the city. Investments of up to €770 million will be made to renew the power grid.

>This all sounds rather tedious, but it is of great importance to us as residents of Berlin and Brandenburg, because it is our lives, our land, our water, and our future that are being negotiated here. For Giffey, the economic liberal of the SPD, the expansion of grid capacities and new power lines is a central prerequisite for Berlin as an investment location. These economic liberals, destroyers of a livable future, think of the city in terms of numbers, sums of money, growth rates, and competition with other cities. People don't count, or only as low-income or high-income variables. The former must be managed and restricted in some way—including through police and repressive measures, such as walling off a park in Kreuzberg. The latter are flattered, because their money stimulates consumption. For this group, the city is made smart and pretty. Berlin is a brand and is treated as such.

>For Giffay, the expansion of the power grid corresponds to the rapid digitization of everyday life, as if it were a force of nature descending upon us. As if it were not the tech corporations and tech fascists who are deciding on the implementation of AI, which, according to the Federal Ministry of Economics, will double global electricity consumption by 2030. It is not politicians and economic liberals who decide that cash payments will no longer be accepted on BVG buses, forcing people to use digital payments, which also ensures that they can be tracked, in a rebellious city with a tradition of militant movements that need to be controlled. When politicians decide to give the police and secret services access to Palantir surveillance software, whose driving force is a fascist from the US and whose software provides a digital network for monitoring people. Giffay promotes the expansion of the grid with “our” companies and the increasing electrification of mobility: “For the love of Berlin, the most modern power grid for the climate-neutral capital.” And, skilled at defusing criticism, Stromnetz Berlin has included “citizens' councils” as fig leaves, which can exercise ridiculous participation in trivialities but have no say in the direction of energy policy decisions and the design of the city. After Vattenfall and the city were forced by a broad citizens' initiative to initiate a “re-municipalization,” a nationalization of the power grid, and to appoint BEN as the owner, they are continuing business as usual and the madness continues unabated. The vision is clear: Smart City – Stromnetz Berlin says it all: “Berlin is on its way to becoming one of the leading smart city metropolises. This transformation process has already begun in all areas of urban life.” And: “Intelligent infrastructures, and especially the ‘smart grid’ (intelligent power grid), will form the foundation – as a networked operating system, it will become the backbone and catalyst of the energy transition.” Apart from the fact that we consider the term “energy transition” to be window dressing and would replace it with “technological attack on human conditions,” we agree.

>The specific attacks on the Adlershof Technology Park, Tesla's Gigafactory, the infrastructure of Vattenfall's Reuter coal-fired power plant, and Vodafone's hub in Adlershof are reference points for our action, as are the many militant actions that highlight the destruction of our planet. Even if these acts of sabotage cause high financial losses, they cannot force a change in political direction as individual (!) actions. But they point the way and direction that we recommend to all metropolises. Paralyze the infrastructures that serve the “technological attack” and promote the destruction of the earth. The consensus on participation in the project of an imperial way of life can be revoked. A mass social movement against the global destruction of the foundations of life and against all wars and resource plundering goes hand in hand with the ability to sabotage power grids and energy arteries.

>The attack on the gas power plant is an act of international solidarity with all those who protect the earth and life. Our resistance is diverse, and often, in the fog of disinformation, different cultural approaches, and linguistic differences, we still need too much time to recognize our commonalities. But we are confident that in the darkness, the light is not far away. When we place this action in the context of global resistance, whether in the US, Latin America, Asia, China, Russia, Europe, or Australia, against all manifestations of domination, rule, and destruction of the earth, we are confident that we will be heard, that these contributions will be translated, that translated contributions will reach us, that subversive communication will take place on the winding paths of resistance, recognizing each other. And intervening. And doing so without bloodshed, if possible, but determined to cut off the rulers' lifeline.

What are your controversial alternate history opinions?,1q597ys,9,6,2026-01-06 04:49:00,maproomzibz,WIAH,"Here's mine: 

\- if Byzantines survived into modern day, it would eventually become some kind of Eastern European dictatorship, or some kind of corrupt low trust society country like modern day Greece, not some glorious country. And Westerners would continue to bash it as a backward place. 

\- Korea would've been better off without Korean War and North conquering it all.

\- Al-Andalus, if it survived, would not go to America and colonize it, like the Spanish did.

\- Alexander the Great would not be able to conquer India if he survived, (India already had a competant ruler, Chandragupta, and their empire to Macedonia would be like Persia and Rome).

\- All AHs that include Rome magically expanding more and more, (and even worse colonizing America) are all boring and unrealistic (and then the same classical culture with same architecture surviving), and I would refer to watch a Roman alternate history going through cycles like China or other civilizations. And Rome become a larger Byzantium, and then also getting cultural influences from Germans, and then interacting with future Muslim or Slavic  countries like Poland, Russia and Caliphate.

\- Even as a pro-Palestine, all the scenarios of Jews being sent to Kenya, Madagascar, etc are all dumb.

I will stand with them, regardless of whether Israel contributes to their suffering or not.

Speaking of which, I rarely see you support them, and when you do, you often  ignore all responsibility that Israel bears for injustice against them. It's almost like you don't actually care about them and only want to use a weak whataboutism argument to both distract from what is happening in Palestine and to personally attack the people speaking out against it. 

Even if Israel never supported the regimes I just talked about, it would not justify, among other things:

The eviction of thousands of Palestinian fellaheen before 1948

The Ethnic Cleansing of the Nakba between 1947 and 49
The continued Ethnic Cleansing of Palestinians (especially the Naqab Bedouin) between 1949 and 1967

The occupation of the rest of Palestine in 1967 which caused another wave of Ethnic Cleansing called the Naksa

The continued Ethnic Cleansing from then until today

The building of illegal settlements both within and outside the Green Line

The terribly inadequate response to settler terrorism against Palestinians

The apartheid against Palestinians through legally protected discrimination in land sales, housing, funding of government institutions and other parts of life

The blockade of Gaza after 2006 and the collective punishment of the population of Gaza that the UN predicted would make the place unliveable by 2020

The Genocide of Gaza from 2023 to 2025 where at least 80,000 identified dead were killed by direct Israeli actions (not to mention the ones who have not yet been found) and where most of Gaza faced some of the worst destruction in modern history. 

The systematic rape and torture in absolutely vile ways, of Palestinians all across Palestine from 1948 until today, causing unimaginable trauma for survivors 

The appropriation of Palestinian heritage, whether that be food, archeological sites, clothing or anything else that is claimed as Israeli when in reality it is not

The very denial of the existence of Palestinians as a distinct people group (let alone an indigenous one) despite numerous records showing South Levantine Arabs identifying as Palestinians well before the zionist movement (and every genetic study including Palestinians confirming that they are Arabized descendants of Bronze Age Levantine groups like Canaanites)

The dehumanization of Palestinians sickeningly prevalent across Israeli society that robs them of the very opportunity to be taken seriously as equal human beings, let alone progress in their lives 

Nothing justifies the decades of cruelty that the State of Israel and Zionism have enacted upon the people of Palestine, and nothing will stop Palestinians from one day being free in the land of their ancestors ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1q3rciq/dear_zionists_i_condemn_atrocities_happening_in/
USA is right in invading Venezuela,1q2w81p,3,22,2026-01-03 14:41:33,discipline4succes,KeralaDesham,"I saw a post here demonizing the USA and making Venezuela and maduro look good, this post is a rely to that 

1. The main reason 

• China is encircling Taiwan

• In 2027, China will commemorate the 100th anniversary (Centenary) of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)

• Xi Jinping has said his generals to have Taiwan as part of China by 2027.

• 40% of Chinas heavy crude oil imports is from....

U guessed it.... Venezuela....

• Think of how huge China and its population military

• If USA hold venezuelas heavy crude oil supply and stops supply to them, it’s gonna cost China a lot more and harder for them if war starts

2 Secondary reason 

• Venezuela is not a democracy, it’s an authoritarian state

• Means a dictator and his military and intelligence organization is running the country, not the people 

• USA is coming to bring democracy to Venezuela is giving humans in Venezuela political rights 

3 Minor reason 

USA imperialism is way better Chinese imperialism

USA imperialism ideology is democracy, Chinese imperialism ideology is  dictatorship and no form of criticism 

4 Another minor reason 

This is not a republican or a democrat issue. This is an American issue, a global issue for democracy. Hurting Chinese heavy crude oil imports or at least making it more expensive and also meantime bringing democracy to Venezuela is worth a war with Venezuela 

5 India’s Relation

• A weak China is better for India, 

• China has territorial claims on eastern India, 

• China is already occupying a part of Kashmir, 

• During the pahalgam attacks and Indias retaliation on Pakistan. China was fully on pakistans side

• While America was at least bit more neutral maybe even pro India. But definitely more pro India and anti Pakistan than China 

6 Minorities

• Literally all relegious people, Hindus, Muslims, christians. They’re all safer and in a better place in a us global hegemony world than Chinese global hegemony world

The Background, Characteristics, and Influence of The Taebaek Mountains

    The film The Taebaek Mountains is adapted from the long novel of the same name by the Korean writer Jo Jung-rae. It tells and depicts a series of historical events that occurred in Beolgyo-eup, Boseong County, South Jeolla Province, during the period from Japan’s surrender to the outbreak of the Korean War. (In Korea, an “eup” is roughly equivalent to a “township” in China.) The Taebaek Mountains presents not only the customs and stories characteristic of South Jeolla Province and the Beolgyo region, but also reflects the historical realities widely seen across the entire “three-thousand-li land” of the Korean Peninsula during those years. After the original work was adapted into a film, the complex narrative was condensed, yet the film still preserved the basic structure of the story, restored the essence conveyed by the novel, and, by making use of the advantages of visual media, rendered the story more vivid, expressive, and emotionally compelling.

    Moreover, the superb direction of Im Kwon-taek—known as the “Godfather of Korean Cinema”—and the outstanding performances of actors such as Ahn Sung-ki, the “national leading actor,” further enhanced the excellence of the film. Upon its release in 1994, the film won more than ten awards, including Best Film at the Blue Dragon Awards, the highest honor in Korean cinema, marking a milestone in Korean film history. 

The publication of the complete version of the novel, as well as the production and release of the film, all took place several years after Korea’s democratization in 1987. For this reason, the film also reflects the social sentiments of the time—when the right-wing military dictatorship had ended, pluralistic democratic politics was beginning to take shape, and Korean society, especially the intellectual community, was reexamining history, calling for humanitarianism, and experiencing the rise of center-left ideologies.

    Yet what the film reflects goes far beyond these aspects; it carries even richer and more complex meanings and values. To explore these, one must examine and analyze the detailed content of the novel and the film one by one.


The Repeated “Changes of Flags” in Beolgyo-eup, South Jeolla Province: Beginning with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident

    At the beginning of the film, subtitles explain the historical background of The Taebaek Mountains: the U.S.–Soviet Cold War and ideological confrontation led to the division and conflict of the Korean Peninsula. The melancholy opening theme and the scene of a flock of geese circling above the Taebaek Mountains foreshadow the tragic nature of this story.

    The film opens with the ringing of telephones in the police station and the youth corps breaking the nighttime quiet of Beolgyo. Yeom Sang-gu, the inspector general of the youth corps who is playing cards, and Nam In-tae, the police chief on duty at the station, hear news of a revolt in Yeosu and the fall of Suncheon. They immediately flee Beolgyo with their men. Meanwhile, Yeom Sang-gu’s elder brother, Yeom Sang-jin—who had joined the South Korean Workers’ Party (the South Korean branch of the Workers’ Party of Korea, conducting underground activities in areas controlled by the Rhee Syngman regime)—leads a guerrilla unit under the command of the South Jeolla Provincial Party Committee, raising the North Korean flag and occupying Beolgyo without a fight.

    The real historical background of this story is the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident of October 1948. Anyone with some knowledge of modern Korean Peninsula history will be familiar with this event. It was the largest military rebellion to occur after the establishment of the Rhee Syngman regime, which governed the southern side of the 38th parallel, and it had major implications for the peninsula’s situation. Before the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident, the Rhee regime’s rule was relatively stable, and Kim Il-sung had not yet decided to invade the South. But after the incident, Kim Il-sung perceived conflict within Rhee’s government and widespread social unrest, and consequently decided to march south to unify the peninsula.

    Indeed, the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident was a concentrated reflection of the unstable military morale, fragmented public sentiment, and social turbulence in the southern half of the peninsula (for convenience, hereafter abbreviated as “South Korea,” even though some events occurred before the formal founding of the Republic of Korea). The immediate trigger for the incident was the refusal of certain Korean troops stationed in Yeosu to suppress the civilian uprising in Jeju. And the cause of the Jeju uprising itself was the military and police suppression of demonstrators. Both the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion and the Jeju uprising were supported and encouraged by the South Korean Workers’ Party.

    The fundamental reason the South Korean Workers’ Party was able to successfully incite revolt was the severe social contradictions in South Korea and the authoritarian and arbitrary rule of the Rhee Syngman regime (these two points will be discussed in later sections). 

Meanwhile, the left-wing forces advocating the establishment of a “communist paradise,” along with the seemingly energetic northern half of the peninsula, held considerable appeal for soldiers and civilians in the South—who were bewildered by chaos and suffered from injustice and exploitation under Rhee. As a result, a series of military and civilian uprisings erupted, with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident being the largest military revolt among them.

    Returning to the film to trace clues: after Yeom Sang-jin’s guerrillas occupy Beolgyo, they enthusiastically contact other rebel forces while immediately launching a purge, subjecting local landlords, bureaucrats, military and police officers, and other anti-communist and pro-government figures to denunciations and executions. Except for Kim Sa-yong, the father of the protagonist Kim Beom-u (played by Ahn Sung-ki), who is spared because he once taught Yeom Sang-jin and helped support his schooling, all other landlords and pro-government anti-communist individuals who failed to flee are killed—over 100 people in total. For a single “eup,” this amounted to a brutal massacre.

    But within less than three days, government forces defeated the rebels holding Suncheon, and the Beolgyo guerrillas were forced to flee hastily—killing civilians perceived as hostile to the left before their retreat. When government troops, police, and militias returned to Beolgyo, they quickly launched retaliatory operations, slaughtering relatives of guerrillas and informants who had cooperated with them. Later, during a series of government military and police purges, many individuals accused of having had secret contact with guerrillas were also killed. At night, the left-wing guerrillas struck back in turn, raiding towns, executing informants, forcibly conscripting young men, and seizing cattle and grain.

    Such cruel cycles of mutual slaughter and retaliation were occurring throughout the peninsula from 1945 to the 1950s. On the surface, these killings stemmed from conflict between two regimes (the Kim Il-sung regime and the Rhee Syngman regime) and two ideologies (communism and feudal capitalism). But the more immediate cause lay in unequal distribution of wealth—especially land—which drove survival-based violence and created vicious cycles of hatred and retaliation.

The Land Issue: The Focal Point of Political Struggles and Ideological Confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, and the Root of Life-and-Death Struggles Among the People

  The land issue on the Korean Peninsula can be traced back to the feudal period of Joseon (here the term “feudal” follows Marxist historiography and related translations, same below). The feudal dynasty of Joseon, similar to China’s ancient dynasties, was also built upon the rule of the landlord class, and the dynasty primarily represented the interests of that class. However, compared with China, the feudal dynasty and entire traditional society of Joseon had an even more rigid structure. 

Joseon’s traditional culture, which inherited and modified Confucian culture from China, became more conservative and more strictly bound by ethical norms and hierarchical propriety. As a result, social classes became even more sharply divided. In ancient Joseon, the “yangban,” composed of aristocrats, officials, scholars, and military officers, were the privileged class of the nation and the ethnicity. They enjoyed far higher status and wealth than commoners, maintained hereditary succession, intermarried among themselves, and formed tightly knit cliques. The most important resource that demonstrated and secured their wealth and status was land.

    The yangban aristocracy controlled most of the land on the Korean Peninsula, but naturally did not cultivate it themselves. They hired tenant farmers to work the land, and these tenants gradually became servants attached to them. Although the peninsula’s tenant farmers were not officially labeled “serfs” like Russian peasants, the degree of oppression they suffered—especially their loss of personal freedom—was in some respects even worse than Russia’s “serfs,” and harsher than what Chinese peasants experienced. This was related to Joseon’s relatively stricter institutional and cultural system, as well as the peninsula’s limited land, dense population, low per-capita farmland, heavy farming pressure, and the lack of any real room for peasants to migrate.

    The yangban aristocrats lived lives of comfort or even indulgence, while peasants survived by cutting expenses and living on the brink of hardship. Whether peasants could live slightly better, or even simply have enough to eat, often depended on the personality or momentary mood of their yangban masters. Therefore, the conflict of interest between the aristocracy and the peasants was extremely severe, and society was highly stratified. Yet due to Joseon’s deep mastery of Confucian traditions and institutional structures adopted from China, the ruling class of Joseon succeeded in maintaining long-term stability. Even in rare instances of dynastic change (far fewer than in China), these were merely changes of power among the elite, with very few peasant revolts.

    Furthermore, although the yangban were extravagant, they also served as the backbone of the Joseon dynasty (and other local regimes on the peninsula), bearing responsibilities such as governing the state, maintaining order, developing the economy, promoting education and culture, undertaking construction projects, and defending against foreign invaders. They were the central force that enabled Goryeo/Joseon civilization to survive and flourish for centuries. It was precisely because they were supported by the peasants that they could escape the hardships of subsistence agriculture, avoid being burdened by farming labor, and instead concentrate on fulfilling their responsibilities.

    Most importantly, the Korean Peninsula is small in area and historically suffered repeated invasions—from Japan in the east, from Chinese dynasties in the west, and from nomadic or hunter-gatherer tribes in the north. Thus, internal unity was necessary to resist external aggression, which to some extent alleviated internal contradictions. In resisting foreign invasions, the yangban played a central role, and peasants could only unite and form military strength under yangban leadership. Under the monarch’s command, the two classes cooperated and enabled the relatively weak Joseon to withstand external threats and preserve statehood and civilization.

    However, this did not mean class contradictions did not exist. On the contrary, long-term oppression resulted in increasing class rigidity and intensifying class antagonism, with resentment accumulating over time. With the opening of the country in the 19th century and the influence of modern civilization, as well as the various impacts of Japanese colonial rule (which created a crisis of national survival while also weakening the rule of the Joseon aristocracy), the yangban system, along with the entire traditional social structure, faced fierce challenges. The Donghak Peasant Revolution, which occurred shortly before the First Sino-Japanese War, was a violent uprising of the Korean peasantry against internal and external oppression.

    After the peninsula became a full colony of Japan in the early 20th century, neither the Japanese colonizers nor Korean right-wing anti-Japanese nationalists and modernizers such as Syngman Rhee advocated thoroughly destroying the old system or the yangban aristocracy, nor did they intend to change land distribution or the broader relations of production. Instead, they actively sought to win over and utilize the old elite.

    For example, while Japanese colonial authorities killed, exiled, or expelled anti-Japanese yangban, they also supported and employed pro-Japanese yangban, transferring the land of the former to the latter. Korean peasants thus suffered dual oppression—from Japanese colonizers and from pro-Japanese yangban aristocrats. And right-wing nationalists represented by Syngman Rhee placed national liberation from Japan above all else, but had no intention of liberating the peasants. Instead, they likewise sought to win over yangban and other landlords and capitalists (after coming to power, the Rhee regime even harmed peasant interests to please the landlord class, which will be discussed later).

    The only forces that firmly advocated completely abolishing yangban privileges, dismantling the traditional social structure, granting peasants and other oppressed groups full citizenship, and equal distribution of wealth were the emerging groups of Korean socialists/communists. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, socialists in Korea were extremely marginalized and merely one branch within the broader nationalist movement. Moreover, due to the peninsula’s small population and limited social and cultural infrastructure, most Korean socialists operated in China, Japan, or Russia, with many holding foreign citizenship rather than Korean citizenship.

    After the victory of the Russian October Revolution and the establishment and rise of the Chinese Communist Party, many Korean socialists in Russia and China joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the CCP. Compared with right-wing nationalists like Syngman Rhee—who were also active abroad but maintained closer ties with anti-colonial movements inside the peninsula (Rhee and others were active mainly in the United States, Western Europe, and Kuomintang-controlled China)—the left-wing socialists remained relatively marginal both abroad and within Korea. For example, the March First Movement—marking the beginning of modern independence struggles on the peninsula—though influenced by the ideology of national self-determination and liberation, was led by traditional landlord elites (yangban) and emergent bourgeois figures (the peasants who joined were merely followers under their landlords’ orders). Its goals were national independence, not socialism or communism.

    Even so, some anti-imperialist and anti-colonial socialists remained active on the peninsula, the most prominent being Pak Hon-yong, who later became the actual leader of the South Korean Workers’ Party. Among the core figures of the later North Korean regime, Pak Hon-yong was the only one who had been long active on the peninsula during the colonial period (others such as Kim Il-sung, Kim Chwae-hyŏk, and Heo Ga-i were mainly active abroad in China or the Soviet Union). The “provincial party,” “county party,” and guerrilla forces mentioned in the film all belonged to the South Korean Workers’ Party established by Pak Hon-yong. It was through the persistent struggle of Pak Hon-yong and others on the peninsula—including enduring imprisonment and torture—that socialist ideology and related movements took root among grassroots populations, forming the foundation for both the establishment of the North Korean regime and the left-wing resistance under the South Korean Rhee government.

    The main promise made by Pak Hon-yong and other socialist/communist activists to mobilize peasants for revolution was the redistribution of land—confiscating all land from the landlord class without compensation and dividing it among peasants, realizing “land to the tiller” and equal prosperity. Of course, they also preached communist ideology to peasants, denouncing the evils of feudal Confucian norms and the injustice of hierarchical systems, and claiming they would establish an earthly paradise of equality. 

Although these ideas contradicted the education instilled in peninsula residents for thousands of years, they nevertheless resonated with many long-oppressed peasants, especially poor tenant farmers. Meanwhile, some intellectuals from relatively affluent or even aristocratic backgrounds were drawn to left-wing ideals out of pure idealism and joined the revolutionary cause at the risk of their lives.

    The left-wing guerrilla forces in the film are precisely those directed and commanded by the South Korean Workers’ Party. In their internal review after retreating from Beolgyo, when Ahn Chang-min, an intellectual, criticized the party’s mistakes, Yeom Sang-jin fiercely demanded that he stop criticizing the party, because “the Party is always sacred and wise; all criticism of the Party is wrong.” This clearly reveals the Party’s strict control over revolutionaries and the severity of party discipline. It also shows that the communist forces in Korea at that time had already developed strong tendencies toward dogmatism and extremism.

    The background composition of the guerrilla core members reflected the typical makeup of participants in the left-wing movement on the peninsula. Yeom Sang-jin was born into a poor farming family, entered the teachers’ college through his diligence, came into contact with left-wing thought, and—combined with his personal and family suffering—became awakened and turned into a revolutionary. 

Ahn Chang-min represented upper-class intellectuals who leaned left; he devoted himself to the left-wing revolution purely for ideals, not personal gain, even betraying his own class background for those ideals. Another figure, Jeong Ha-seop (the guerrilla messenger who gradually develops feelings for the shaman Sohwa), came from a landlord family and, driven by idealism, also became a “progressive youth” who rebelled against his class. But he was younger than Ahn Chang-min and even more passionate and pure in his revolutionary zeal.

    Most other guerrillas were from poor peasant backgrounds. Many joined simply to obtain land or because they could no longer endure landlords’ oppression. For example, the tenant farmers who killed a landlord surnamed So—who had tried to sell land to avoid redistribution—and then defected to the guerrillas, were typical. Many others were forcibly conscripted or semi-forcibly coerced into joining, entering the “revolution” in a confused state.

    Professional revolutionaries as leaders, intellectuals as the backbone, and peasants as the main body—this was the basic composition of the left-wing forces on the Korean Peninsula (the same was true in other agricultural countries such as China and India). Intellectuals joined for the ideal of universal equality, peasants joined to gain their own land, and all aspired to a distant yet beautiful “communist paradise.”

    The rise of left-wing forces advocating land revolution naturally provoked fear among the traditional landlord class. Whether pro-Japanese yangban or nationalist landlords, capitalists, and intellectuals, all intensely hated communist forces. The Japanese colonial authorities violently suppressed left-wing movements—Pak Hon-yong was repeatedly arrested and tortured, once nearly driven insane, and later released and escaped to China only through extensive rescue efforts. Right-wing nationalists led by Syngman Rhee likewise refused to cooperate with the left (and certainly not with communists like Pak Hon-yong or Kim Il-sung), viewing one another as enemies.

    The confrontation and conflict between the left and right, between aristocrats and commoners, and between landlords and tenant farmers continued from the colonial era into the post-liberation period, and became even more violent due to the division of the peninsula—resulting in massive massacres and warfare.

**Iran**

Right now there are major protests in Iran which have spread to over seventeen cities. Citizens are directly engaging in combat with regime forces and taking prisoners. The protests are lead by the younger generations who want freedom from the theocratic Islamic regime.

The Islamic Republic of Iran has been crushing its people with religious regulations, for example arresting women who refuse to cover their heads. Some of[ these women have died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini) in custody after being arrested by morality police. Now women are marching in the streets refusing to wear their hijabs at great personal risk.

The Islamic government took power in 1979 after overthrowing the government of the Pahlavi Dynasty. Supreme authority fell to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini, a Muslim cleric. ISKCON wishes it was as successful.

**The Ayatollah of Rock ’n’ Rolla**

Prabhupada dreamed of establishing Krishna Consciousness monarchies, benevolent dictatorships, overthrowing all other forms of government, including democracy. Had this project been successful he personally would have been established as the supreme ruler much like Iran's Ayatollah.

When devotees established temples and preaching centers around the world, they did so as soldiers, building bases for global regime change. Cult members seriously believed this would happen in their lifetimes. They were waiting for Krishna to magically make it all happen.

When this didn't happen, devotees put their hopes in nuclear war. They believed the world would be destroyed in a nuclear holocaust and devotees would emerge from hiding to take control.

**Meet The New Boss**

ISKCON is arguably more extreme than the Shia Islamic rulers of Iran. Hare Krishna's reject all modern technology as demonic and want to reduce the world to nothing but agriculture. Devotees are hypocritically obsessed with technology. They justify it by saying they are using technology to conquer the world, after which they will get rid of technology.

They advocate for ""spiritual communism"" modeled on an idealized version of Indian village life circa 500 BCE. Our technologies and our rights will be stripped from us. When we see the light, we will willingly become happy peasants, chanting Hare Krishna while we work the land. I imagine all land will eventually belong to ISKCON, which will extract 50% of our earnings. Prabhupada said.

Of course, ISKCON members and their descendants will not be peasants. They will the new Brahman class, turbaned Maharajas who live like fat greedy Zamindars; indoctrinating others into submission and living in luxury.

**Hippie Hypocrites**

Boomer Prabhupada disciples would love to see places like India become theocratic dictatorships. However, living in abject poverty under religious repression is not for them. it is for others. They prefer to live comfortably in the West with their modern conveniences, their independence, their 401K's, their healthcare, their properties and their wealth.

They will fly in on airplanes, and visit the theocracy to be worshiped as senior devotees, carried on palanquins, fanned with chamaras by wide eyed brainwashed servants. They will demonstrate their purity by complaining about how degraded they find the West, sharing stories of their glory days as radical revolutionaries working to tear it all down.

**Real Revolution**

If ISKCON was somehow successful at taking over the world, how long would such a hypocritical and abusive regime survive? Even in traditionally Hindu dominant countries like Nepal or India it wouldn't last a year. Any such regime would be violently deposed.

The people of Iran have lived under similar totalitarian conditions for fifty years and they are willing to die in the streets to bring it down.",https://i.redd.it/dnydb1qgi4bg1.jpeg

Upon its release in 1994, the film won more than ten awards, including Best Film at the Blue Dragon Awards, the highest honor in Korean cinema, marking a milestone in Korean film history. 

The publication of the complete version of the novel, as well as the production and release of the film, all took place several years after Korea’s democratization in 1987. For this reason, the film also reflects the social sentiments of the time—when the right-wing military dictatorship had ended, pluralistic democratic politics was beginning to take shape, and Korean society, especially the intellectual community, was reexamining history, calling for humanitarianism, and experiencing the rise of center-left ideologies.

    Yet what the film reflects goes far beyond these aspects; it carries even richer and more complex meanings and values. To explore these, one must examine and analyze the detailed content of the novel and the film one by one.


The Repeated “Changes of Flags” in Beolgyo-eup, South Jeolla Province: Beginning with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident

    At the beginning of the film, subtitles explain the historical background of The Taebaek Mountains: the U.S.–Soviet Cold War and ideological confrontation led to the division and conflict of the Korean Peninsula. The melancholy opening theme and the scene of a flock of geese circling above the Taebaek Mountains foreshadow the tragic nature of this story.

    The film opens with the ringing of telephones in the police station and the youth corps breaking the nighttime quiet of Beolgyo. Yeom Sang-gu, the inspector general of the youth corps who is playing cards, and Nam In-tae, the police chief on duty at the station, hear news of a revolt in Yeosu and the fall of Suncheon. They immediately flee Beolgyo with their men. Meanwhile, Yeom Sang-gu’s elder brother, Yeom Sang-jin—who had joined the South Korean Workers’ Party (the South Korean branch of the Workers’ Party of Korea, conducting underground activities in areas controlled by the Rhee Syngman regime)—leads a guerrilla unit under the command of the South Jeolla Provincial Party Committee, raising the North Korean flag and occupying Beolgyo without a fight.

    The real historical background of this story is the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident of October 1948. Anyone with some knowledge of modern Korean Peninsula history will be familiar with this event. It was the largest military rebellion to occur after the establishment of the Rhee Syngman regime, which governed the southern side of the 38th parallel, and it had major implications for the peninsula’s situation. Before the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident, the Rhee regime’s rule was relatively stable, and Kim Il-sung had not yet decided to invade the South. But after the incident, Kim Il-sung perceived conflict within Rhee’s government and widespread social unrest, and consequently decided to march south to unify the peninsula.

    Indeed, the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident was a concentrated reflection of the unstable military morale, fragmented public sentiment, and social turbulence in the southern half of the peninsula (for convenience, hereafter abbreviated as “South Korea,” even though some events occurred before the formal founding of the Republic of Korea). The immediate trigger for the incident was the refusal of certain Korean troops stationed in Yeosu to suppress the civilian uprising in Jeju. And the cause of the Jeju uprising itself was the military and police suppression of demonstrators. Both the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion and the Jeju uprising were supported and encouraged by the South Korean Workers’ Party.

    The fundamental reason the South Korean Workers’ Party was able to successfully incite revolt was the severe social contradictions in South Korea and the authoritarian and arbitrary rule of the Rhee Syngman regime (these two points will be discussed in later sections). 

Meanwhile, the left-wing forces advocating the establishment of a “communist paradise,” along with the seemingly energetic northern half of the peninsula, held considerable appeal for soldiers and civilians in the South—who were bewildered by chaos and suffered from injustice and exploitation under Rhee. As a result, a series of military and civilian uprisings erupted, with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident being the largest military revolt among them.

    Returning to the film to trace clues: after Yeom Sang-jin’s guerrillas occupy Beolgyo, they enthusiastically contact other rebel forces while immediately launching a purge, subjecting local landlords, bureaucrats, military and police officers, and other anti-communist and pro-government figures to denunciations and executions. Except for Kim Sa-yong, the father of the protagonist Kim Beom-u (played by Ahn Sung-ki), who is spared because he once taught Yeom Sang-jin and helped support his schooling, all other landlords and pro-government anti-communist individuals who failed to flee are killed—over 100 people in total. For a single “eup,” this amounted to a brutal massacre.

    But within less than three days, government forces defeated the rebels holding Suncheon, and the Beolgyo guerrillas were forced to flee hastily—killing civilians perceived as hostile to the left before their retreat. When government troops, police, and militias returned to Beolgyo, they quickly launched retaliatory operations, slaughtering relatives of guerrillas and informants who had cooperated with them. Later, during a series of government military and police purges, many individuals accused of having had secret contact with guerrillas were also killed. At night, the left-wing guerrillas struck back in turn, raiding towns, executing informants, forcibly conscripting young men, and seizing cattle and grain.

    Such cruel cycles of mutual slaughter and retaliation were occurring throughout the peninsula from 1945 to the 1950s. On the surface, these killings stemmed from conflict between two regimes (the Kim Il-sung regime and the Rhee Syngman regime) and two ideologies (communism and feudal capitalism). But the more immediate cause lay in unequal distribution of wealth—especially land—which drove survival-based violence and created vicious cycles of hatred and retaliation.

The Land Issue: The Focal Point of Political Struggles and Ideological Confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, and the Root of Life-and-Death Struggles Among the People

  The land issue on the Korean Peninsula can be traced back to the feudal period of Joseon (here the term “feudal” follows Marxist historiography and related translations, same below). The feudal dynasty of Joseon, similar to China’s ancient dynasties, was also built upon the rule of the landlord class, and the dynasty primarily represented the interests of that class. However, compared with China, the feudal dynasty and entire traditional society of Joseon had an even more rigid structure. 

Joseon’s traditional culture, which inherited and modified Confucian culture from China, became more conservative and more strictly bound by ethical norms and hierarchical propriety. As a result, social classes became even more sharply divided. In ancient Joseon, the “yangban,” composed of aristocrats, officials, scholars, and military officers, were the privileged class of the nation and the ethnicity. They enjoyed far higher status and wealth than commoners, maintained hereditary succession, intermarried among themselves, and formed tightly knit cliques. The most important resource that demonstrated and secured their wealth and status was land.

    The yangban aristocracy controlled most of the land on the Korean Peninsula, but naturally did not cultivate it themselves. They hired tenant farmers to work the land, and these tenants gradually became servants attached to them. Although the peninsula’s tenant farmers were not officially labeled “serfs” like Russian peasants, the degree of oppression they suffered—especially their loss of personal freedom—was in some respects even worse than Russia’s “serfs,” and harsher than what Chinese peasants experienced. This was related to Joseon’s relatively stricter institutional and cultural system, as well as the peninsula’s limited land, dense population, low per-capita farmland, heavy farming pressure, and the lack of any real room for peasants to migrate.

    The yangban aristocrats lived lives of comfort or even indulgence, while peasants survived by cutting expenses and living on the brink of hardship. Whether peasants could live slightly better, or even simply have enough to eat, often depended on the personality or momentary mood of their yangban masters. Therefore, the conflict of interest between the aristocracy and the peasants was extremely severe, and society was highly stratified. Yet due to Joseon’s deep mastery of Confucian traditions and institutional structures adopted from China, the ruling class of Joseon succeeded in maintaining long-term stability. Even in rare instances of dynastic change (far fewer than in China), these were merely changes of power among the elite, with very few peasant revolts.

    Furthermore, although the yangban were extravagant, they also served as the backbone of the Joseon dynasty (and other local regimes on the peninsula), bearing responsibilities such as governing the state, maintaining order, developing the economy, promoting education and culture, undertaking construction projects, and defending against foreign invaders. They were the central force that enabled Goryeo/Joseon civilization to survive and flourish for centuries. It was precisely because they were supported by the peasants that they could escape the hardships of subsistence agriculture, avoid being burdened by farming labor, and instead concentrate on fulfilling their responsibilities.

    Most importantly, the Korean Peninsula is small in area and historically suffered repeated invasions—from Japan in the east, from Chinese dynasties in the west, and from nomadic or hunter-gatherer tribes in the north. Thus, internal unity was necessary to resist external aggression, which to some extent alleviated internal contradictions. In resisting foreign invasions, the yangban played a central role, and peasants could only unite and form military strength under yangban leadership. Under the monarch’s command, the two classes cooperated and enabled the relatively weak Joseon to withstand external threats and preserve statehood and civilization.

    However, this did not mean class contradictions did not exist. On the contrary, long-term oppression resulted in increasing class rigidity and intensifying class antagonism, with resentment accumulating over time. With the opening of the country in the 19th century and the influence of modern civilization, as well as the various impacts of Japanese colonial rule (which created a crisis of national survival while also weakening the rule of the Joseon aristocracy), the yangban system, along with the entire traditional social structure, faced fierce challenges. The Donghak Peasant Revolution, which occurred shortly before the First Sino-Japanese War, was a violent uprising of the Korean peasantry against internal and external oppression.

    After the peninsula became a full colony of Japan in the early 20th century, neither the Japanese colonizers nor Korean right-wing anti-Japanese nationalists and modernizers such as Syngman Rhee advocated thoroughly destroying the old system or the yangban aristocracy, nor did they intend to change land distribution or the broader relations of production. Instead, they actively sought to win over and utilize the old elite.

    For example, while Japanese colonial authorities killed, exiled, or expelled anti-Japanese yangban, they also supported and employed pro-Japanese yangban, transferring the land of the former to the latter. Korean peasants thus suffered dual oppression—from Japanese colonizers and from pro-Japanese yangban aristocrats. And right-wing nationalists represented by Syngman Rhee placed national liberation from Japan above all else, but had no intention of liberating the peasants. Instead, they likewise sought to win over yangban and other landlords and capitalists (after coming to power, the Rhee regime even harmed peasant interests to please the landlord class, which will be discussed later).

    The only forces that firmly advocated completely abolishing yangban privileges, dismantling the traditional social structure, granting peasants and other oppressed groups full citizenship, and equal distribution of wealth were the emerging groups of Korean socialists/communists. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, socialists in Korea were extremely marginalized and merely one branch within the broader nationalist movement. Moreover, due to the peninsula’s small population and limited social and cultural infrastructure, most Korean socialists operated in China, Japan, or Russia, with many holding foreign citizenship rather than Korean citizenship.

    After the victory of the Russian October Revolution and the establishment and rise of the Chinese Communist Party, many Korean socialists in Russia and China joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the CCP. Compared with right-wing nationalists like Syngman Rhee—who were also active abroad but maintained closer ties with anti-colonial movements inside the peninsula (Rhee and others were active mainly in the United States, Western Europe, and Kuomintang-controlled China)—the left-wing socialists remained relatively marginal both abroad and within Korea. For example, the March First Movement—marking the beginning of modern independence struggles on the peninsula—though influenced by the ideology of national self-determination and liberation, was led by traditional landlord elites (yangban) and emergent bourgeois figures (the peasants who joined were merely followers under their landlords’ orders). Its goals were national independence, not socialism or communism.

    Even so, some anti-imperialist and anti-colonial socialists remained active on the peninsula, the most prominent being Pak Hon-yong, who later became the actual leader of the South Korean Workers’ Party. Among the core figures of the later North Korean regime, Pak Hon-yong was the only one who had been long active on the peninsula during the colonial period (others such as Kim Il-sung, Kim Chwae-hyŏk, and Heo Ga-i were mainly active abroad in China or the Soviet Union). The “provincial party,” “county party,” and guerrilla forces mentioned in the film all belonged to the South Korean Workers’ Party established by Pak Hon-yong. It was through the persistent struggle of Pak Hon-yong and others on the peninsula—including enduring imprisonment and torture—that socialist ideology and related movements took root among grassroots populations, forming the foundation for both the establishment of the North Korean regime and the left-wing resistance under the South Korean Rhee government.

    The main promise made by Pak Hon-yong and other socialist/communist activists to mobilize peasants for revolution was the redistribution of land—confiscating all land from the landlord class without compensation and dividing it among peasants, realizing “land to the tiller” and equal prosperity. Of course, they also preached communist ideology to peasants, denouncing the evils of feudal Confucian norms and the injustice of hierarchical systems, and claiming they would establish an earthly paradise of equality. 

Although these ideas contradicted the education instilled in peninsula residents for thousands of years, they nevertheless resonated with many long-oppressed peasants, especially poor tenant farmers. Meanwhile, some intellectuals from relatively affluent or even aristocratic backgrounds were drawn to left-wing ideals out of pure idealism and joined the revolutionary cause at the risk of their lives.

    The left-wing guerrilla forces in the film are precisely those directed and commanded by the South Korean Workers’ Party. In their internal review after retreating from Beolgyo, when Ahn Chang-min, an intellectual, criticized the party’s mistakes, Yeom Sang-jin fiercely demanded that he stop criticizing the party, because “the Party is always sacred and wise; all criticism of the Party is wrong.” This clearly reveals the Party’s strict control over revolutionaries and the severity of party discipline. It also shows that the communist forces in Korea at that time had already developed strong tendencies toward dogmatism and extremism.

    The background composition of the guerrilla core members reflected the typical makeup of participants in the left-wing movement on the peninsula. Yeom Sang-jin was born into a poor farming family, entered the teachers’ college through his diligence, came into contact with left-wing thought, and—combined with his personal and family suffering—became awakened and turned into a revolutionary. 

Ahn Chang-min represented upper-class intellectuals who leaned left; he devoted himself to the left-wing revolution purely for ideals, not personal gain, even betraying his own class background for those ideals. Another figure, Jeong Ha-seop (the guerrilla messenger who gradually develops feelings for the shaman Sohwa), came from a landlord family and, driven by idealism, also became a “progressive youth” who rebelled against his class. But he was younger than Ahn Chang-min and even more passionate and pure in his revolutionary zeal.

    Most other guerrillas were from poor peasant backgrounds. Many joined simply to obtain land or because they could no longer endure landlords’ oppression. For example, the tenant farmers who killed a landlord surnamed So—who had tried to sell land to avoid redistribution—and then defected to the guerrillas, were typical. Many others were forcibly conscripted or semi-forcibly coerced into joining, entering the “revolution” in a confused state.

    Professional revolutionaries as leaders, intellectuals as the backbone, and peasants as the main body—this was the basic composition of the left-wing forces on the Korean Peninsula (the same was true in other agricultural countries such as China and India). Intellectuals joined for the ideal of universal equality, peasants joined to gain their own land, and all aspired to a distant yet beautiful “communist paradise.”

    The rise of left-wing forces advocating land revolution naturally provoked fear among the traditional landlord class. Whether pro-Japanese yangban or nationalist landlords, capitalists, and intellectuals, all intensely hated communist forces. The Japanese colonial authorities violently suppressed left-wing movements—Pak Hon-yong was repeatedly arrested and tortured, once nearly driven insane, and later released and escaped to China only through extensive rescue efforts. Right-wing nationalists led by Syngman Rhee likewise refused to cooperate with the left (and certainly not with communists like Pak Hon-yong or Kim Il-sung), viewing one another as enemies.

    The confrontation and conflict between the left and right, between aristocrats and commoners, and between landlords and tenant farmers continued from the colonial era into the post-liberation period, and became even more violent due to the division of the peninsula—resulting in massive massacres and warfare.

"A Letter to Hong Kong Leftist Civil Rights Leader Mr. Leung Kwok-hung(History of Mainland–Hong Kong leftist movements, plight of workers and the vulnerable, national destiny, and hopes for the future)",1q2q9fo,3,8,2026-01-03 09:20:00,Slow-Property5895,CapitalismVSocialism,"


(On the history of leftist revolutions, national history, injustice and the suffering of vulnerable groups, the historical connections between the mainland and Hong Kong, the distortion and misuse of socialism/communism, populism, June Fourth, the pursuit of democracy, the transformations of Chinese liberals, the future of the mainland and Hong Kong, and personal reflections and expectations)


Respected Mr. Leung Kwok-hung:

I am Wang Qingmin, a writer living in Europe. During my middle school years, I already heard your name and learned about your deeds through media, newspapers, and the internet. Whether it was your struggle for the rights of the hardworking laborers and the suffering underclass, your more than thirty years of persistence in calling for the vindication of June Fourth and accountability for Beijing’s massacre, your outcry for justice for the Chinese people killed by Japanese invaders in the Nanjing Massacre, your fundraising for disaster relief for the people of Sichuan during the Wenchuan Earthquake, or your support for many political prisoners and resisters in mainland China, your sense of justice, courage, and action have always earned my deepest admiration. I have long wished to meet you, but unfortunately have never had the opportunity.

Five years ago, when I went to Hong Kong for some personal matters and political appeals, I once went to the League of Social Democrats in hopes of visiting you, but I did not find you there. A few days later, when I went to the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government to “scout the site” in preparation for a protest, I happened to see you and other comrades of the League of Social Democrats engaged in protest. But at that time many journalists and police surrounded you, and you left quickly. I also worried about disrupting your protest and the media’s interviews, so I could not speak with you, and in the end only watched you leave.

Later, after experiencing various things and traveling through many places, I left mainland China and came to Europe. Before I had even fully settled down, I heard about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Movement that had erupted in Hong Kong. In just over a year, Hong Kong’s political opposition was wiped out, and civil society was completely destroyed. And you, too, were imprisoned. This was something I had never expected.

In these years, whether in the unexpected twists and changes of my own life, or in the shifting circumstances I have seen and heard in mainland China, Hong Kong, and the world, I have come to understand fully the impermanence of life and of worldly affairs.

Yet in this ever-changing world, what is needed even more is sincere perseverance. And you are exactly such an exemplar, one who for decades has upheld ideals, abided by conscience, and defended justice. I have read about your life and many of your deeds, and I know that from the British colonial era you were already committed to the socialist movement, loving your country and your people, and serving as a vanguard of Hong Kong’s leftist revolution. The “Revolutionary Marxist League” in which you participated was one of the very few Hong Kong political organizations of that era that clearly opposed colonialism, capitalism, and conservatism.

After the 1967 Uprising (the 1967 Riots—which, in fact, we should more properly call an uprising; although the uprising was exploited and harmed some innocent people—this indeed requires apology and repentance—it was still, on the whole, a revolutionary struggle against colonialism and corruption, in pursuit of justice) was suppressed, Hong Kong’s leftist movement fell into long dormancy. Yet you, unafraid of the high-pressure authoritarianism of the British colonial authorities and of the Chinese Communist regime that colluded with them, still held fast to your ideals, even moving against the tide—speaking up and fighting for laborers, women, and the underclass, nearly single-handedly carving out in Hong Kong a new path of “continuing revolution” that was both radical and yet peaceful and sustainable. Whether denouncing the dictatorship of the CCP, or criticizing the Hong Kong establishment (especially the Liberal Party and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong) for disregarding the rights and interests of the common people, you always spoke with reason and power, forcing them to make some concessions, giving up part of their vested interests in order to placate laborers and the underclass.

It is precisely because of your presence that Hong Kong’s workers and underclass people have had support and hope, allowing this city—steeped in the stench of brutal capitalism and marked by vast disparities between rich and poor—to still let shine, through its cracks, the rays of social justice and the light of equality and fraternity.

Even more worthy of admiration is that you are not one of those reverse nationalists who abandon the nation and the people for leftist revolution and internationalism. On the contrary, your ardent and sincere patriotism far surpasses that of the overwhelming majority of mainland and Hong Kong politicians and intellectuals. Whether in the Diaoyu Islands protection movement, in denouncing the Nanjing Massacre, in pursuing accountability for Japan’s war crimes and forced labor, in criticizing the crimes of Western imperial powers, or in exposing the evil deeds of the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong and their discrimination and oppression of Hong Kong people, you have always been passionate and sincere, never wavering over decades. Your sense of justice, your courage, and your national spirit make me, like a small blade of grass in the mountains, look up to the sunrise in the east, receiving lessons for the soul and strength in justice.

The Sino-British negotiations and Hong Kong’s return were supposed to be another stage victory of the national democratic revolution. But the motherland to which Hong Kong returned was not truly a national democratic state, but rather one that was authoritarian and dictatorial, marked by brutal capitalism, collusion with conservative and reactionary forces of various countries. This was not only the case in Deng Xiaoping’s era—it had already been so in Mao Zedong’s era. Whether it was Mao’s “thanks to Japan’s invasion,” his meeting with Nixon, or his kindness to Pinochet and other Latin American right-wing military dictators burdened with blood debts, the CCP had long since betrayed the nation and the people, and abandoned the ideals of revolution. Deng Xiaoping’s era not only continued this, but went further in launching the Tiananmen Massacre, crushing the Chinese nation’s century-long democratic dream.

After Hong Kong’s return, apart from hypocritically awarding a few small honors to certain people from the 1967 Uprising as consolation, the CCP completely tilted toward the powerful and the capitalists. The CCP and the Hong Kong government were in fact even more pro-power and pro-business than the British colonial government. The living conditions of laborers and the underclass did not see systemic improvement; Hong Kong remained a paradise of neoliberalism and a filthy marketplace for deals among global elites. While Hong Kong laborers and maids curled up in “coffin homes,” the likes of Jasper Tsang feasted and toasted in “Banquet House.” And the straight-line distance between the two may not have been more than 500 meters.

In dealing with Japan’s invasion and the crimes of Western colonialism, the CCP on the one hand exploited these to rally and buy off the hearts of the people, resisting the infiltration of the West and universal values, but on the other hand suppressed genuine reflection, criticism, and accountability regarding Japan’s crimes and imperialist colonialism—using false nationalism to stifle true nationalism, constructing the “Chinese Nation” as a replacement to blur and dilute the real and powerful cohesion, unity, and emotion of the Han nation, in order to control the Han people and, along with them, all the other peoples of the country. In foreign relations, whether toward Japan, Britain, the U.S., or the imperialist powers, the CCP has always belittled them in words but courted them in reality, seeking their favor and exchanging it for their support of CCP rule in China, willingly acting as the “territorial guard” for foreign powers. Meanwhile, the people of Hong Kong and mainland China, especially the mainlanders, have suffered the dual exploitation of the CCP elites and foreign colonizers, directly and indirectly. Whether the “Friendship Stores” of the Mao era or the “sweatshops” of the Deng era, both reflected that the nature of the “semi-colonial and semi-feudal society” had not changed.

In 2018, the Jasic workers’ struggle in Shenzhen was one of the very few large-scale collective resistances in China since June Fourth, and also the peak of China’s labor movement, demonstrating the courage of the Chinese working class and the solidarity of workers and students. But the Jasic workers’ movement was ultimately brutally suppressed by the CCP regime, with many workers and young students arrested, and dissemination both offline and online prohibited. This once again exposed the reactionary essence of the CCP regime as one belonging to a privileged bourgeoisie.

In the Huawei Meng Wanzhou incident, the CCP did not hesitate to take foreigners hostage, destroying Sino-Canadian/Sino-American relations to save this “princeling,” yet turned a blind eye to the arrests of Hong Kong youths Kwok Siu-kit and Yim Man-wah, who protested at Japan’s Yasukuni Shrine. This once again proved in fact that the CCP regime is one that only defends the interests of its privileged class, disregarding national interests and the rights of ordinary citizens—an “internal colonial” regime. (And at the time of the Meng Wanzhou incident, when a Huawei executive was arrested in Poland, both Huawei and the Chinese government quickly “cut ties” with him, which likewise reflected this discriminatory double standard of the CCP.)

Such a “motherland”—is it still possible to love? Although the regime and the people are two different things, one has to admit that at least among China’s vested-interest class, those with discourse power, and highly educated middle-aged and young men in China, whether supporters of the CCP establishment or anti-CCP opposition, whether nominally leftist or rightist, most are in fact either social Darwinists, reverse nationalists, or false nationalists—or even a combination of these (including some of those whom you once supported and helped, and for whom you once raised your voice in front of the Liaison Office). They are no different from, or are simply the mirror image of, what the CCP openly advocates or tacitly encourages. With such a state and such citizens, it is truly difficult to “love.”

And Hong Kong, in recent years, has also become increasingly “mainlandized.” The Hong Kong establishment is highly bound together with the CCP’s privileged class, and the suppression and erosion of Hong Kong people’s freedoms grows heavier by the day. Compared with the British colonial government, which at least spoke somewhat of modern capitalist humanitarianism (though in essence hypocritical, limited, and aimed at maintaining bourgeois and colonial rule), the CCP practices survival-of-the-fittest social Darwinism, using “patriotism” as a fig leaf while lacking genuine patriotism, with hypocrisy and shamelessness surpassing even that of the British colonial authorities. As for the promised pursuit of building a “new democratic society” and a “communist society,” those ideals were long since thrown to the winds.

Yet in such a country and city, under such an ideology and reality, you have nevertheless remained unchanged for decades, holding to the revolutionary beginning and ideals, unceasingly fighting for social justice. In the Legislative Council, before the Liaison Office, in Central, in Victoria Park, you have time and again fiercely denounced the ugly deeds of those arrogant scoundrels, with unrestrained power; you have spoken for laborers and women, supported political prisoners and rights defenders in the mainland, with sincerity and strength; for decades you have tirelessly rushed about, navigating among various powerful forces and complex gray networks of interests, striving to win discourse power and legitimate benefits for those who cannot speak or resist, step by step, grounded and practical.

You have also endured prison many times for your resistance. When I was detained in a police station and placed in a mental hospital in Hong Kong due to protest activities and self-harm, I could hardly endure even just a few hours in the sweltering environment of the Western District Police Station detention cell. It was difficult even to softly hum the “Internationale.” With that experience, I can even more profoundly understand and admire your resilience, bravery, and greatness.

For your words, deeds, and spiritual qualities, there are no words left to describe in further praise—everything has already been said, and no more can be added.

After the Anti-Extradition Movement and the crackdown of 2019–2020, the CCP regime completely tore up the contract of “Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong, with a high degree of autonomy,” abandoned the promise of “fifty years unchanged,” and took the opportunity to completely crush the political opposition and indeed all of Hong Kong’s civil society. Not only was violent resistance suppressed, but even resistance through peaceful means such as parliament and demonstrations was no longer permitted. This reveals the utter madness of Xi’s CCP, and also reflects the cruel, dark, and suffocating reality of today’s Hong Kong and all of China.

And it is not only China—the entire global situation makes one feel uneasy, even pessimistic and pained. The progressive waves that once swept the world—whether Roosevelt’s New Deal, the movements of 1968, the Carnation Revolution and the third wave of democratization, the rise of the Latin American left, the Arab Spring… all have passed and receded (though with some partial returns, such as Lula defeating Bolsonaro in Brazil). Today’s world is one of rampant right-wing conservative populism—from America’s reactionary forces of Trump-Pence-Pompeo-DeSantis, to India’s Modi, Hungary’s Orbán, Russia’s Putin, and even Japan’s Shinzo Abe and Fumio Kishida—regimes are undermining world peace and progress, and oppressed, vulnerable nations and peoples suffer even more.

In Hong Kong too, there emerged a strong localist populist force, which split the pan-democratic camp, intensified conflicts between the mainland and Hong Kong, and together with Xi’s regime broke the tacit understandings between the CCP and Hong Kong’s non-establishment, leading to a series of violent conflicts during the Anti-Extradition Movement. Of course, they should not be overly blamed—the CCP was the greatest culprit. But Hong Kong’s localists and the “brave fighters,” though their actions can be understood and sympathized with, were ultimately narrow and shortsighted, unlikely to achieve Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy, and deviating from universal justice. I respect them, but I also hope even more that they will in the end stand on the same front as Hong Kong’s pan-democrats and the oppressed people of mainland China.

Even more tragic is that the laboring class—which once represented the vanguard of advanced productive forces and new civilization—has undergone a split, with part of it becoming instead an important component of right-wing conservative populist forces. On the one hand, they strive for their own rights and benefits, but on the other hand they oppose women’s rights, LGBT rights, the rights of minorities and other vulnerable groups, even opposing workers in other countries gaining benefits, and engaging in competition and harm among workers themselves, while believing in various conspiracy theories and hate-inciting propaganda, becoming narrow, anti-intellectual, and blindly obedient. Although not all laborers are like this, at least a considerable portion of workers (whether in the West or in the Third World) have indeed degenerated.

In fact, the working class has always had a dual or even multiple nature. On the one hand, workers are the core of productive forces, the backbone of production relations, the main force of human industrialization, modernization, and civilization. Without workers, there would be no prosperous and great world today. On the other hand, the working class also has selfishness, ignorance, and narrowness. In China, the “worker aristocrats” of state-owned enterprises in the Mao era had already degenerated into an exploiting class and rent-seekers, whose value creation fell far short of their income, and who became a conservative and stubborn force obstructing reform. As for the lower and middle workers, their labor and contributions deserve respect, sympathy, and support, but at least a considerable portion of them are misogynistic, hostile to the weak (even though they themselves are weak), exclusionary of the different, cruel and violent, anti-intellectual and superstitious. Even though these problems are fundamentally the result of oppression, brainwashing, and manipulation by the ruling class, they must still bear part of the blame themselves.

Even in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the working class had these problems, but compared with feudal conservative forces and the primitive barbaric bourgeoisie, the conservatism and narrowness of workers were not so prominent. At that time, they even converged with progressive currents such as feminism, and throughout most of the 20th century they were part of the progressive forces, standing together with feminists, the disabled, minorities, and others. But after a century, with the development of the times and the reshuffling of forces, at least part of the laborers have instead regressed to a level of reaction comparable to the workers of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan under the Emperor and the military. When Brazilian truck drivers abandoned the Workers’ Party and instead fervently supported the far-right fascist Bolsonaro, calling for the return of military dictatorship, this most clearly revealed such a tragic degeneration.

Yet this degeneration is not entirely incomprehensible. Various forms of exploitation, oppression, deception, and violence place workers in pain and confusion, deprive them of good education, and leave them incapable of proper understanding and judgment, making them easily incited and exploited. Although compared with the previous two centuries, workers’ material conditions have greatly improved, still “it is not poverty but inequality that is feared; not scarcity but insecurity that is resented.” The widening domestic gaps between rich and poor in various countries, and the imbalances of economic and political development internationally, all harm workers’ dignity and interests. With industrial transformation and the development of artificial intelligence, with the proliferation of “rust belt states,” the traditional industrial working class is more anxious and lost than in the materially scarce past, naturally prone to be drawn to extreme ideologies.

And the political and economic elites and mainstream intellectuals have not sufficiently recognized and cared about the plight and suffering of workers—indeed, compared with the past, their attention has clearly receded. Today’s leftist forces, especially elite leftists, lean more toward feminism, sexual minorities, environmentalism, and other more “fashionable” and “champagne” issues (of course, these issues are not truly “champagne-like” or superficial, but indeed very real and important issues—yet they have distracted attention away from workers’ rights issues). The neglect and even abandonment by the elite class have deepened workers’ discontent and sense of rejection, making them turn toward conservative forces to gain real benefits and seek psychological security and belonging—and this, too, is understandable.

But understanding is one thing—the populism, conservatism, and narrowness of the workers are, whether for their own long-term interests or for world peace and progress, gravely harmful.

In short, today’s world is full of countercurrents, with conflicts breaking out repeatedly, and different social identities splitting and opposing one another. Compared with decades ago, the world is not more unified, but more torn apart. The “Chinese model” of totalitarianism, Russian expansionism, Indian and Japanese conservative nationalist populism, and Western right-wing hegemonism together fill this world with ugliness, with the weak insulted and devoured, and humanity’s future shrouded in obscurity. The entirely unjust Russia-Ukraine war of the past year has further shown the world blood, corpses, ruined families—the fragility of civilization.

In such a chaotic and extreme era, there are not only no longer “prophets armed to the teeth” to sweep away evil and remake the human world, but not even “disarmed prophets” or “exiled prophets.” The once somewhat influential Peng Shuzhi and Wang Fanxi have long since passed away, and as for Trotskyists of Chen Duxiu’s kind—with outstanding character, abundant talent, and democratic convictions—they are nowhere to be found. The Fourth International, apart from being active in a few countries, has overall become a ceremonial, symbolic organization, lacking both the strength and the will to push the world toward continuous revolution and renewal.

What is the way forward for the future of Hong Kong, mainland China, and the entire world? Ten years ago there were still blueprints and hopes, but in recent years things have instead become increasingly muddled and unclear.


Yet, the light of hope still exists, and it exists precisely in you and other righteous men and women who are now suffering misfortune, in your like-minded younger comrades, and in the peoples all over the world who love freedom and democracy and pursue fairness and justice. The “White Paper Revolution” that broke out across China at the end of last year reflected that even under the high pressure of totalitarianism, many people, including young workers and students, still bravely fought against tyranny and raised the shocking voice of a new generation.

And according to various sources, many of the fighters in the “White Paper Revolution” were directly or indirectly influenced by the ideas of freedom, democracy, and justice that arose and spread from Hong Kong, which helped renew their values and inspired real action. Since the CCP took control of mainland China and carried out a series of crackdowns, massacres, and literary inquisitions, the mainland people generally lost their backbone, their spines broken, their morality corroded. It was Hong Kong—more precisely, Hong Kong’s patriotic democrats—that rejoined the broken bones of the Chinese people, restored the broken spine, and carried on the spirit of Chinese civilization.

And you are the hardest rib among Hong Kong’s people, together with Szeto Wah, Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho Chun-yan, and Koo Sze-yiu, supporting the unbending backbone of Hong Kong, carrying forward and amplifying the brave national spirit of self-strengthening. When in mainland China, from officials to commoners, all bowed slavishly to the strong and trampled the weak at will, mouths full of lies, betraying trust everywhere, silent for the public but noisy for themselves, immersed in material desires and petty strife, it was you and other Hong Kong righteous men who, selflessly public-minded, upright and courageous, spoke without fear, pleaded for the people, saying what mainlanders dared not say, doing what mainlanders dared not do, allowing the long-suffering and long-fallen Chinese nation still to retain in one corner of Victoria Harbour a conscience and courage, and enabling many victims to receive real help and warmth.

These things are remembered in the hearts of many mainland Chinese. Although many have been deceived, misled, and incited, not all mainlanders are brainwashed. Especially with regard to you—every mainlander who knows you, whatever their political stance, basically holds you in admiration. Toward other Hong Kong democrats, there are many misunderstandings and misreadings, but there are also those who are clear-sighted. What you have done for the mainland is worthwhile, and I here express my gratitude to you and all of Hong Kong’s patriotic democrats.

The post–Anti-Extradition crackdown and the “National Security Law” have sought to break the backbone that Hong Kong had carried on, to conquer the last soil of Han resistance. From the practical level, they have already succeeded. But human beings have not only bodies, but also spirit and soul. For the warriors, even when imprisoned or killed, their lofty aspirations do not change.

Although such words may seem like self-consolation, they are not merely self-consolation. In Chinese history and world history, violence and darkness have been frequent, and even longer-lasting than the light. In dark ages, people indeed find it hard to overcome barbaric and ruthless conquerors. But people can resist in various ways—including with the persistence of the spirit and the resistance of thought—accumulating strength and spreading civilization, awaiting the return of the light.

You have endured prison many times, and each time you have steadfastly survived, becoming even firmer and braver. This time will be no exception. Even though after release you will not have the same freedom as before, as long as life remains, anything is possible. Compared with the Jacobins perishing on the guillotine, the Paris Communards falling in cemeteries, the Trotskyists who perished in Russia’s civil war and Stalin’s purges, today still affords more possibilities for resistance and more room for maneuver.

Struggle and revolution are difficult; construction is even harder. More than two centuries of leftist revolutionary history, though it created many glories, also brought or worsened many disasters. From the ferocity of Soviet Russia to the ruthlessness of Red China, from the secret shadows of the Stasi east of the Berlin Wall to the brutality of the Kim dynasty north of the 38th Parallel, the “shining path” has been littered with vile atrocities. “Communism”—how many crimes have been committed in your name!

Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm exposed most clearly and plainly the truth of such regimes called communist but in reality “Big Brother” dictatorships. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” “Big Brother”/“Napoleon”—such predators always triumph in this negative selection, dominating hundreds of millions of subjects; while “Goldstein”/“Snowball,” no matter how brilliant their achievements, merely wove garments for “Big Brother,” and the military-political systems they built for the liberation and defense of the people became machines that harmed the people. Today the CCP’s big-data totalitarian system, with its wide reach and dense penetration, has far exceeded Orwell’s imagination. (But Orwell, even seeing and partly experiencing such things, still upheld socialist ideals, clearly declaring himself a democratic socialist, not the right-wing liberal that some Chinese liberals distort him into.)

If Marx and Trotsky could travel to the present, seeing the rise and fall and mutations of the red states, seeing commoners and the weak suffering more humiliation than under Tsarist Russia or the Republic of China, perhaps they would abandon many of their former claims and prefer instead Europe’s social democracy, the “revisionist” model? (Yet we cannot, because of the red disasters of the past, deny the greatness of the communist ideal and the value of permanent revolution. Peace and prosperity built on the humiliation and suffering of commoners, especially the underclass, are not worth keeping—better to rise and sacrifice, turning brocades into scorched earth.)

What should the future world be like? From the Confucius and Mozi of pre-Qin times, to Plato and Aristotle of Greece, from the East’s “investigation of things to acquire knowledge” to the West’s “encyclopedias,” from the radical violent revolution theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Trotsky, to the Social Democrats’ Gotha Program and the “Third Way/New Middle Path” that gradually rose in the 1990s—countless have pondered and summed up. And the vicissitudes of human history, the rise and fall of regimes one after another, all tell us, “Comrades, we must still strive.” What the forebears did was what they ought to have done; the road ahead still needs later generations to explore and think through.

You have experienced decades of turbulence and mortal struggle, and surely thought more deeply than I, a mere junior. I also hope you will reflect even more on the way forward for Hong Kong and the mainland, and the blueprint for the world.

Although, perhaps it is already too late? The crisis brought by global warming may make Hong Kong, in a few decades, highly uninhabitable, and in a century submerged. Mainland China and indeed most of the world will also be frequently harmed by the high heat, floods, and droughts of the climate crisis. This will be a challenge even harder to reverse and resist than politics.

Yet perhaps people will, before the climate crisis becomes utterly unmanageable, find ways to solve or mitigate it? Still, one should not be overly alarmist, but rather remain rational and calm, doing one’s best within the span of life, thinking and changing, rather than despairing and abandoning.

The retrogression of Xi’s regime in these years has made Chinese laborers “toil yet remain poor,” white-collar workers trapped in “996,” migrant workers bleeding and sweating daily, struggling a lifetime and still unable to finish paying off housing loans; Chinese peasants still impoverished, discriminated against, subjected to various violences; Chinese middle school students working from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. for six years, doing useless toil that consumes but produces nothing; Chinese women—girls and grown women alike—bullied, harassed, harmed, as commonplace as daily bread, never with full rights and dignity. Others such as the disabled, HIV and leprosy sufferers, prison inmates, are year-round discriminated against and abused, living worse than death… They are trapped in poverty, insecurity, and injury, unable to speak clearly or resist independently, and under constant humiliation from the state machine to street thugs, they have lost the most basic human dignity and even the slightest courage to resist.

At such a time, it is all the more necessary for some to speak for them, to express their indignation and demands, to help them summon courage, to restore dignity, to resist tyranny with them, to seek a way out, to promote change. “Permanent revolution” includes not only political revolution, but also economic revolution, and more importantly, social revolution. The people of mainland China are, outside of North Korea, the most deeply bound and oppressed in the world, and also the most in need of change and liberation. Their eyes gouged, ears sealed, mouths blocked, arms cut off, legs broken, brains washed—they need the just and peace-loving peoples of the world to see, hear, speak, and act for them, to assist them in seeing and hearing, to restore their speech, to reattach their limbs, to enlighten their thoughts, to awaken their consciences, so that they can gradually stand up again, become self-reliant, and turn into a force beneficial both to themselves and to others, to the public interest, and to world civilization.

You and many Hong Kong righteous men have spoken for the mainland people for decades, for which I am deeply grateful. And now the mainland people are still evidently unable to resist independently, still needing you and the younger ones you nurture to speak for the nation.

I also know that today in Hong Kong, aside from the establishment camp that are the CCP’s running dogs, most others are local populists, the traditional pan-democrats have waned, and the radical left is rarer than phoenix feathers. But this city, which once erupted in a series of revolutionary struggles, still has many deep and passionate fighters. The famous artist Anthony Wong Chau-sang has shown much interest in the Fourth International, and is also keen on critical realist literature and historiography. He has trained many younger ones—surely some will be willing to inherit his mantle and ideas?

I think you are the same. Although today most Hong Kongers with rebellious spirit are similar in stance to Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Yau Wai-ching, Tiffany Yuen Ka-wai, in their localist self-determination and Hong Kong city-state views, and scornful of leftism and Greater China-ism, surely not all are like that? Chow Hang-tung, Ms. Ho Kit-wan are representatives of newcomers who are progressive and concerned with mainland human rights. But they are indeed too few and marginalized.

I hope that after you are released, you can give more teachings to Hong Kong youths devoted to justice, telling them of the century-long or even centuries-long suffering of the mainland Chinese, their present plight and despair. I also hope you will tell them where Hong Kong people’s bloodline, culture, and values truly lie. Hong Kong youth may despise and distance themselves from mainlanders due to their low quality, distorted values, and ugly society. But isn’t the current situation of the mainland and its people one of “longing for clouds in a drought, longing for generals in national calamity,” crying out for rescue by an “international brigade”?

1.4 billion souls suffer in pain, numbness, and decay. There must be a modern Prometheus to bring hope to their hearts, to clear the homeland dark even in daylight. Whether in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or countries around the world, whoever can bring democracy, progress, and justice to China—all conscientious Chinese will be deeply grateful.

Of course, the realization of freedom and democracy in mainland China fundamentally requires the mainland people themselves to rise up. External support can only play a role if mainland people respond and cooperate, not if they treat it as “hostile foreign forces” and hate it. As for mainlanders’ attitude toward Hong Kong democrats, the changes in Hong Kong-mainland relations in past years have indeed given disappointing and even despairing answers. But it should not be so forever. For example, many mainlanders, after enduring the tortures of lockdowns and quarantines during three years of “Zero-Covid,” changed their view of the Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Movement from hostility to understanding, respect, and even support. And now, as Xi continues retrogression and popular resentment boils over, perhaps mainlanders will more and more understand Hong Kongers’ values, ideals, courage, and persistence, merging again and resisting tyranny together.

If, after all these sufferings, mainland Chinese still cannot awaken in years to come, still hating Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy forces, then such people neither deserve to be saved, nor can be saved.

In any case, I still hope you will not regret your original intention, but persist in your ideals and spirit of struggle, and pass them on to more people. I have been inspired and encouraged by you (and of course also by other role models such as Yue Fei, Lin Zhao, and Xu Zhiyong), and have persisted to this day. Of course, the persistence of a mere nobody like me adds little to the grand situation. But if tens of thousands of such nobodies are united as one, then the flag of freedom will surely rise again to the skies, the bell of liberty will once more ring. Without resistance, how can there be change? To support the weak and lift up the fallen, with no thought of turning back—this is not only the motto of the League of Social Democrats, but should also be the common creed of every son and daughter of China.

There are still many things to write and say, and I cannot finish them all. What I have written and felt above is already quite fragmentary. Perhaps there will be other opportunities to make contact in the future. I hope you will be released soon, and also wish you and your partner Ms. Chan peace and health.

(On the history of leftist revolutions, national history, injustice and the suffering of vulnerable groups, the historical connections between the mainland and Hong Kong, the distortion and misuse of socialism/communism, populism, June Fourth, the pursuit of democracy, the transformations of Chinese liberals, the future of the mainland and Hong Kong, and personal reflections and expectations)


Respected Mr. Leung Kwok-hung:

I am Wang Qingmin, a writer living in Europe. During my middle school years, I already heard your name and learned about your deeds through media, newspapers, and the internet. Whether it was your struggle for the rights of the hardworking laborers and the suffering underclass, your more than thirty years of persistence in calling for the vindication of June Fourth and accountability for Beijing’s massacre, your outcry for justice for the Chinese people killed by Japanese invaders in the Nanjing Massacre, your fundraising for disaster relief for the people of Sichuan during the Wenchuan Earthquake, or your support for many political prisoners and resisters in mainland China, your sense of justice, courage, and action have always earned my deepest admiration. I have long wished to meet you, but unfortunately have never had the opportunity.

Five years ago, when I went to Hong Kong for some personal matters and political appeals, I once went to the League of Social Democrats in hopes of visiting you, but I did not find you there. A few days later, when I went to the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government to “scout the site” in preparation for a protest, I happened to see you and other comrades of the League of Social Democrats engaged in protest. But at that time many journalists and police surrounded you, and you left quickly. I also worried about disrupting your protest and the media’s interviews, so I could not speak with you, and in the end only watched you leave.

Later, after experiencing various things and traveling through many places, I left mainland China and came to Europe. Before I had even fully settled down, I heard about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Movement that had erupted in Hong Kong. In just over a year, Hong Kong’s political opposition was wiped out, and civil society was completely destroyed. And you, too, were imprisoned. This was something I had never expected.

In these years, whether in the unexpected twists and changes of my own life, or in the shifting circumstances I have seen and heard in mainland China, Hong Kong, and the world, I have come to understand fully the impermanence of life and of worldly affairs.

Yet in this ever-changing world, what is needed even more is sincere perseverance. And you are exactly such an exemplar, one who for decades has upheld ideals, abided by conscience, and defended justice. I have read about your life and many of your deeds, and I know that from the British colonial era you were already committed to the socialist movement, loving your country and your people, and serving as a vanguard of Hong Kong’s leftist revolution. The “Revolutionary Marxist League” in which you participated was one of the very few Hong Kong political organizations of that era that clearly opposed colonialism, capitalism, and conservatism.

After the 1967 Uprising (the 1967 Riots—which, in fact, we should more properly call an uprising; although the uprising was exploited and harmed some innocent people—this indeed requires apology and repentance—it was still, on the whole, a revolutionary struggle against colonialism and corruption, in pursuit of justice) was suppressed, Hong Kong’s leftist movement fell into long dormancy. Yet you, unafraid of the high-pressure authoritarianism of the British colonial authorities and of the Chinese Communist regime that colluded with them, still held fast to your ideals, even moving against the tide—speaking up and fighting for laborers, women, and the underclass, nearly single-handedly carving out in Hong Kong a new path of “continuing revolution” that was both radical and yet peaceful and sustainable. Whether denouncing the dictatorship of the CCP, or criticizing the Hong Kong establishment (especially the Liberal Party and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong) for disregarding the rights and interests of the common people, you always spoke with reason and power, forcing them to make some concessions, giving up part of their vested interests in order to placate laborers and the underclass.

It is precisely because of your presence that Hong Kong’s workers and underclass people have had support and hope, allowing this city—steeped in the stench of brutal capitalism and marked by vast disparities between rich and poor—to still let shine, through its cracks, the rays of social justice and the light of equality and fraternity.

Even more worthy of admiration is that you are not one of those reverse nationalists who abandon the nation and the people for leftist revolution and internationalism. On the contrary, your ardent and sincere patriotism far surpasses that of the overwhelming majority of mainland and Hong Kong politicians and intellectuals. Whether in the Diaoyu Islands protection movement, in denouncing the Nanjing Massacre, in pursuing accountability for Japan’s war crimes and forced labor, in criticizing the crimes of Western imperial powers, or in exposing the evil deeds of the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong and their discrimination and oppression of Hong Kong people, you have always been passionate and sincere, never wavering over decades. Your sense of justice, your courage, and your national spirit make me, like a small blade of grass in the mountains, look up to the sunrise in the east, receiving lessons for the soul and strength in justice.

The Sino-British negotiations and Hong Kong’s return were supposed to be another stage victory of the national democratic revolution. But the motherland to which Hong Kong returned was not truly a national democratic state, but rather one that was authoritarian and dictatorial, marked by brutal capitalism, collusion with conservative and reactionary forces of various countries. This was not only the case in Deng Xiaoping’s era—it had already been so in Mao Zedong’s era. Whether it was Mao’s “thanks to Japan’s invasion,” his meeting with Nixon, or his kindness to Pinochet and other Latin American right-wing military dictators burdened with blood debts, the CCP had long since betrayed the nation and the people, and abandoned the ideals of revolution. Deng Xiaoping’s era not only continued this, but went further in launching the Tiananmen Massacre, crushing the Chinese nation’s century-long democratic dream.

After Hong Kong’s return, apart from hypocritically awarding a few small honors to certain people from the 1967 Uprising as consolation, the CCP completely tilted toward the powerful and the capitalists. The CCP and the Hong Kong government were in fact even more pro-power and pro-business than the British colonial government. The living conditions of laborers and the underclass did not see systemic improvement; Hong Kong remained a paradise of neoliberalism and a filthy marketplace for deals among global elites. While Hong Kong laborers and maids curled up in “coffin homes,” the likes of Jasper Tsang feasted and toasted in “Banquet House.” And the straight-line distance between the two may not have been more than 500 meters.

In dealing with Japan’s invasion and the crimes of Western colonialism, the CCP on the one hand exploited these to rally and buy off the hearts of the people, resisting the infiltration of the West and universal values, but on the other hand suppressed genuine reflection, criticism, and accountability regarding Japan’s crimes and imperialist colonialism—using false nationalism to stifle true nationalism, constructing the “Chinese Nation” as a replacement to blur and dilute the real and powerful cohesion, unity, and emotion of the Han nation, in order to control the Han people and, along with them, all the other peoples of the country. In foreign relations, whether toward Japan, Britain, the U.S., or the imperialist powers, the CCP has always belittled them in words but courted them in reality, seeking their favor and exchanging it for their support of CCP rule in China, willingly acting as the “territorial guard” for foreign powers. Meanwhile, the people of Hong Kong and mainland China, especially the mainlanders, have suffered the dual exploitation of the CCP elites and foreign colonizers, directly and indirectly. Whether the “Friendship Stores” of the Mao era or the “sweatshops” of the Deng era, both reflected that the nature of the “semi-colonial and semi-feudal society” had not changed.

In 2018, the Jasic workers’ struggle in Shenzhen was one of the very few large-scale collective resistances in China since June Fourth, and also the peak of China’s labor movement, demonstrating the courage of the Chinese working class and the solidarity of workers and students. But the Jasic workers’ movement was ultimately brutally suppressed by the CCP regime, with many workers and young students arrested, and dissemination both offline and online prohibited. This once again exposed the reactionary essence of the CCP regime as one belonging to a privileged bourgeoisie.

In the Huawei Meng Wanzhou incident, the CCP did not hesitate to take foreigners hostage, destroying Sino-Canadian/Sino-American relations to save this “princeling,” yet turned a blind eye to the arrests of Hong Kong youths Kwok Siu-kit and Yim Man-wah, who protested at Japan’s Yasukuni Shrine. This once again proved in fact that the CCP regime is one that only defends the interests of its privileged class, disregarding national interests and the rights of ordinary citizens—an “internal colonial” regime. (And at the time of the Meng Wanzhou incident, when a Huawei executive was arrested in Poland, both Huawei and the Chinese government quickly “cut ties” with him, which likewise reflected this discriminatory double standard of the CCP.)

Such a “motherland”—is it still possible to love? Although the regime and the people are two different things, one has to admit that at least among China’s vested-interest class, those with discourse power, and highly educated middle-aged and young men in China, whether supporters of the CCP establishment or anti-CCP opposition, whether nominally leftist or rightist, most are in fact either social Darwinists, reverse nationalists, or false nationalists—or even a combination of these (including some of those whom you once supported and helped, and for whom you once raised your voice in front of the Liaison Office). They are no different from, or are simply the mirror image of, what the CCP openly advocates or tacitly encourages. With such a state and such citizens, it is truly difficult to “love.”

And Hong Kong, in recent years, has also become increasingly “mainlandized.” The Hong Kong establishment is highly bound together with the CCP’s privileged class, and the suppression and erosion of Hong Kong people’s freedoms grows heavier by the day. Compared with the British colonial government, which at least spoke somewhat of modern capitalist humanitarianism (though in essence hypocritical, limited, and aimed at maintaining bourgeois and colonial rule), the CCP practices survival-of-the-fittest social Darwinism, using “patriotism” as a fig leaf while lacking genuine patriotism, with hypocrisy and shamelessness surpassing even that of the British colonial authorities. As for the promised pursuit of building a “new democratic society” and a “communist society,” those ideals were long since thrown to the winds.

Yet in such a country and city, under such an ideology and reality, you have nevertheless remained unchanged for decades, holding to the revolutionary beginning and ideals, unceasingly fighting for social justice. In the Legislative Council, before the Liaison Office, in Central, in Victoria Park, you have time and again fiercely denounced the ugly deeds of those arrogant scoundrels, with unrestrained power; you have spoken for laborers and women, supported political prisoners and rights defenders in the mainland, with sincerity and strength; for decades you have tirelessly rushed about, navigating among various powerful forces and complex gray networks of interests, striving to win discourse power and legitimate benefits for those who cannot speak or resist, step by step, grounded and practical.

You have also endured prison many times for your resistance. When I was detained in a police station and placed in a mental hospital in Hong Kong due to protest activities and self-harm, I could hardly endure even just a few hours in the sweltering environment of the Western District Police Station detention cell. It was difficult even to softly hum the “Internationale.” With that experience, I can even more profoundly understand and admire your resilience, bravery, and greatness.

For your words, deeds, and spiritual qualities, there are no words left to describe in further praise—everything has already been said, and no more can be added.

After the Anti-Extradition Movement and the crackdown of 2019–2020, the CCP regime completely tore up the contract of “Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong, with a high degree of autonomy,” abandoned the promise of “fifty years unchanged,” and took the opportunity to completely crush the political opposition and indeed all of Hong Kong’s civil society. Not only was violent resistance suppressed, but even resistance through peaceful means such as parliament and demonstrations was no longer permitted. This reveals the utter madness of Xi’s CCP, and also reflects the cruel, dark, and suffocating reality of today’s Hong Kong and all of China.

And it is not only China—the entire global situation makes one feel uneasy, even pessimistic and pained. The progressive waves that once swept the world—whether Roosevelt’s New Deal, the movements of 1968, the Carnation Revolution and the third wave of democratization, the rise of the Latin American left, the Arab Spring… all have passed and receded (though with some partial returns, such as Lula defeating Bolsonaro in Brazil). Today’s world is one of rampant right-wing conservative populism—from America’s reactionary forces of Trump-Pence-Pompeo-DeSantis, to India’s Modi, Hungary’s Orbán, Russia’s Putin, and even Japan’s Shinzo Abe and Fumio Kishida—regimes are undermining world peace and progress, and oppressed, vulnerable nations and peoples suffer even more.

In Hong Kong too, there emerged a strong localist populist force, which split the pan-democratic camp, intensified conflicts between the mainland and Hong Kong, and together with Xi’s regime broke the tacit understandings between the CCP and Hong Kong’s non-establishment, leading to a series of violent conflicts during the Anti-Extradition Movement. Of course, they should not be overly blamed—the CCP was the greatest culprit. But Hong Kong’s localists and the “brave fighters,” though their actions can be understood and sympathized with, were ultimately narrow and shortsighted, unlikely to achieve Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy, and deviating from universal justice. I respect them, but I also hope even more that they will in the end stand on the same front as Hong Kong’s pan-democrats and the oppressed people of mainland China.

Even more tragic is that the laboring class—which once represented the vanguard of advanced productive forces and new civilization—has undergone a split, with part of it becoming instead an important component of right-wing conservative populist forces. On the one hand, they strive for their own rights and benefits, but on the other hand they oppose women’s rights, LGBT rights, the rights of minorities and other vulnerable groups, even opposing workers in other countries gaining benefits, and engaging in competition and harm among workers themselves, while believing in various conspiracy theories and hate-inciting propaganda, becoming narrow, anti-intellectual, and blindly obedient. Although not all laborers are like this, at least a considerable portion of workers (whether in the West or in the Third World) have indeed degenerated.

In fact, the working class has always had a dual or even multiple nature. On the one hand, workers are the core of productive forces, the backbone of production relations, the main force of human industrialization, modernization, and civilization. Without workers, there would be no prosperous and great world today. On the other hand, the working class also has selfishness, ignorance, and narrowness. In China, the “worker aristocrats” of state-owned enterprises in the Mao era had already degenerated into an exploiting class and rent-seekers, whose value creation fell far short of their income, and who became a conservative and stubborn force obstructing reform. As for the lower and middle workers, their labor and contributions deserve respect, sympathy, and support, but at least a considerable portion of them are misogynistic, hostile to the weak (even though they themselves are weak), exclusionary of the different, cruel and violent, anti-intellectual and superstitious. Even though these problems are fundamentally the result of oppression, brainwashing, and manipulation by the ruling class, they must still bear part of the blame themselves.

Even in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the working class had these problems, but compared with feudal conservative forces and the primitive barbaric bourgeoisie, the conservatism and narrowness of workers were not so prominent. At that time, they even converged with progressive currents such as feminism, and throughout most of the 20th century they were part of the progressive forces, standing together with feminists, the disabled, minorities, and others. But after a century, with the development of the times and the reshuffling of forces, at least part of the laborers have instead regressed to a level of reaction comparable to the workers of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan under the Emperor and the military. When Brazilian truck drivers abandoned the Workers’ Party and instead fervently supported the far-right fascist Bolsonaro, calling for the return of military dictatorship, this most clearly revealed such a tragic degeneration.

Yet this degeneration is not entirely incomprehensible. Various forms of exploitation, oppression, deception, and violence place workers in pain and confusion, deprive them of good education, and leave them incapable of proper understanding and judgment, making them easily incited and exploited. Although compared with the previous two centuries, workers’ material conditions have greatly improved, still “it is not poverty but inequality that is feared; not scarcity but insecurity that is resented.” The widening domestic gaps between rich and poor in various countries, and the imbalances of economic and political development internationally, all harm workers’ dignity and interests. With industrial transformation and the development of artificial intelligence, with the proliferation of “rust belt states,” the traditional industrial working class is more anxious and lost than in the materially scarce past, naturally prone to be drawn to extreme ideologies.

And the political and economic elites and mainstream intellectuals have not sufficiently recognized and cared about the plight and suffering of workers—indeed, compared with the past, their attention has clearly receded. Today’s leftist forces, especially elite leftists, lean more toward feminism, sexual minorities, environmentalism, and other more “fashionable” and “champagne” issues (of course, these issues are not truly “champagne-like” or superficial, but indeed very real and important issues—yet they have distracted attention away from workers’ rights issues). The neglect and even abandonment by the elite class have deepened workers’ discontent and sense of rejection, making them turn toward conservative forces to gain real benefits and seek psychological security and belonging—and this, too, is understandable.

But understanding is one thing—the populism, conservatism, and narrowness of the workers are, whether for their own long-term interests or for world peace and progress, gravely harmful.

In short, today’s world is full of countercurrents, with conflicts breaking out repeatedly, and different social identities splitting and opposing one another. Compared with decades ago, the world is not more unified, but more torn apart. The “Chinese model” of totalitarianism, Russian expansionism, Indian and Japanese conservative nationalist populism, and Western right-wing hegemonism together fill this world with ugliness, with the weak insulted and devoured, and humanity’s future shrouded in obscurity. The entirely unjust Russia-Ukraine war of the past year has further shown the world blood, corpses, ruined families—the fragility of civilization.

In such a chaotic and extreme era, there are not only no longer “prophets armed to the teeth” to sweep away evil and remake the human world, but not even “disarmed prophets” or “exiled prophets.” The once somewhat influential Peng Shuzhi and Wang Fanxi have long since passed away, and as for Trotskyists of Chen Duxiu’s kind—with outstanding character, abundant talent, and democratic convictions—they are nowhere to be found. The Fourth International, apart from being active in a few countries, has overall become a ceremonial, symbolic organization, lacking both the strength and the will to push the world toward continuous revolution and renewal.

What is the way forward for the future of Hong Kong, mainland China, and the entire world? Ten years ago there were still blueprints and hopes, but in recent years things have instead become increasingly muddled and unclear.


Yet, the light of hope still exists, and it exists precisely in you and other righteous men and women who are now suffering misfortune, in your like-minded younger comrades, and in the peoples all over the world who love freedom and democracy and pursue fairness and justice. The “White Paper Revolution” that broke out across China at the end of last year reflected that even under the high pressure of totalitarianism, many people, including young workers and students, still bravely fought against tyranny and raised the shocking voice of a new generation.

And according to various sources, many of the fighters in the “White Paper Revolution” were directly or indirectly influenced by the ideas of freedom, democracy, and justice that arose and spread from Hong Kong, which helped renew their values and inspired real action. Since the CCP took control of mainland China and carried out a series of crackdowns, massacres, and literary inquisitions, the mainland people generally lost their backbone, their spines broken, their morality corroded. It was Hong Kong—more precisely, Hong Kong’s patriotic democrats—that rejoined the broken bones of the Chinese people, restored the broken spine, and carried on the spirit of Chinese civilization.

And you are the hardest rib among Hong Kong’s people, together with Szeto Wah, Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho Chun-yan, and Koo Sze-yiu, supporting the unbending backbone of Hong Kong, carrying forward and amplifying the brave national spirit of self-strengthening. When in mainland China, from officials to commoners, all bowed slavishly to the strong and trampled the weak at will, mouths full of lies, betraying trust everywhere, silent for the public but noisy for themselves, immersed in material desires and petty strife, it was you and other Hong Kong righteous men who, selflessly public-minded, upright and courageous, spoke without fear, pleaded for the people, saying what mainlanders dared not say, doing what mainlanders dared not do, allowing the long-suffering and long-fallen Chinese nation still to retain in one corner of Victoria Harbour a conscience and courage, and enabling many victims to receive real help and warmth.

These things are remembered in the hearts of many mainland Chinese. Although many have been deceived, misled, and incited, not all mainlanders are brainwashed. Especially with regard to you—every mainlander who knows you, whatever their political stance, basically holds you in admiration. Toward other Hong Kong democrats, there are many misunderstandings and misreadings, but there are also those who are clear-sighted. What you have done for the mainland is worthwhile, and I here express my gratitude to you and all of Hong Kong’s patriotic democrats.

The post–Anti-Extradition crackdown and the “National Security Law” have sought to break the backbone that Hong Kong had carried on, to conquer the last soil of Han resistance. From the practical level, they have already succeeded. But human beings have not only bodies, but also spirit and soul. For the warriors, even when imprisoned or killed, their lofty aspirations do not change.

Although such words may seem like self-consolation, they are not merely self-consolation. In Chinese history and world history, violence and darkness have been frequent, and even longer-lasting than the light. In dark ages, people indeed find it hard to overcome barbaric and ruthless conquerors. But people can resist in various ways—including with the persistence of the spirit and the resistance of thought—accumulating strength and spreading civilization, awaiting the return of the light.

You have endured prison many times, and each time you have steadfastly survived, becoming even firmer and braver. This time will be no exception. Even though after release you will not have the same freedom as before, as long as life remains, anything is possible. Compared with the Jacobins perishing on the guillotine, the Paris Communards falling in cemeteries, the Trotskyists who perished in Russia’s civil war and Stalin’s purges, today still affords more possibilities for resistance and more room for maneuver.

Struggle and revolution are difficult; construction is even harder. More than two centuries of leftist revolutionary history, though it created many glories, also brought or worsened many disasters. From the ferocity of Soviet Russia to the ruthlessness of Red China, from the secret shadows of the Stasi east of the Berlin Wall to the brutality of the Kim dynasty north of the 38th Parallel, the “shining path” has been littered with vile atrocities. “Communism”—how many crimes have been committed in your name!

Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm exposed most clearly and plainly the truth of such regimes called communist but in reality “Big Brother” dictatorships. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” “Big Brother”/“Napoleon”—such predators always triumph in this negative selection, dominating hundreds of millions of subjects; while “Goldstein”/“Snowball,” no matter how brilliant their achievements, merely wove garments for “Big Brother,” and the military-political systems they built for the liberation and defense of the people became machines that harmed the people. Today the CCP’s big-data totalitarian system, with its wide reach and dense penetration, has far exceeded Orwell’s imagination. (But Orwell, even seeing and partly experiencing such things, still upheld socialist ideals, clearly declaring himself a democratic socialist, not the right-wing liberal that some Chinese liberals distort him into.)

If Marx and Trotsky could travel to the present, seeing the rise and fall and mutations of the red states, seeing commoners and the weak suffering more humiliation than under Tsarist Russia or the Republic of China, perhaps they would abandon many of their former claims and prefer instead Europe’s social democracy, the “revisionist” model? (Yet we cannot, because of the red disasters of the past, deny the greatness of the communist ideal and the value of permanent revolution. Peace and prosperity built on the humiliation and suffering of commoners, especially the underclass, are not worth keeping—better to rise and sacrifice, turning brocades into scorched earth.)

What should the future world be like? From the Confucius and Mozi of pre-Qin times, to Plato and Aristotle of Greece, from the East’s “investigation of things to acquire knowledge” to the West’s “encyclopedias,” from the radical violent revolution theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Trotsky, to the Social Democrats’ Gotha Program and the “Third Way/New Middle Path” that gradually rose in the 1990s—countless have pondered and summed up. And the vicissitudes of human history, the rise and fall of regimes one after another, all tell us, “Comrades, we must still strive.” What the forebears did was what they ought to have done; the road ahead still needs later generations to explore and think through.

You have experienced decades of turbulence and mortal struggle, and surely thought more deeply than I, a mere junior. I also hope you will reflect even more on the way forward for Hong Kong and the mainland, and the blueprint for the world.

Although, perhaps it is already too late? The crisis brought by global warming may make Hong Kong, in a few decades, highly uninhabitable, and in a century submerged. Mainland China and indeed most of the world will also be frequently harmed by the high heat, floods, and droughts of the climate crisis. This will be a challenge even harder to reverse and resist than politics.

Yet perhaps people will, before the climate crisis becomes utterly unmanageable, find ways to solve or mitigate it? Still, one should not be overly alarmist, but rather remain rational and calm, doing one’s best within the span of life, thinking and changing, rather than despairing and abandoning.

The retrogression of Xi’s regime in these years has made Chinese laborers “toil yet remain poor,” white-collar workers trapped in “996,” migrant workers bleeding and sweating daily, struggling a lifetime and still unable to finish paying off housing loans; Chinese peasants still impoverished, discriminated against, subjected to various violences; Chinese middle school students working from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. for six years, doing useless toil that consumes but produces nothing; Chinese women—girls and grown women alike—bullied, harassed, harmed, as commonplace as daily bread, never with full rights and dignity. Others such as the disabled, HIV and leprosy sufferers, prison inmates, are year-round discriminated against and abused, living worse than death… They are trapped in poverty, insecurity, and injury, unable to speak clearly or resist independently, and under constant humiliation from the state machine to street thugs, they have lost the most basic human dignity and even the slightest courage to resist.

At such a time, it is all the more necessary for some to speak for them, to express their indignation and demands, to help them summon courage, to restore dignity, to resist tyranny with them, to seek a way out, to promote change. “Permanent revolution” includes not only political revolution, but also economic revolution, and more importantly, social revolution. The people of mainland China are, outside of North Korea, the most deeply bound and oppressed in the world, and also the most in need of change and liberation. Their eyes gouged, ears sealed, mouths blocked, arms cut off, legs broken, brains washed—they need the just and peace-loving peoples of the world to see, hear, speak, and act for them, to assist them in seeing and hearing, to restore their speech, to reattach their limbs, to enlighten their thoughts, to awaken their consciences, so that they can gradually stand up again, become self-reliant, and turn into a force beneficial both to themselves and to others, to the public interest, and to world civilization.

You and many Hong Kong righteous men have spoken for the mainland people for decades, for which I am deeply grateful. And now the mainland people are still evidently unable to resist independently, still needing you and the younger ones you nurture to speak for the nation.

I also know that today in Hong Kong, aside from the establishment camp that are the CCP’s running dogs, most others are local populists, the traditional pan-democrats have waned, and the radical left is rarer than phoenix feathers. But this city, which once erupted in a series of revolutionary struggles, still has many deep and passionate fighters. The famous artist Anthony Wong Chau-sang has shown much interest in the Fourth International, and is also keen on critical realist literature and historiography. He has trained many younger ones—surely some will be willing to inherit his mantle and ideas?

I think you are the same. Although today most Hong Kongers with rebellious spirit are similar in stance to Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Yau Wai-ching, Tiffany Yuen Ka-wai, in their localist self-determination and Hong Kong city-state views, and scornful of leftism and Greater China-ism, surely not all are like that? Chow Hang-tung, Ms. Ho Kit-wan are representatives of newcomers who are progressive and concerned with mainland human rights. But they are indeed too few and marginalized.

I hope that after you are released, you can give more teachings to Hong Kong youths devoted to justice, telling them of the century-long or even centuries-long suffering of the mainland Chinese, their present plight and despair. I also hope you will tell them where Hong Kong people’s bloodline, culture, and values truly lie. Hong Kong youth may despise and distance themselves from mainlanders due to their low quality, distorted values, and ugly society. But isn’t the current situation of the mainland and its people one of “longing for clouds in a drought, longing for generals in national calamity,” crying out for rescue by an “international brigade”?

1.4 billion souls suffer in pain, numbness, and decay. There must be a modern Prometheus to bring hope to their hearts, to clear the homeland dark even in daylight. Whether in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or countries around the world, whoever can bring democracy, progress, and justice to China—all conscientious Chinese will be deeply grateful.

Of course, the realization of freedom and democracy in mainland China fundamentally requires the mainland people themselves to rise up. External support can only play a role if mainland people respond and cooperate, not if they treat it as “hostile foreign forces” and hate it. As for mainlanders’ attitude toward Hong Kong democrats, the changes in Hong Kong-mainland relations in past years have indeed given disappointing and even despairing answers. But it should not be so forever. For example, many mainlanders, after enduring the tortures of lockdowns and quarantines during three years of “Zero-Covid,” changed their view of the Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Movement from hostility to understanding, respect, and even support. And now, as Xi continues retrogression and popular resentment boils over, perhaps mainlanders will more and more understand Hong Kongers’ values, ideals, courage, and persistence, merging again and resisting tyranny together.

If, after all these sufferings, mainland Chinese still cannot awaken in years to come, still hating Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy forces, then such people neither deserve to be saved, nor can be saved.

In any case, I still hope you will not regret your original intention, but persist in your ideals and spirit of struggle, and pass them on to more people. I have been inspired and encouraged by you (and of course also by other role models such as Yue Fei, Lin Zhao, and Xu Zhiyong), and have persisted to this day. Of course, the persistence of a mere nobody like me adds little to the grand situation. But if tens of thousands of such nobodies are united as one, then the flag of freedom will surely rise again to the skies, the bell of liberty will once more ring. Without resistance, how can there be change? To support the weak and lift up the fallen, with no thought of turning back—this is not only the motto of the League of Social Democrats, but should also be the common creed of every son and daughter of China.

There are still many things to write and say, and I cannot finish them all. What I have written and felt above is already quite fragmentary. Perhaps there will be other opportunities to make contact in the future. I hope you will be released soon, and also wish you and your partner Ms. Chan peace and health.
