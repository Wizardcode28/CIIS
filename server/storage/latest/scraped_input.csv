Gay people's future in india,1qbryt2,2,1,2026-01-13 13:57:02,Raj_Dutta3731,LGBTindia,I so regret not taking science or commerce stream in 11th grade. These two streams helps to go to foreign countries and get jobs there. I have nightmares about Bangladeshi 'Miya's taking over India and destroying whatever rights gay people have in India. In Assam they openly threatening local Assamese population. I don't feel safe until Bangladeshi immigrants problem is solved. But because of vote bank politics political parties only care about appeasement.. 💔,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTindia/comments/1qbryt2/gay_peoples_future_in_india/

Trump's Tariff War 2.0: It's Not Just China Anymore

Remember Trump's first trade war? This one, 2.0, is on a whole other level. Instead of just targeting China, it's an ""all-out brawl"" with pretty much everyone. Trump calls it a ""universal tariff.""

On April 5th, a 10% baseline tariff hit almost all imports. Then came the so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"":

• China: 34%

• EU: 20%

• Japan: 24%

• India: 26%

• Vietnam: 46%

Trump dubbed the day he signed the order ""Liberation Day."" The markets, however, felt anything but liberated. They freaked out. Stocks and even U.S. bonds plummeted, which really got the government's attention. The bond market is the one thing you don't mess with. This forced them to pause the new tariffs for 90 days, telling everyone, ""Let's talk.""

So, what was the point of all this? Officially, it was about reversing the trade deficit and boosting government revenue. But honestly, that's mostly for show. The real goals were bringing manufacturing back to the US, protecting key industries for national security, and, most importantly, creating leverage for negotiations. This whole thing is less about economics and more about political and industrial strategy.

How Did the World Respond?  
Everyone scrambled to make a deal.

  
• China: Fought back hard at first, with tariff threats going over 100%. But by October, they reached a temporary truce. The US paused the extra 24% tariff, and China agreed to buy more American soybeans and crack down on fentanyl.

• The EU: They were not happy. But they were also divided. Germany was terrified of the 25% auto tariff, while France was more worried about agriculture. In the end, they settled for a 15% base tariff (including on cars) but had to promise to buy $750 billion in US energy and invest another $600 billion.

• Japan & South Korea: They went with the ""invest to de-escalate"" strategy. Japan pledged $550 billion in US investments, and South Korea promised $350 billion. In return, their tariffs (including for cars) were lowered to 15%.

• The UK & Australia: As the ""good buddies,"" they got a better deal at 10%.

• India: They played hardball. Their tariff only dropped from 26% to 25%. But then Trump slapped them with an extra 25% penalty for buying Russian oil, bringing their total to 50%. They're still in talks.

So, the new tariff landscape looks something like this:

• Best Buds (like the UK): 10%

• ""Friends"" who made concessions (EU, Japan, SK): 15-20%

• Targets (like China) or tough negotiators (like India): 25% and up.

The US Economy: Just ""OK""  
With all this chaos, you'd think the US economy would be in shambles. But it's... just okay. Not great, not terrible. For 2025, the numbers are pretty boring: 2.0% GDP growth, 2.7% inflation, 4.2% unemployment. But ""boring"" is actually a huge win given the circumstances.

However, there are some serious issues under the surface:

1. A Weaker Dollar: The dollar had its worst start to a year in half a century. Trust in the US is shaky.  
2. Massive Government Debt: The US government is spending way more than it earns, with the national debt now over $38 trillion (125% of GDP). They even had the longest government shutdown in history (43 days).  
3. The AI boom is a double-edged sword: U.S. tech giants are pouring crazy amounts of money into AI, with four companies spending more than $300 billion in capital expenditures (CapEx) in 2025 alone. This is driving heavy investment. But here's the thing: It doesn't create jobs. In fact, employment in AI-related industries is declining. This is a capital boom, not a jobs boom.

A New, Fractured World  
All of this is reshaping the global economy. The old motto was, ""Make it wherever it's cheapest."" The new motto is, ""Make it wherever it's safest.""

We're moving away from a system based on rules (like the WTO, which is basically braindead at this point) to one based on deals and politics. This is creating a fractured world:

• Countries are splitting from each other.

• Consumers are disconnected from producers.

• Industries are siloed.

• The gap between the rich and the poor is widening.

It's a whole new ballgame, and we're all just trying to figure out the new rules.

What are your thoughts on this? Are we heading for more instability, or will this new order eventually find its balance? Let's discuss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1qbrw18/learn_about_the_global_economy_over_the_past_year/
Pakistan Is Run by a Discount Military. India Is Being Run by Discount Corporations,1qbr8tl,15,5,2026-01-13 13:26:07,Quiet_Form_2800,india,"

Pakistan is often described as a country with an army and a flag. The military runs the economy, media, courts, and foreign policy. Civilian governments are decorative. Everyone understands this, including Pakistanis.
By “discount military”, I mean a military that exercises maximum political and economic control while delivering minimum professional outcomes. 
India is drifting toward a parallel model, just with better branding.

Replace generals with boardrooms. Replace khaki with pinstripes. Replace martial law with electoral legitimacy. The outcome is structurally similar.

Pakistan’s problem is military supremacy. India’s emerging problem is corporate supremacy under ideological cover.

Under the Bharatiya Janata Party and its parent ecosystem Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, power is being centralized not in institutions but around a small cluster of favoured conglomerates, most visibly Reliance Industries and Adani Group.

Pakistan hands over cement, sugar, real estate, and logistics to military fronts.
India hands over ports, airports, telecom, energy, data, and retail to politically insulated corporations.

In Pakistan, the army justifies control in the name of national security.
In India, corporations are justified in the name of nationalism and development.

Different excuses. Same concentration.

Pakistan’s generals crush dissent directly.
India’s corporate state suppresses it indirectly through media ownership, advertising pressure, regulatory silence, and selective enforcement.

Pakistan’s economy is hostage to army businesses.
India’s trade, transport, and communication infrastructure is increasingly hostage to the financial health and legal exposure of a few conglomerates.

This is why comparisons make people uncomfortable. Indians like to think the problem is uniquely Pakistani. It is not. The form has changed, not the function.

Pakistan shows what happens when guns dominate the state.
India risks showing what happens when balance sheets dominate the state.

Neither model is a republic in substance.

One is run by a cheap military.
The other is being run by cheap capitalism wearing a saffron filter.

If Pakistan is a cautionary tale of uniformed overreach, India is becoming a cautionary tale of corporatized power capture, with elections continuing as ritual while real authority shifts elsewhere.

That is not development.
That is decay with better optics.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1qbr8tl/pakistan_is_run_by_a_discount_military_india_is/
Trump Imposes 25% Tariffs on All Countries Trading with Iran — Global Markets Shocked,1qbqwtd,1,0,2026-01-13 13:11:10,Neat-Reflection7549,NewsTechandTrands,"Late today, former President Trump announced a sweeping **25% tariff** on any country doing business with Iran.  
This move has sent shockwaves through global markets, with major trading partners like China, India, and Turkey facing immediate pressure.

**Key Points:**  
• 25% tariffs applied to all Iran trade partners 🇺🇸  
• Markets showing increased volatility 📉  
• Major exporters reevaluating strategies

**Discussion:**  
What do you think the long-term impact will be — **economic stability** or deeper **market disruption**?  
Is this more political posturing or a calculated economic strategy?

Islamisation of Panjab,1qbq6wx,1,0,2026-01-13 12:36:25,WearyTear1717,PunjabiMuslim,"As someone aspiring to do Dawah more in India, one thing often i come across is the foreignness of islam and as something alien which really doesn’t lead places when I’m more engaged in aspects of theology and rational.

Looking to understand how Islam actually spread through Punjab across distinct phases rather than the usual broad narrative. The focus is on which tribes or ethnicties if u like shifted in which periods, the local rulers who shaped those transitions, how diff regions moved at different tempos, and the balance between migration driven change and adoption within existing communities due to sufi influence etc. The interest is in the actual historical waves often mentioned (early frontier influence, later Sultanate expansion, Mughal-era consolidation) and how each layer left a different imprint on the social landscape. The goal is to get a clearer sense of how the faith settled into Punjabi society over time rather than viewing it through modern political frames.

What stands out to me is the way people in the early 1900s saw Islam as something woven into their social world rather than as a political badge. The way families could talk about it and the way local traditions blended into it without necessarily crossing the line, the way it sat naturally inside Punjabi identity and not as an Arab thing. That’s the kind of historical texture I’m trying to get a clearer sense of because it feels closer to how communities actually lived the religion before everything became framed through ideology.

"Urgent: College withholding marks card for pending fees, job offer at risk legal options?",1qbq2dg,7,3,2026-01-13 12:30:08,Typical-Win-2430,LegalAdviceIndia,"
I am 30 years old and after many struggles in life, I am finally about to receive a job offer. This opportunity honestly means everything to me. I am not coming from privilege, and it has taken me years to reach this point.
However, my college is now blocking my future.
I completed my course, but due to financial difficulties, my tuition fee is still partially pending. Because of this, the college is refusing to give me my marks card. What’s worse is that they are not even allowing me to take a photocopy or a photo of the marks card, nor are they issuing a bonafide, provisional certificate, or course completion letter.
The employer has asked for basic educational documents for onboarding. Without at least some proof, my job offer may be cancelled. I am not refusing to pay my dues I fully intend to clear them  but right now I urgently need proof of my qualification so I don’t lose this job.
I have politely requested the college multiple times and explained my situation, but they are completely unwilling to cooperate in any form.
At my age, losing this opportunity would be devastating. I’m only asking for temporary access or an official letter so I can secure employment and then clear the dues.
My questions are:
Is it legal for a college in India to withhold marks cards indefinitely due to pending fees?
Can they legally deny even photocopies or provisional/bonafide certificates?
What immediate legal steps can I take to protect my job offer?
Any guidance would mean a lot to me. I’m genuinely stuck and running out of time.

Swiggy Investors: Unions and Politics are BS,1qbpzx8,0,8,2026-01-13 12:26:30,Shoddy-Bite349,StockMarketIndia,"Government is involved because AAP MP Raghav Chadha wants votes from 10 lakh delivery partners. Now they push fake 10-minute delivery ads. Truth: Most take 15-20 minutes. Useless!

Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart do the same quick commerce game. They change rules anytime. Swiggy probably pays politicians.

Thirunavaya Kumbh Mela Stopped Another Case of State Hostility Toward Hindu Religious Revival?,1qborjg,3,11,2026-01-13 11:18:48,SilentResistance7221,KeralaDesham,"Thirunavaya is not just another pilgrimage centre it is one of the most sacred and historically significant Hindu sites in Kerala located on the banks of the Bharathapuzha it was for centuries the largest Hindu pilgrimage hub in Kerala surpassing even Guruvayur in importance during ancient times

Thirunavaya is home to the ancient Navamukunda Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, which is considered one of the most sacred Vaishnava shrines in South India

>It is traditionally regarded as a moksha kshetram, where ritual bathing and worship are believed to grant spiritual liberation

>The site is closely associated with Vedic rituals, yajnas, and Shraddha ceremonies, making it an important centre for ancestral rites in Kerala Hindu tradition

>The Maha Magha Mela, held once every 12 years, was considered auspicious, drawing lakhs of devotees for holy dips in the Bharathapuzha.

>Thirunavaya was the venue of the historic Mamankam Festival, one of the most famous political religious assemblies of medieval Kerala, attended by rulers, scholars, warriors, and pilgrims from across the region

>It functioned as a civilisational meeting point, where religion, governance, martial traditions, and culture intersected

>For centuries, it symbolised the spiritual and cultural heart of Kerala Hindu society


This entire pilgrimage was severely stopped following the invasion of Islamist Tipu Sultan during which temples were destroyed, rituals were halted and Hindu public religious life in the region collapsed as a result, the Maha Magha Mahotsavam gradually stopped as hindus were converted and many fled the region hindus temples were destroyed and hindus were forced to move to cochin and travncore for safety now hindus are Minority in the region

Today after centuries Hindu organisations and Mahamandaleshwars are attempting to revive this ancient Maha Magha pilgrimage, restoring a tradition that once defined Kerala’s Hindu identity

Instead of encouragement, the revival efforts are being blocked by cpim led government to appease a community that is majority in mallpuram

Why is the peaceful revival of an ancient Hindu pilgrimage being obstructed?

Why are traditions that were once destroyed by force now being prevented from returning?

Is the state govt and cpim uncomfortable with the resurgence of Hindu public religious life in historically sensitive regions?

Thirunavaya is not just a place it is a civilisational legacy of malayali Hindus

A tradition that was destroyed by islamist invasions is now being prevented from revival in independent India and kerala by state itself to appease certian group of people the hatred they have for hindus and their tradition is insane ",https://www.reddit.com/r/KeralaDesham/comments/1qborjg/thirunavaya_kumbh_mela_stopped_another_case_of/

The Galactic Council chamber stretched out like a colossus suspended in the vacuum, its walls of translucent energy revealing the vast expanse of the galaxy. Twelve entities, each representing a millennial civilization. In the center, a suspended image: Earth. A blue sphere, beautiful, small. Intrasubstantial according to ancient galactic standards. High Councilor Zhadek broke the silence, a mixture of resignation and a faint hope. ""The Kr’tak have pulverized four stellar systems in this cycle. Forty-two worlds, nine entire civilizations. Nothing we have put in their path stops them. Their 'Hegemony' seeks to expand its control over dark energy, seeks the conversion of planets into power nodes. And they have made it clear they will only stop for what they consider 'worthy' of being studied with caution.""



Councilor Esh-Ka: ""And they will not stop, unless we give them something more valuable than forced submission. Something that intrigues them, that makes them stop and observe. The extraction of dark energy is their ultimate goal, but we can present them with something that alters their usual method. Something that prompts them to scientific curiosity before immediate devastation.""



Everyone knew who she was talking about. Earth.



""That planet was touched by us millennia ago,"" Kron’lar intervened, opening a holographic sequence with ancient images: primitive humans building pyramids under alien direction, engravings with non-human forms, constellations carved in stone. ""They were useful. Obedient. Limited. But now..."" his eyes flashed with an unusual light. ""They have changed. And that change is what could be the key.""



""What do the Earthlings have that the Kr'tak might want?"" asked the young Solari.



Councilor Esh-Ka responded, ""The Geoenergetic Anomaly.""



The young Solari: ""How can a species so young and technologically inferior be of interest to beings with a military power capable of dematerializing entire fleets?""



Esh-Ka replied, ""It is not their defense capability that matters. It is the geoenergetic anomaly of their planet. The Kr'tak seek worlds with unstable telluric flows, planetary cores rich in chaotic electromagnetic pulses that, for some reason, are ideal for the amplification and extraction of dark energy. Most planets in the Milky Way have reached a state of geological equilibrium. Their cores are stable, their magnetic fields predictable.""



""Earth is unique. Its core is not stable; it is a chaotic dynamo of molten magma and currents of metals in constant friction. Its magnetic field fluctuates unpredictably, experiencing periodic inversions that defy our understandings. The Earth's crust itself is fractured into tectonic plates that move and collide constantly, generating earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. All this instability, this chaotic and primal energy, creates a resonance that is rare and valuable for Kr'tak technology."" ""They live short lives, but they advance fast,"" she added, referring to the Earthlings. ""And the most fascinating thing is that their very existence is intrinsically linked to this instability. Their civilization has flourished on a planet that should have been geologically inhospitable for complex life and in a constant state of change. It is this peculiar interaction between life and such a volatile planet that we believe intrigues the Kr'tak. Not only for the amount of dark energy it can produce, but for the singularity of its fluctuation and the interaction of that fluctuation with organic life. It is a natural laboratory of what they seek.""



There was a reverent silence, a moment of profound reflection on the audacity of humanity in its insignificance. It was the same chaotic nature that the Council had despised, which they now offered as their only hope.



Finally, Zhadek spoke: ""We will give them Earth. It will be our offering. Its geoenergetic singularity, its seismic unpredictability, and the incredible resilience of the life it harbors will satiate their 'hunger' for a time, but in a different way. Earth is a living laboratory of the unknown, an anomaly that the Kr'tak Hegemony, in its search for dark energy, will not be able to ignore. They will be intrigued by the enigma of how such a chaotic planet can harbor life, and that will give us time to understand them, to perhaps find a weakness in their technology or, at least, force a negotiation before the entire Milky Way is reduced to a field of dark energy.""



Everyone knew that gaining time was their only option. The hope was that scientific intrigue, not devastation, would be the first response of the Kr'tak Hegemony toward Earth.



But in the darkest corners of the room, in whispers silenced by protocol, a doubt persisted: What if the Earthlings were not as fragile as they believed? What if their geological ""rarity"" and their own resilient nature were a double-edged sword, capable of thwarting those who tried to harvest it, or of inspiring an unexpected resistance against the implacable Hegemony?



Chapter 3: The Deliberation of Emperor Xy'lar's High Command



Location: War Chambers of the Supreme Dreadnought ""Star Devourer,"" Kr'tak Vanguard Fleet



Time: Days after the Galactic Council's vote



The War Chambers of the Supreme Dreadnought were not a place of luxury, but of cold and efficient functionality. Great holographic screens displayed star maps and tactical projections. At the center of a polished obsidian table, the Great Emperor Xy'lar, an imposing figure with dark metallic plate armor and eyes that glowed with a dull internal light, observed the projection of a small blue orb: Earth.



Around him, seated in chairs designed for their massive physiology, were the other members of the Kr'tak High Command: General Th'rak, a renowned military strategist; Admiral Veyl, master of the invisible fleets; and Lord Scientist Zarkon, one of the minds behind dark energy technology. There were no unnecessary ornaments, only the harsh reality of their hegemony.



""The Milky Way Council has responded to us,"" Emperor Xy'lar's voice resonated in the chamber. It was not a shout, but a declaration that demanded attention. ""They offer a world. This world: local designation, 'Earth'.""



General Th'rak spoke: ""An offering? After seeing how we pulverized the Kael'thax Sector. Do they believe a single planet will stop us?""



""It is an act of desperation, General,"" replied Admiral Veyl, his voice restrained. ""Our incursions have sown terror. They know they have no defenses against us. It is their last, pathetic attempt to buy time.""



Lord Scientist Zarkon leaned toward the hologram of Earth. ""This planet is peculiar. Our long-range scans revealed a significant geoenergetic anomaly. An exceptionally unstable core, with massive magnetic fluctuations and chaotic tectonic activity. It is a promising source for dark energy generation. In fact, one of the most potent candidates we have found in this galaxy.""



""But the problem persists,"" Zarkon continued, his voice taking on a tone of irritation. ""The surface is saturated with a constant pattern of biotechnological interference. Billions of entities—the Earthlings—have covered the planet with communication networks, power systems, and the electromagnetic pulse of their own minds. Most alarmingly: they have developed a rudimentary but effective technology to dampen and modulate the flows of dark energy coming from the planetary core. Their 'protection' could directly interfere with our extraction methods.""



The Great Emperor Xy'lar did not flinch. His voice echoed in the chamber with the firmness of an ancestral decree:



""Their systems generate noise, yes, and contaminate the flow. They destabilize our processes and cause unstable feedback in the collection nodes. But they are not a real obstacle. We only need to neutralize their resonant field using our spectral probes in a focused manner from orbit. Nothing justifies a landing. The Earthlings lack the capacity to oppose our system.""



""The Galactic Council's proposal, then, is a tacit admission,"" General Th'rak intervened. ""They offer us this world knowing its core is of primary interest to our Hegemony. It is their form of appeasement, of saying: 'Take it, get what you seek, and leave us in peace'.""



Admiral Veyl nodded. ""Proceeding with a total purge involving direct bombardment of the planet would not be risky even with that dampening technology the Earthlings made for their own survival.""



""However,"" added Lord Scientist Zarkon, ""the existence of that dampening technology demonstrates an instinctive understanding of dark energy that is, frankly, surprising for such a primitive species. Although their method is crude, the way they manage to modulate the Earth's core fluctuations is fascinating.""



Then, the Guardian of the Archives, a figure with intricately engraved ceremonial armor, questioned with a tone of political skepticism: ""Do we accept their offering?""



""We do not trust their morality, Guardian,"" responded Great Emperor Xy'lar, his voice now deeper, almost a rumble. ""We trust their fear. They have seen what we do. They know we have no mercy. By offering Earth and, by implication, accepting the elimination of its inhabitants, they demonstrate to us that they value the survival of their galaxy above a species they consider irrelevant. It is a deal that, although repulsive to them, is advantageous to us.""



""The offering is strategically logical,"" Admiral Veyl decreed. ""It saves us time and resources. It gives us an exceptionally potent source of dark energy, allowing for focused extraction from the atmosphere without the need for an inefficient purge that could compromise the integrity of the source itself. Our absorption technology is so advanced that the small 'disturbances' of the surface are insignificant. And we can study how that suppression technology reacts while absorbing their world, even if it is primitive. There are no significant disadvantages for the Hegemony.""



Great Emperor Xy'lar stood up, his shadow projecting long over the holographic table. ""The Kr'tak Hegemony accepts the offering of the Milky Way Council. We will proceed with total and immediate absorption; the 'noise' or Earthling difficulty will represent no obstacle at all. Let this demonstration of our superiority drive the rest of the galaxy into submission. Earth will be ours, and its dark energy will fuel our expansion for eons.""



The Kr'tak High Command responded with a reverent silence, a collective nod to the will of their Emperor. Earth, a small blue dot in the immensity, was now condemned by its own existence. The great machine of the Hegemony was already moving, waiting only for the signal that its ""offering"" had been ""accepted.""

Chapter 4: The Blindness of the Council



Location: Stellar Chamber of the Galactic Council



Time: Minutes after the conclusion of the transmission with the Kr'tak High Command



The holo-map of the galaxy faded, leaving the Stellar Chamber in a tense silence, broken only by the soft hum of life support systems. The twelve representatives remained on their thrones. The coldness of the decision had settled, giving way to a sharp self-questioning.



High Councilor Zhadek, the Xantari, broke the silence, his voice low and heavy with bitter understanding. ""We have done it. We have delivered a world. We have condemned billions. And what is most humiliating is that the Kr'tak Hegemony seems to know more about Earth and its true nature than we ourselves knew. How is it possible?""



Councilor Shayari T’au, with palpable frustration, nodded slowly. ""Lord Scientist Zarkon of the Kr’tak mentioned 'biotechnological interference.' The Earthlings' ability to 'dampen' and 'modulate' the dark energy flows of their own core. We only classified it as a geological anomaly and environmental 'noise'! How is it that they, the Kr'tak, identified it as technology, however rudimentary it may be?""



""Precisely,"" growled Ambassador Kron'lar, with a gesture of deep annoyance. ""We, the guardians of this galaxy, were blind to the singularity they had right under our noses. Too busy with the great powers, with large-scale conflicts. We dismissed the small, the 'irrelevant.' It is an error we should never have committed.""



Councilor Krain moved on his throne, the usual rigidity of his posture compromised by growing unease. ""Our archives on Earth are sparse beyond our initial visits. We recorded their biological evolution, their conflicts over territory; they were considered a war-fanatic but primitive species, using rudimentary tools. Any data on geoenergetic anomalies was classified as a natural phenomenon without galactic relevance, or simply 'noise' in the system. We never delved deeper. We never investigated the interaction between that 'anomaly' and the life on the surface.""



""And yet, that 'noise' is the key,"" interrupted the young Solari diplomat. ""The Kr'tak call it 'biotechnological interference.' They saw what we did not. How could a species that barely explored its own moon not only coexist with such a chaotic core but also develop a capacity to 'modulate' those flows? It is a capacity that, in its uniqueness, surpasses even us.""



The young Solari diplomat, still shocked by the fate of Earth, dared to ask: ""Could it be that by living on a planet with such unique geoenergetic instability, their own evolution forced them to develop an understanding or interaction with dark energy that we, in our stable worlds, never had the need to explore? Perhaps their 'primitiveness' is not a weakness, but an adaptive strength?""



Zhadek considered the question, his eyes deep in thought. ""It is a bold hypothesis, young Solari, but logically plausible. Our genetic and cultural analyses of the Earthlings always qualified them as surprisingly adaptable and resilient. If their planet is, in fact, such a chaotic dynamo of dark energy, it is logical to assume that life there would have developed, consciously or unconsciously, mechanisms to coexist with it. Not as an advanced technology, but as an evolutionary response to their environment.""



""Then, that 'dampening technology' Zarkon spoke of would not be a great scientific breakthrough in our sense, but an almost instinctive response, born from the need for extreme survival,"" Kron’lar added. ""They did not seek to exploit dark energy, but to neutralize it so as not to be destroyed by it. An innate defense of their own ecosystem. What to us were 'signals of a noisy civilization,' to the Kr'tak was the modulation of a vital resource.""



The Solari spoke again, now more thoughtful than worried. ""If so, their 'ingenuity' lies not in sophistication, but in pure adaptation. The Kr'tak, in their search for dark energy, do not seek 'life,' but the 'resource.' And they have identified that life on Earth, with its 'interference,' is not an obstacle to efficient extraction... but what if it is? The arrogance of the Kr'tak makes them think they can absorb it with ease, but what if that is not the case?""



""It is a bitter irony,"" said Kron'lar. ""While we sent probes that cataloged them as 'irrelevant,' its inhabitants, in their struggle for survival, developed an interaction with a cosmic force that we barely understand in its entirety. Their own struggle made them unique, and that singularity is their doom.""



Zhadek observed the static projection of Earth. ""The Kr'tak have taught us a harsh lesson. Our trust in our pre-established categories and our lack of attention to the 'small' has led us to a breaking point. Now, the question is: what implications does this have? If the human presence is an interference for the Kr'tak, and that same 'interference' is an adaptive response to dark energy... what happens if, by some remote possibility, the Kr'tak do not manage to 'clean them out' as easily as their arrogance makes them believe?""



The room fell into silence once again. This time, it was a silence of profound uncertainty. They had delivered Earth as bait, convinced that its ""cleaning"" would be quick and efficient. But the idea that the very anomaly of Earth that made it valuable to the Kr'tak could also be its unexpected resistance was a possibility that now loomed over them. A possibility they had underestimated, as so many other times, when judging the Earthlings.



Chapter 5: The Countdown



Location: Stellar Chamber of the Galactic Council



Time: Minutes after the previous dialogue



The silence in the Stellar Chamber was denser now, a heavy burden upon each of the galactic leaders. The conversation with the Kr'tak had left them not only with the decision to condemn a world, but with the bitter revelation of their own blindness.



""It is done,"" the voice of High Councilor Zhadek, the Xantari, resonated with raw honesty. ""We have delivered Earth. The Kr'tak have accepted it. But the Lord Scientist of the Hegemony was not lying about that 'biotechnological interference.' For them, Earth is not a simple resource; it is a source of dark energy that is chaotic and full of 'noise'.""



""The question now is not our error,"" said Ambassador Kron'lar. ""The question is: What is our next move? What are we going to do with the time we have gained, if we have gained any at all?""



Councilor Lyra activated a tactical projection, and a flashing red dot—the Kr'tak fleet—appeared approaching Earth. ""Our latest readings indicate that the vanguard of the Hegemony is only three days away. Their advance is relentless.""



""Three days?"" Xel’mor exclaimed with palpable incredulity. ""It is but a breath! We barely have time to digest this revelation.""



""Three days is what we have to 'analyze the situation',"" Zhadek affirmed with a gravity that chilled the air. ""The Kr'tak expect the 'cleaning' of Earth to be carried out. For them, that means the end of all life and technology on the surface. And if that 'cleaning' does not occur... or, even more, if that terrestrial 'interference' turns out to be more powerful than they anticipate...""



Archivist Krain, moving with unusual urgency, intervened. ""Councilor, I have been reviewing the 'discarded' records regarding Earth. There are sporadic mentions of anomalous seismic events and, crucially, of 'counter-frequency waves' emanating from the planet's surface. At the time, we considered them minor geological phenomena or unimportant primitive technology. But now, with what we know from the Kr'tak about the 'modulation' of dark energy...""



The conversation turned toward the logistics of extraction, but the Solari diplomat, with the image of Earth still burned into his mind, could not shake an idea from his head. He questioned again, with a new urgency in his voice: ""I still insist. Considering what we know now about the Earthlings' ability to modulate the energetic flows of their own world... is it possible that the very geoenergetic instability the Hegemony seeks to exploit has been, paradoxically, the forge of a unique adaptive advantage for them? What we see as rudimentary technology—what if it is just the tip of the iceberg of a deep and vital interaction with dark energy that our 'advanced' civilization never had to develop?""



""It is a logical hypothesis, young Solari,"" Zhadek nodded, a strange spark of interest in his eyes. ""If the Kr'tak, with all their power, were to encounter difficulties in extracting energy from Earth due to this 'interference,' then the 'cleaning' will not be simple for them. The Earthlings' very capacity to adapt and survive their chaotic planet could be what prevents the pure extraction the Kr'tak need.""



A Poisoned Gift: The True Threat of Earth



The silence, dense and charged, took hold of the Stellar Chamber once more. The Solari diplomat's revelation and Zhadek's confirmation loomed over them like an uncomfortable truth. They had delivered Earth, not as a simple planet, but as a complex energetic puzzle.



Councilor Lyra’s tactical projection now showed a series of anomalous readings emanating from Earth, invisible to the Council's eyes until recently. ""Exactly. What to them is a simple cleaning to obtain pure dark matter could become a fierce struggle. Earth is not a mere deposit; it is a living being that has developed the capacity to modulate the dark energy surrounding it, perhaps even to resist its forced extraction.""



""This is much more than a setback,"" Ambassador Kron'lar growled with concern. ""If the Kr'tak cannot obtain Earth's dark matter in the 'pure' form they need, their primary objective is compromised. And a frustrated Kr'tak is an even more dangerous Kr'tak.""



Zhadek closed his eyes for a moment, the magnitude of his error echoing in the chamber. ""We have offered a poisoned gift. The Kr'tak trust that Earth will provide them with a quick and efficient solution to their 'energy problem.' They do not anticipate that the planet itself is an unpredictable biotechnological fortress. They believe they are about to harvest their most valuable resource, but instead, they might be about to unleash a force that not even they can fully understand.""



Archivist Krain, his gaze fixed on the projected data, added in a grave voice: ""The records of those 'counter-frequency waves' and anomalous seismic events take on a new and terrifying meaning. If the Earthlings' capacity to interact with dark energy is so deep, the 'cleaning' of Earth might not be a simple eradication. It could be a clash of energetic forces that destabilizes the Hegemony's own advance.""



""And therein lies the greater problem,"" Zhadek concluded, his voice low but filled with renewed urgency. ""The Kr'tak might not only fail in their attempt to obtain dark matter, but Earth's energetic reaction could be catastrophic for their technology and their own energetic structures. Our 'offering' of Earth, intended to appease them, could be the spark that ignites a conflict far more devastating for them, and for the rest of the galaxy.""



The hope, so fleeting, dissolved into a new and terrifying truth. The time gained was not for the Council's survival, but to witness the possible collapse of the Kr'tak Hegemony, dragging down who knows how many galaxies with it. Earth, a planet they had condemned, now revealed itself as an energetic unknown capable of altering the balance of power in the galaxy.



""Then,"" the Solari concluded, with a new urgency in his voice, ""we must prepare for the worst. If the Kr'tak cannot 'clean' Earth, they will not retreat. Most likely, they will attempt an even more brutal and complete annihilation to entirely eliminate the source of 'noise.' And in that case, the Milky Way will have lost its only bargaining chip.""



The Council looked at each other, the urgency of the situation weighing on their faces. Three days to decipher an enigma they had ignored for millennia. Three days to find a crack in the Kr'tak's armor, hidden in the surprising resilience of the very species they had just condemned.



Chapter 6: The Shadow on the Horizon



Location: Situation Room, Pentagon, Washington D.C.



Time: Two days after the Galactic Council's vote



The air in the Pentagon Situation Room was thick, charged with the same tension that was being replicated in underground bunkers and command centers thousands of kilometers away. The holographic screens, which normally displayed military maps or economic data, now projected a haunting image: a series of gravitational anomalies and massive energy fluctuations, moving at an impossible speed through deep space.



Around the globe, a secure communication network linked the leaders of every nation recognized by the UN, connected in an unprecedented virtual emergency summit. Although only a few powers would speak directly, every country, without exception, was present, ready to contribute resources, infrastructure, or cooperation according to their capabilities.



General Vance, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, broke the silence: ""Forty-eight hours ago, our long-range observatories, followed by those in Argentina, China, Russia, and India, detected this. An unprecedented energy signature. It is not a conventional fleet; it does not fit any known profile.""



From a secure link, the voice of President Li Na, head of the People's Liberation Army of China, sounded with unusual gravity: ""Our spatial distortion detection systems recorded a gravitational shockwave that does not correspond to any natural phenomenon. It is an anomaly of artificial origin, and it is gigantic. At this rate, and based on the projected trajectory, they will arrive in approximately a day and a half.""



On another screen, Marshal Kuznetsov, of the Russian Armed Forces, nodded, his face stern: ""Our surveillance satellites, the ones we use to monitor the anomalous fluctuations of the Earth's core, have also detected an intense disturbance in the vacuum in the direction of the approach. It is as if they are 'folding' space itself to propel themselves. It is a technology that escapes our understanding.""



The Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom, Lady Eleanor Finch, joined the conversation: ""Our preliminary analyses suggest they are not using fusion or antimatter propulsion. It is something more... fundamental. The scale of the energy signatures is such that, if they were conventional ships, they would be the size of moons. This is something different, something that distorts the very fabric of space.""



From Buenos Aires, the President of Argentina, Dr. Ricardo Solís, joined the link, his face pale but resolute: ""Our scientists have noted a direct correlation between the intensity of this 'signature' and the anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field. It is as if this external force were 'resonating' with the energy of our own core. It is unsettling.""



A harsh, emotionless voice was heard from Pyongyang. General Kim Chol-su, of North Korea, declared: ""Our long-range radars detect a massive but diffuse presence. There are no clear shapes, only a disturbance in space. It is like a shadow approaching. A shadow we cannot target.""



From Paris, the President of France, Emmanuel Laurent, intervened with sobriety: ""Our observatory in French Guiana has detected similar fluctuations. We will coordinate with the ESA to deploy emergency probes. If it is a life form, we must try to understand it... even if it is too late.""



From Berlin, the Chancellor of Germany, Ingrid Weber, added in a dry tone: ""Our scientific team suggests that this phenomenon distorts not only space, but local time around it. There are delays in quantum signals, as if reality itself were pre-empting its arrival.""



From Tokyo, the Japanese Prime Minister, Takahiro Matsu, spoke with tense calm: ""Japanese aerospace defense agencies have cross-referenced data with South Korea and Australia. We agree that this is not simply advanced technology. It is a presence that alters physical laws. Perhaps even conscious.""



General Sharma, from India, with a tone of concern in his voice, added: ""Our combat simulations are useless. We cannot predict the behavior of a force we cannot see or understand. Our defense systems are designed for known threats; this is the unknown. And it is approaching at a speed that leaves us without conventional defensive options.""



General Vance responded: ""The implication is clear. Whatever it is, it is an existential threat. And we do not have the tools to stop it with brute force. We cannot face them in space.""



He paused, his gaze sweeping over the faces of the leaders.



""Our only option is planetary defense. We must activate all Earth protection protocols. Deploy atmospheric energy shields, redirect all the power of our defense grids toward the surface. If we cannot stop them outside, we must make Earth as inhospitable as possible for their arrival.""



Marshal Kuznetsov nodded: ""We will activate our orbital defense systems, although their effectiveness is uncertain. The priority is the integrity of the atmosphere and the crust. If they manage to land or deploy weapons, the damage will be catastrophic.""



""We will mobilize our populations to underground shelters,"" said President Li Na. ""And we will prepare our anti-aircraft defenses for any target that materializes in the atmosphere. It is a desperate measure, but it is all we have.""



Lady Finch added: ""Our scientists must work without rest to analyze every micro-fluctuation of that signature. Any weakness, any pattern. We need to understand what is approaching if we want to have the slightest hope of surviving.""



President Solís, from Argentina, nodded with determination: ""Our geoenergetic monitoring network, the same one that detects internal anomalies, will be on maximum alert. If this external force interacts with our planet's energy, we must detect it and, perhaps, find a way to use it in our favor. It is our only hope, however remote.""



From the muted monitors, leaders of more than 180 countries remained in direct connection. From small island states to regional powers in Africa, the Middle East, and South America, everyone listened, everyone recorded, everyone prepared, with whatever resources they had, to play their part in what was no longer a war, but a global defense of last resort.



Silence fell again, this time heavier, more oppressive. The world's military and economic powers, accustomed to dominating their own destiny, were facing something that surpassed them completely. Something approaching from the darkness, which, in their own words, had no shape or name—only a growing shadow on the horizon.



And they had less than two days to prepare.

Chapter 7: The Echo of Defiance



Location: Joint South American Command Center, Underground Complex No. 7, Buenos Aires, Argentina.



Time: Less than a day before arrival.



The tension in the Joint Command Center was almost unbearable. The screens showed the growing shadow of the extraterrestrial fleet, now only hours away. Scientists and military personnel from the world powers moved with frantic efficiency, every face lined with exhaustion and anxiety.



President Ricardo Solís of Argentina watched the imminent horizon.



""Our distortion detection systems confirm that the object's speed has not decreased,"" an analyst reported with a tense voice. ""Estimated impact in twelve hours.""



The President of the United States, Maxwell, spoke: ""We have no capacity to stop them. All our orbital defenses are ready to intercept, but it will be a symbolic gesture.""



""A gesture we must make,"" replied Marshal Kuznetsov from Moscow, in the emergency videoconference gathering more than 190 leaders and representatives of UN member states, each transmitting from their respective national command centers.



It was then that President Solís responded:



""We have spoken of resistance. Of defense. But what about communication? We have not tried to speak to them.""



A young Indian scientist looked up. ""Sir, we have been preparing a sequence of pulses based on universal mathematical foundations. It is our best chance to establish that we are an intelligence. We want to send a message.""



""A message of existence?"" asked a voice from South Africa.



""No,"" Solís replied. ""Not just of existence. Of determination."" He turned toward the leaders on the screens: from Berlin, Washington, Beijing, London, New Delhi, Ottawa, Mexico City, and dozens more.



""We cannot stop them with brute force. But we can send a message. One that makes it clear that we are not an empty planet. That this Earth is inhabited. And that they are not welcome to destruction.""



A silence fell over the global network. It was a wild idea, almost suicidal. To provoke an unstoppable force?



The President of Mexico, Roberto Fuentes, from Mexico City, broke the silence. ""President Solís, what kind of message do you propose? An ultimatum? A threat we cannot back up?""



""No,"" Solís replied, his voice firm. ""A clear message. Concise. One that says: 'Go back where you came from. This planet does not desire you. You are not welcome here.' We will send it using a language of primary pulses that, we hope, any advanced intelligence can decode as a direct declaration.""



From Manila, the firm voice of the President of the Philippines was heard. ""If we are to be destroyed, let them at least know that this planet had a voice. That we were not mere victims, but conscious beings with a will. We support the transmission. Let it be heard from every island, mountain, and continent on Earth.""



General Kim Chol-su of North Korea nodded. ""An act of dignity. A last word before the end. I support it.""



President Maxwell looked at Solís through the screen, then at the screens showing the approaching shadow. It was madness, but also the only option that didn't involve simply waiting for the impact. ""Do it. Redirect maximum power to all our large radio telescopes and communication networks. Transmit the message in a continuous loop. Let it be heard loud and clear!""



Location: Command Bridge of the Supreme Dreadnought ""Star Devourer,"" Kr'tak Vanguard Fleet.



Time: Eleven hours before reaching the Earth's atmosphere.



Within the opaque darkness of the bridge, stellar projections danced around Great Emperor Xy'lar and his High Command. The planet Earth grew larger on the main screen.



""Lord Scientist Zarkon,"" Emperor Xy'lar uttered, his voice a deep murmur. ""Any update on the 'interference' of that world? Is the 'noise' still so high?""



Zarkon, his hands manipulating a console: ""Yes, Emperor. In fact, the 'noise' pattern has become more structured. Our systems have detected a sequence of energy pulses directed straight at our fleet. It is a mathematical pattern, unmistakable.""



""A message?"" Admiral Veyl asked with a hint of contempt. ""From such an inferior species? What have they tried to communicate?""

Tournament of Shadows – a Gaslight-era Call of Cthulhu campaign (1890s),1qbnu9d,12,9,2026-01-13 10:23:20,jammer0501,callofcthulhu,"https://preview.redd.it/wvqz2h84g3dg1.jpg?width=953&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0ae1b46c7971c43c25a5ac3a61aa76b177a52d

I’ve recently finished and released *Tournament of Shadows*, a full Gaslight-era Call of Cthulhu campaign I’ve been working on for a long time, and I wanted to share it here for anyone who enjoys historically grounded cosmic horror and hasn't come across it already.

It’s very much written in the grand tradition of **Masks of Nyarlathotep** and **Horror on the Orient Express**  \- those were the campaigns that made me fall in love with Call of Cthulhu and made me realise what could really be done with TTRPGs, and how unique Call of Cthulhu was at the time.

Set in the 1890s, the campaign unfolds across London, British India, and Ottoman Syria, blending real historical pressures - empire, espionage, archaeology, political unrest - with Mythos elements that escalate slowly and deliberately. It’s built as a true long-form investigation rather than a loose anthology, with recurring NPCs, faction play, and consequences that carry forward across continents.

Each book can be run independently if you want to lift locations, NPCs, or plot threads, but the campaign is designed to be experienced as a single unfolding narrative. The tone leans toward grounded horror, moral pressure, and dread but would also lend itself to Pulp.

I’m happy to answer questions about structure, tone, or how it runs at the table if anyone’s curious. This has very much been a labour-of-love project, and I’d genuinely like to hear what people think.

IIM BANGALORE Interview transcript shared by a student.,1qbnssp,5,0,2026-01-13 10:20:54,Mother_Yellow8994,CATiim,"


Date: 25th February 2020
Place: IIM Bangalore, Bengaluru
Time: 2 p.m.



My First Interview
Background:-
General Engineering Male Fresher
CAT: 99.96 percentile (VARC: 99.62/DILR: 99.92/Quant: 99.59)
Graduation: 9.62 CGPA, EEE at NITK Surathkal
12th: 96.83% (as per CAT form considering all subjects)- CBSE 2016
10th: 10 CGPA- CBSE 2014



IIM Bangalore requires us to prepare a 600 word SOP and get two Letter of Recommendations. I prepared my SOP, taking a lot of help from my mother. I mentioned my academics, my little co-curricular achievements, my love for professional wrestling, a penchant for tracking box office collection of films and whatever little to no positions of responsibility I held in college. I also mentioned why I wanted to do an MBA. After several edits, I thought it was decently prepared and made it exactly 600 words, for some reason. I got my Letter of Recommendations from two Electrical and Electronics professors in my college, one being my major project instructor and the other my favourite teacher who had taught me 4 courses. During the interview, the panelists have a tablet and read the SOPs.



WAT: On the Lines of Importance of Saving Things quoting an Environmentalist. 10 minutes to write down points and 20 to write. One side of a ruled sheet was for rough work and three fourth of one side for writing. I finished early, just as everyone did, and for some reason, scribbled to the very end of the page. My handwriting was also much smaller and much more congested than it usually is.



P2: So Archit, Sahay is a Bihari surname, how come you have a Delhi address?
Me: My family is ethnically Bihari and Jharkhandi but I've lived at various places owing to the transferrable nature of my father's job. Currently, we live in Delhi where I've spent most of my life.
P3: Some Ranchi connection as well?
Me: Yes sir, I did my 10th and 12th there. In fact, I studied there from 8th to 12th.
P3: So you got to see Dhoni's bikes, he loves them doesn't he?
Me: I saw his house from outside multiple times and have heard a lot about his bikes but, haven't seen them. (Smiling)
P2: So Archit, you study Electrical and Electronics at NITK. So I'm sure companies such as Texas, Schneider, Nvidia, etc. would have come. So why did you opt for Wells Fargo?
Me: Sir, it's not that I didn't try for them. I had tried for 3-4 such companies but couldn't get an internship. Then Wells came along and I got there. I wasn't very sure what I wanted to do back then, I liked both paths.
P2: So, Wells must be paying you somewhere around 15 lakhs which is pretty good?
Me: Almost that much sir.
P2: So why opt for Wells particularly and eventually MBA then? You said you liked your branch, got a job in a different field?
Me: (I was prepared to rehash my ‘Why MBA’ answer and tell, but, God knows what got into me and this happened...)
Sir, I am interested in box office collections of films so...
P1: Oh, that's interesting. So you know about this year's Oscars and watched the films that got awarded this time?
Me: Sir, I haven't watched them. I know Parasite won Best Movie and the Korean director won the best director award. Brad Pitt won the best-supporting actor for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I plan on watching Parasite soon.
P1: So you don't watch movies?
Me: I do, but very few, I'm more interested in their collections. (Sounds strange but it's true :( ).
P1: That's peculiar. How much did Parasite earn?
Me: I'm not very sure sir, it's been re-released and is at about 200 million worldwide right now (which was true at the time but, I said it like I was guessing). I'm more into collections of Indian films.
P2: So what's the highest-grossing Indian film?
Me: It's Dangal sir, but it's collections are skewed due to the majority coming from China from a Mandarin version. In India, or including only Indian languages, it's Bahubali the Conclusion.
P2: What about Sholay?
Me: Sholay was the highest-grossing movie in its time Sir, it sold about 10-155 crore tickets which is the highest ever.
P2: But, Dangal earned more right?
Me: That is because of inflation sir...
P3: How would you explain the difference in the collections of Dangal and Sholay?
Me: Sir, inflation...
P3: Forget inflation, what else has changed since.
Me: Sir, we could compare them on the basis of the number of tickets sold but that wouldn't be fair as today there are a lot more ways to watch a movie. We have streaming services and a lot more content...
P3: Forget streaming services and all...
P2: Assume everything else is the same, which was a bigger hit?
Me: Sir, we could use the average ticket price...
P3: You're not getting the question. If I say you're not selected, you won't feel good, would you! How would you explain an average person sitting across the table for tea which was a bigger hit apart from inflation and considering only films, not other content?
Me: Sir, today there are many more screens in India than there were then. Also, a lot are multiplexes, which generate even higher revenue. So, even adjusting for price rise wouldn't be correct and we have to consider a combination of all these factors.
P3: You're not nervous are you, are you alright?
Me: Yes sir.
P2: Okay Archit, so you've read about Wells Fargo, where you got placed?
Me: Yes sir, it was founded in the mid-nineteenth century by Henry Wells and William Fargo during the California gold rush as a transportation...
P2: Not that old baba, tell me recent news, it has been in the news for some fines, do you follow news about it?
Me: (I thought, better to address the elephant in the room right away)
I don't follow it's news sir, but, I know it had a scandal where a lot of fake accounts were created a few years ago after which it fell from being the World's largest bank to today the fourth largest...
P2: So, why did you intern there if you knew about the scandal?
Me: Sir, they made sure to tell us nothing like that would ever happen again. Even while working there, I was convinced as to how they handled the situation and...
P2: So, you'll also open fake accounts if you're ordered to?
Me: I will not sir.
P2: Let me make it more difficult for you, would you do so if your promotion and a lot of job perks depended on it?
P3: Assuming your salary would get doubled?
Me: No sir. I don't think with my current moral values I would ever do that.
P2: Okay, thank you, hey, wait... Do you want to ask us something?
Me: (Blurted out my prepared answer which was stupid in hindsight)
Sir, how are the interview dates decided once we get a call? I couldn't find any correlation...
P2: Oh, here?
Me: Yes sir.
P2: They must ask you to fill a form and accordingly they'll arrange as per your preference. (Speaking as if it was the most obvious thing on Earth. Also, we don't get to prefer dates).
Me: Okay sir.
P2: Thank you
I thanked everyone and left.



Result: Waitlisted at 179, which is a polite way of rejecting as waitlists move about 50-70 here.



Conclusion: I went on studying a lot of different topics ranging from my branch to all the places I'd lived at to GK and had remembered facts just like most people. I had a well-rehearsed answer for 'Introduce Yourself', 'Why MBA?' and had thought of the silly question I asked them if given the opportunity. Going in, the interview turned out to be more behavioral. In hindsight, I was like an overfit algorithm, who couldn't adapt. The grilling on box office had derailed me and I had lost all my facials since and spoke with very little confidence and voice modulation. So, this disaster happened. I am the only one to blame for this, after appearing for so many interviews I, therefore, believe that the most important thing is to portray ourselves the way we are and convey that properly to the interviewer. Here, I came out lamenting that they might have misinterpreted me several times and that I should have said a lot of things differently. For Wells, I had never thought that they'd ask about the scandal. But, I feel I should have given them credit for conducting several mandatory trainings on ethics. Also, I should have told them that I interned as a data analyst and opening accounts was far from what I did there. Despite having a good percentile, I failed to convert. This was also considering that I had been allotted the best mentor I could have, who helped me as much as anyone could. (Thankfully I could make good use of her guidance later). On the optimistic side, it taught me to not be over-prepared in terms of content, and be adaptable. It taught me not to approach an interview like an examination and hopefully, I learned this well for the subsequent interviews. My only regret today, about things beyond my control, is that it would have been much better if my first interview was for not as good a college so that I would have learned this lesson before the Bangalore interview.
P.S.: Thankfully, I converted Ahmedabad

### ✅ **Why Students Take It Lightly**

1. **“It’s Just Theory” Mindset**
   Students think it’s just cramming events, dates, and names. They underestimate the *skills* needed like interpretation, analysis, and exam technique.

2. **Language Confidence = False Security**
   If you’re good at English, you might assume you can “write your way through” the paper — which is *very* wrong. The examiner isn't looking at your words, they ask for you to hit the points in the mark scheme.

3. **Past Paper Neglect**
   Many students only start solving past papers 2–3 weeks before exams, not realizing how specific the *marking scheme expectations* are.

4. **Confusing It with General Knowledge**
   Students think if they know Pakistan’s basic history (Partition, Quaid-e-Azam, wars), they’ll be fine. But Pak Studies is more academic and exam-focused than casual history.

---

### 🚫 **What Students Commonly Get Wrong**

1. **Lack of Factual Precision**
   They write vague or emotional answers like ""He was a great leader..."" or ""This helped Muslims a lot"" — and lose marks because the answer lacked *specific facts, causes, or consequences*.

2. **No Structure in Answers**
   Especially for longer questions (4, 7, or 14 marks), students don’t follow structure. Many just narrate facts instead of *answering the question directly with reasons and evaluation*.

3. **Confusing Cause, Event, and Consequence**
   E.g., when asked *why the Khilafat Movement failed*, they describe *what happened during it* instead of *why it failed*.

4. **Ignoring the Command Words**
   They write “explain” answers for “describe” questions or “list” answers for “why” questions. This hurts grades a lot.

5. **Weak Time Management**
   They spend too long on Section A or write too much on early questions, and then rush through the 14-mark question — which carries the most weight.

---

### 🧠 **How to Actually Get an A or A\***

#### 1. **Master the Format**

* Know what to expect:

  * **Paper 1 (History)**: Source-based and structured questions.
  * Focused on 1857–1947 (or 1947–1999 depending on syllabus stream).
* Practice each type of question:

  * **4-mark Describe** → 2 solid points
  * **7-mark Explain** → 3 explained points
  * **14-mark Judgment** → Intro + 3–4 points + judgment

#### 2. **Use PEEL/PEE Structure**

* **P**oint
* **E**xample/Evidence
* **E**xplanation
* (Optional **L**ink for longer questions)

**E.g.,**

> One reason the Lucknow Pact was important was that it showed Hindu-Muslim cooperation.
> For example, both Congress and the Muslim League agreed on a united demand to the British.
> This was significant because it gave hope for political unity and mutual respect.

#### 3. **Memorize with Purpose**

* Don't just cram. Understand:

  * **Causes** of events
  * **Consequences** (short and long term)
  * **Importance** — what changed? who was affected? how?

#### 4. **Highlight Dates, Treaties, Names**

* Use them naturally in your answers. Don’t just throw them in — *tie them to your explanation*.

**E.g.,**

> The Nehru Report (1928) proposed a single secular India, which Muslims rejected, leading to the Fourteen Points in 1929.

#### 5. **Get Source Skills Locked**

* Practice:

  * *Inference* (what can be learned)
  * *Purpose* (why it was made)
  * *Reliability* (who made it, when, bias?)
  * *Cross-reference* with knowledge

#### 6. **Revise Smart**

* Use revision books like:

  * *Nigel Kelly's O Level History of Pakistan*
  * *Oxford University Press: The History and Culture of Pakistan*
* Flashcards → key events + causes + years
* Timeline → major events in order

#### 7. **Practice Past Papers with Marking Schemes**

* Don’t just write — *compare* with marking scheme
* Learn how many **distinct points**, how much **depth**, and where **evaluation** is expected

#### 8. **14-Mark Killer Tip**

* Answer the question **from both sides**
* Then give a clear **final judgment** — no fence-sitting
* Use phrases like:

  * ""However, the most important factor was...""
  * ""Despite this, it is clear that...""
  * ""Although X played a role, Y was more influential because...""

---

### 🔥 Final Secret Sauce for A/A\*

* Treat it like a science subject: **follow the format, give specific details, and directly hit what the question asks.**
* Never rely on just “good writing” — rely on **exam skill.**
* Ask yourself every time:
  ✦ “Did I answer what they asked?”
  ✦ “Did I explain or just describe?”
  ✦ “Did I give precise causes, names, events, years?”

Mahindra 1st gen EV woes - How I diagnosed 1-2% SoC loss parked/per day while Mahindra kept telling me it was perfectly normal + New issues,1qbnkoo,9,4,2026-01-13 10:06:57,Soggy-Law-6245,CarsIndia,"This is an ongoing service ticket at Ramani Mahindra Coimbatore. They asked me to send the videos/details mentioned here so it could be passed onto Mahindra’s central technicians. I decided to put post on this subreddit instead and send them the link. This is an excerpt from my reply(hasn't yet been sent) to an email thread with Mahindra.  
  
When I informed the CCM the accessories(including the headlights) were left disconnected but the car continued to lose charge while parked(at home) he reverted back to his previous response that it was completely normal for the car to lose 1% everyday. He claimed this had something to do with the climate conditioning of the car and its battery pack - pfa the recording of this call. I refused to accept this response as 1) I never faced soc drop when parked in the first 8 months of owning the car and 2) when the car was parked for multiple days this daily SoC dropped messed up (I think)BMS calibrations and resulted in significantly reduced city range(ODO/SoC proof already sent to Mahindra) while highway range remained the same throughout this period 3) 2 or 3 other xuv400 owners I asked did not face this issue and an SA from Chennai I asked over the phone told me as far he knew no other owners reported this problem and 4) 1% loss everyday is .4 units of electricity or \~4 to 6 rupees depending on your eb slab. Who in their right mind would purchase a car that would lose ₹4 every day it was parked if the same was communicated to them when they were purchasing the vehicle? I told the CCM I refuse to accept this response and asked him how I could escalate this above him. He asked me to respond to this email and ask for an escalation.  
I had asked 'technical leads' from 2 different SVCs if the 12v battery draining(due to its poor health or any other reason) on my EV could cause the main traction battery to lose charge everyday but was repeatedly told this couldn't be the case as if the 12v battery drained opening the car or starting it wouldn't be possible(when I looked this up online some international EVs did exhibit this behaviour). Additionally, the 12v battery underwent testing at the Coimbatore SVC and was reported to be completely fine which also led me to believe the 12v couldn't be the source of the problem. But upon coming across posts on tbhp about xuv 700s whose 12v batteries would constantly drain leaving even the doors unable to be opened [https://shorturl.at/v6NJC](https://shorturl.at/v6NJC) ,Mahindra's inability to permanently fix such relatively small issues and one of the 'technical leads'(who works primarily on ICEs, there are no dedicated technicians for EVs) openly admitting no one besides the central technical team fully understood the various systems on the EV and their functionalities - I decided to monitor the voltages/performance of the 12v battery myself before posting on tbhp asking for help with escalation. In an ideal world I would have been allowed to speak directly with the central technical team who could offer a rational explanation as to why in a sea of EVs(including those with NMC batteries) theirs alone lost charge every day it was parked but sadly this request was met with a blanket refusal every single time.  
  
I got a sensitive clamp meter online for about 4k, opened the bonnet, placed a dense weight on the bonnet sensor to simulate a locked/sleeping car, waited for an hour and consistently measured the car asleep power draw to be about 180mA which was consistent with EVs from other brands and obviously not something that justified the 400-800Wh drop in the traction battery each day. Next, I started measuring and monitoring the voltages of the 12v battery when I noticed something peculiar - every time the 12v battery hits 12.6v, the high-voltage contactor(which I learned by researching online is an electrically controlled mechanical switch that connects and disconnects the traction battery to the rest of the car - with the 400 it makes a ‘Tak’ sound every time it engages or disengages and can be heard when you turn the car on or off) would engage itself, recharge the battery with a voltage of 14.2v/initial charge current of about 1.3A and disengage itself once the battery hits 13v/charge current at 280ma(probably 180ma idle draw and 100ma going into the battery) - completely contradictory to the SVCs' claim that the 12v battery would discharge itself if the car wasn't eventually turned on. This happened without fail 2 times a day and the 1st time it happened range on the app would drop by \~3kms and the 2nd time it happened the SOC would drop by 1-2%(shockingly this also happened when the SOC was below 10% - almost all EVs stop recharging the 12v battery and let it die when the HV battery is this low). So clearly, contradictory to the CCM's claim, the 1% loss everyday had nothing to do with climate conditioning of the car/battery pack but instead had something to do with the car recharging its 12v battery. The next step to fixing this problem was to figure out the fully charged voltage of an automotive 12v lead acid battery and its depth of discharge at 12.6v. I found figures online ranging from 12.6 to 12.8v for a fully charged battery(mostly international sources though), concluded they differ based on model and hence decided to reach out to an Amaron dealer I knew and explained my predicament. In order to completely eliminate a failing battery as the reason this was happening(the international Ioniq 5’s 12v battery takes 44 hours to drop from 12.9v to 12.6v with a 200ma idle draw - [https://www.ioniqforum.com/posts/622152/](https://www.ioniqforum.com/posts/622152/)), they gave me a brand new 12v battery with the understanding that I’d purchase it if it fixed my issues. It did not. They also performed a battery test on the OEM Exide battery and found it to be working completely fine. Reached out to the technical teams of both Amaron and Exide and got the exact same response - their 12v lead acid batteries have 6 cells of 2.1v each and consequently the fully charged resting voltage of not just theirs but all 12v batteries in India is 12.6v. To further verify, I went to a nearby FNG and checked the resting voltage of the batteries of a few parked cars and found them all to be between 12.4 to 12.6, not even a just driven and parked car had above 12.65v. Exide’s regional service head later also went on to say the open circuit voltage of 12.95v mentioned on the battery’s sticker is the voltage it can sustain for extended periods when absolutely nothing is connected to it(open circuit essentially) and any meaningful load on the battery will drop the voltage to 12.6v in minutes and not hours. Based on this data from both Amaron/Exide and clear real world evidence I concluded my 400, since Nov 2023(just before the facelifted 400 was launched) - for whatever messed up reason that only Mahindra knows, was essentially recharging the 12v battery as soon as it reached its resting voltage of 12.6v. I reached out to 2 different SVCs from TN, explained that the daily soc loss was caused due to the car recharging the 12v battery before it even reached its fully charged/resting voltage(the Ioniq 5 does not need to circulate coolant to recharge its 12v battery, the 400 does - further stressing its components multiple times a day) and after 3 weeks of further drama/1 and half years of this ordeal(not even once in these 550 days was this issue not present - I have too many sad screenshots on my phone to prove that) the recharge threshold was dropped from 12.6 to 12.35v(which I verified with the car locked and parked for 5 days, a multimeter on the windshield with its wires going to the engine bay in the space between it and the bonnet) with VIN specific OTA updates. The service manager of the first SVC told me the update would have fixed it for everyone and that I didn't need to post any of this on social media for the awareness/benefit of other owners - I have these conversations recorded. After the updates the HV battery only loses 1% soc/car recharges its 12v battery once every 5 days - consistent with a 180ma draw from a 45ah battery at 40% DoD/60% SoC - the ideal DoD for maintaining lead acid battery longevity. Later(at this point it's been 6 months since the issue was fixed) I also found out leaving the car unlocked but closed for extended periods(12+ hours) would make it revert back to recharging it at 12.6v/losing 1-2% everyday and this trend would continue even after it was locked but thankfully would go back to 12.35v/normal after the car was charged back to 100% with the home charger - this info is relevant below.  
Other points of concern with the 400 - 2) A very annoying rattle on the left side of the car that I have reported in every scheduled service since the first(feel free to check service records) along with a misaligned tailgate that took excessive force to close. The tailgate misalignment has been fixed but the rattle has not. I expect a full and permanent solution to the rattle. 5) The engine bay has never been washed during scheduled services, is extremely muddy and is showing early signs of metal corrosion. Asked the service manager to please wash and clean it thoroughly this time and he says it can't be washed and can only be air blown due to electronics inside. The sticker in the bonnet just says don't wash with a high pressure washer, it does not say don't wash at all. Can Mahindra please clarify this and also clarify what it will do if the metal/plastics in the engine bay degrade/corrode? 7) The driver's side seatbelt is not retracting itself properly at times and even caused a small dent on the door frame once when I closed the door without realizing it hadn't retracted.  
The 12V Exide battery in the car was checked twice(before and after a distilled water top up) at the exclusive outlet and found to be perfectly fine both times. Supposedly, as long as batteries have caps on them which expose the electrolyte they needed a distilled water top up every 2 years despite Maintenance Free screen-printed in bold right across the battery(xD) - and of course the SVC had no idea about this. Specific gravity of the electrolyte was checked 3 days after the distilled water top-up and was found to be perfectly fine. The owner of the outlet assured me the battery was 500% okay. When I asked him what could have caused it's time to discharge by .4v(with the same 180ma load) drop by more than half he told me he's been in this industry for 18 years and has never seen a situation where one of their batteries is constantly expected to be above 12.6V. I told the service manager about this and he told me he would add the 'co-techs'(Mahindra's central technicians) on a comm call so I could explain this to them. This was on Friday but by this time I had come across issues exactly like/similar to mine on Xuv400 Facebook groups(links in the comments, I had never thought of facebook groups before running into another owner at a Dcfc station recently) I decided to create a post on this subreddit with excerpts from my 40k character email to Mahindra(it hasn't sent to them yet) which are relevant. The full email will be posted on tbhp at a later date as an open letter to Mahindra fully portraying my difficulties with the car, asking them how they’re going to compensate me and other 2023 owners that faced similar issues - and also for the potential disheartenment/disillusionment felt when owners realised they overpaid for this car by 25% due to their trust on the brand/nationalistic sentiments being exploited by Mahindra. This might be a harsh thing to say without knowing what level of margins they originally sold the 2023 car with, but at the end of the day when members of political parties that exploit nationalistic sentiments seem to be getting away with committing serious crimes on a regular basis and when families of corrupt members of political parties that exploit regional/language identities own the public roads of the country with absolutely 0 consequences, my family overpaying by 25%, having a disgusting ownership experience, and having to tolerate super cringy adverts(mocking charge point operators, Rann of Kutch with a single charge xDD) for their newer cars is not the end of the world. I expect a flawless service/warranty experience at least from now and complementary 4th and 5th year extended warranty to cement that/as a goodwill gesture.

Q Why Pakistan allied with USA in Cold War after independence?(7)

Ans:- USA was a superpower at that time with a very strong economy making it an ideal ally especially when Pakistan was a Nascent country and struggling due to unfair division of military and financial assets. Pakistan heavy economic aid and military protection against India by US. Pakistan also had the same opinion of private economy like US which made this alliance inevitable.

These ties with USA resulted in heavy aid during Afghanistan miracle war.

Secondly USSR already had good relations with India and supported it. This made Pakistan fear that if they did ally with USSR at that time they would not completely support them instead case of conflict with India unlike USA hence making USA a much better and a reliable option.

Lastly Pakistan was an Islamic republic and hence foreign policy was also constructed under the light of Islam. Islam is anti-communist and thus standing with USSR could spark public anger especially from ullemas which could create political unrest which could create political instability. Therefore USA was the best possible option as it promised internal security as well as external.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Olevels/comments/1qbn864/history_7_mark_plz_markupvote_so_more_ppl_can_mark/

"Mann Ki Baat, Yoga Day, Ram Mandir: Inside Modi govt’s media advisory playbook",1qblrop,2,1,2026-01-13 08:11:19,Sparky-moon,IndianLeft,"Government advisories to TV channels have surged under Modi and shifted from guidelines about ethics to instructions on what to cover and how.

In 2002, Narendra Modi sat across Jill McGivering from the BBC for an interview. It was shortly after the Gujarat riots, and McGivering asked Modi what he could have done differently. 
Modi’s response has become widely quoted as the biggest lesson he’s learned during his journey from chief minister to prime minister: “One area where I was very, very weak, and that was how to handle the media.”
Twenty-three years later, Modi has arguably mastered the media. And an interesting way to scrutinise what his government wants to see in the media – and what it doesn’t – is through the media advisories issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB).
Advisories are issued to all private satellite TV channels, TV service providers, cable operators, digital media platforms, FM stations and community radio stations. They aren’t legally binding – merely guidelines. 
Newslaundry examined the archive of advisories uploaded on the ministry’s website from February 2008 to November 2025. Here’s what we found.
The pre-Modi era
The first advisory to be uploaded online was in February 2008. 
Between 2008 and 2013, 20 advisories were issued, all under the tenure of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Seventeen of them were straightforward and linked to law and ethics: don’t reveal the identities of rape survivors, avoid insensitive language when reporting on disability, prohibit content that shows cruelty to animals, don’t telecast programmes that promote superstitions, occult practices, or witchcraft as factual, and don’t violate courtroom restrictions.
Two were different.
One dated October 21, 2013 criticised news channels for attempting to “denigrate the Office of the Prime Minister of India by constantly trying to compare the speech of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India with the speech of other political leaders”. The advisory said this was “highly objectionable”, “not appropriate”, and “sensational”.  
The other was issued on December 23, 2012, days after the Nirbhaya rape case in Delhi and during widespread protests against it. The advisory said private news channels had “not been showing due responsibility and maturity in telecasting the events relating [to] the said demonstration” and that such telecasts were ""likely to cause deterioration in the law & order situation”.
Then came the Modi years.
Howdy, Modi
Since Modi was sworn in on May 26, 2014, at least 130 advisories have been issued by the MIB – an average of 11-12 per year. To put that in perspective: in the entire six-year period before his tenure, starting February 2008 when the first advisory was uploaded online, only 20 advisories were issued in total.
At the outset, it’s worth noting that about 100 of these 130 advisories were much-needed, such as this one in 2022 that cautioned against airing “scandalous and unverified CCTV footage” after the Delhi riots. Or this 2017 advisory, which cautioned TV channels against airing misleading advertisements for AYUSH drugs.
Many of these advisories were procedural or rights-affirming. For example, in April 2016, the ministry urged channels to increase programming for persons with disabilities and to work towards accessibility features, such as captions for deaf and hard-of-hearing people and audio descriptions for the visually impaired. There were others on the broadcast of sign language translations during Independence Day and Republic Day coverage.
Others highlighted the need for greater national visibility for regions like the Northeast and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and for sensitive coverage of issues about race. There were also multiple advisories requiring broadcasters to stand by legal and ethical reporting norms, such as not revealing the identity of sexual assault survivors, protecting the identity of victims of child sexual abuse, including prohibiting the display of their photographs.
But what about the rest?
We identified at least 21 advisories that cluster around certain themes – themes that had no precedent earlier. These include advisories urging the promotion and broadcast of government schemes and events; advisories related to religious events and/or issues; advisories carrying political or nationalistic messaging; and advisories explicitly spelling out “what not to do”.
After May 2014, the purpose of the advisories has expanded beyond ethical and legal compliance. There has been a subtle shift — not overt censorship, but a steady expansion of the state’s editorial influence over the media houses of the country. 
Government schemes, government events 
At least 11 advisories were devoted to encouraging media houses to highlight the central government’s work. 
For example, we counted two advisories suggesting that TV channels, FM radio channels and community radio stations simultaneously broadcast Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio show. The first advisory to do so was issued in September 2014. There was also this one in January 2015 for a ‘Mann Ki Baat’ episode featuring the then US president Barack Obama.

Similar advisories encouraged the coverage of other central government campaigns too. 
In September 2014, an advisory requested the media to promote Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, pointing out that the media has a “strong social and cultural impact on society” and thus can “play an important role in building public opinion and awareness in favour of the ‘Swatchh Bharat Abhiyan’”. Another advisory in September 2017 flagged the government’s Swachhta Hi Sewa campaign and requested the media to give “adequate attention” to the campaign in their programming.
And the media’s coverage? News packages included quotes from celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar and Sachin Tendulkar endorsing the campaign while anchors said their participation was proof of success. 

Missing from these ‘debates’ was any criticism – which you can read about here, here and here – of the campaign. 
Appealing to the significance of International Yoga Day for India, “particularly when the genesis of practice of Yoga is associated with our country and several initiatives have been taken by institutions, both public and private, to promote the cause,” the ministry issued advisories on the event’s media coverage on at least two occasions.
While recognising the immense contribution of all private TV channels and FM stations to the “cause of promotion of Yoga and International Day of Yoga in the past”, an advisory was released on June 7, 2016. It also mentioned that the ministry “hoped that they [private TV and FM stations] will take all possible steps this year also to promote International Yoga Day (IYD)”. The method of promotion was also specified — “by carrying special features or in any other befitting manner during the period leading to the occasion”.
In June 2020, another advisory encouraged media channels to cover the IYD event and broadcast the remarks of the Prime Minister on the same. 

When the government launched 'Mission Indradhanush' with the aim of expanding immunisation coverage to all children across India, the ministry reached out to the electronic media through an advisory in 2017: 
“Electronic Media has always been in the forefront to carry such message as it is a powerful tool to reach out to the people across the country. In order to make this mission a success, it has been felt that support, assistance and contribution of private TV channels and FM radio channels will be of immense use.” 
All private satellite TV/FM radio channels and their associations were “requested to give adequate publicity to 'Mission lndradhanush' in a befitting manner, pro bono, as part of their CSR activities”. 
Similarly in the year 2018 and 2019, MIB again ‘requested’ all private satellite TV/FM radio channels and their associations to give publicity to “Mission Indradhanush” as a part of their CSR activities. 
It is noteworthy how a government ministry directed private media houses on how to deploy their CSR activities – an intervention that had no precedent before.
When the GST Cell was organising the GST awareness campaign 'Manthan', across the country, MIB, on July 27, 2017, requested private TV channels to run scrolls on the issue in order to publicise the campaign. It added, “all TV channels and their associations viz. News Broadcasters Association and Indian Broadcasting Foundation, are requested to run the scrolls, on a pro bono basis.”
Even the messages to be scrolled were narrated in the MIB advisories. 
Advisories also regularly popped up whenever the government had a big event or commemoration planned. 
On October 31, 2025, for example, the Modi government celebrated Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s 150th birth anniversary, dubbed Rashtriya Ekta Diwas. A day before, the MIB’s advisory detailed the schedule of events. (Similar advisories had been issued in 2017 and 2018.)
Unsurprisingly, we saw wall-to-wall coverage on news channels the next day. News18, Aaj Tak, Times Now, NDTV, Zee News, ABP Live and India TV locked on the live feed of the parade, the PM’s arrival, floral tributes, and more. Tickers had the same phrases on loop like this one: “Sardar Patel ki jayanti par bhavya karyakram” on Aaj Tak.

Similarly, on July 25, 2019, a day before the 20th anniversary of the Kargil war, the MIB issued an advisory detailing the government’s activities. It also requested private news channels to “screen Documentary on Kargil War & Kargil Tribute song and to telecast and cover events relating to celebration of Kargil Vijay Diwas” to spread the message of “nationalism and patriotism” to the “farthest corner of the nation.” 
They obliged. 

Ayodhya extravaganza, selective censorship
As per the archives of MIB advisories, June 20, 2014 was the first instance when the ministry issued an advisory related to a religious event. The document titled ‘Office Memorandum’ appealed to all private TV channels to “broadcast public interest messages with regard to Shri Amarnathji Yatra - 2014.” 
These public interest messages included registration of yatris of Shri Amamathji Yatra, Dos and Don'ts, health advisory provided by Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board. Some channels, however, went a step further. ABP News travelled to the Amarnath cave itself, branding the coverage as “Chalo Amarnath” and Aaj Tak leaned into a devotional pitch — “Baba ne bulaya hai.”
When the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya took place in 2024, Big Media was distinctively saffron. Two days before the event, MIB had issued an advisory urging the media to be cautious of content that has the potential to disturb communal harmony. 
Yet much of the coverage on news channels was openly provocative and hyper-nationalistic: 

In the wake of the Supreme Court judgement on the Ayodhya title dispute, the ministry issued an advisory asking electronic media to ensure that debates/discussions/ visuals carried on their platforms “do not incite any divisive or anti-national feelings or sentiments”. 
Before 2014, the ministry had never issued advisories relating to religious matters, religious events, or court decisions of this nature.
Finally, we counted at least three advisories that we classified as ‘what not to do’. 
In May last year, days after the Pahalgam terror attack, the MIB issued an advisory urging OTT and media streaming platforms to “discontinue the web-series, films, songs, podcasts and other streaming media content…having its origins in Pakistan”. This was in the “interest of national security”. 
In 2023, when India and Canada were at loggerheads, ABP invited separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu for a debate. The ministry promptly issued an advisory saying Pannu was accused of “serious cases of crime including terrorism” and that he had made comments that were “detrimental” to India’s sovereignty and security on the channel. It urged news channels to refrain from platforming such individuals. 
However, multiple times Hindutva leaders and rabble rousers who have been accused of hate-speech and serious crimes have been called to TV channels for discussions with anchors, but the ministry has always failed to take note of it. 
Pointing to the coverage on North-East Delhi Riots, the ministry, rightfully, expressed serious concerns on the coverage by the TV channels which contained “provocative headlines and videos of violence that may incite communal hatred,” “scandalous and unverified CCTV footages” that could disrupt the ongoing investigation. 
However, when unverified information claiming Umar Khalid’s involvement in Delhi Riots was broadcasted, the ministry failed to flag it as objectionable. Also, other provocative and unverified coverage was not called out by the ministry.
The advisory dated Sept 21, 2023, also pointed out to the TV channels running “footage of a specific community thus aggravating the communal tensions.” As an example, it highlighted that “a channel repeatedly carried a video clipping of a man belonging to a specific community carrying a sword”. However, it again failed to act when almost every TV channel was flashing the news of Shahrukh Pathan pointing a gun during the North East Delhi Riots — TikTok Star बना दंगा Star जानिए शाहरुख़ का पूरा सच.

When asked about the changing nature of these advisories under Modi, senior journalist Jyotsna Mohan said, “Earlier, there were clear boundaries between the media and the government. Today, those lines no longer exist. Advisories function like internal notes or memos from the bosses and, barring notable exceptions, legacy media readily complies. And advisories are one side of the coin. We have also seen how the government choreographs media content unofficially using civil servants, in ways that are unconstitutional.”
Newslaundry sent questionnaires to representatives from the MIB: union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, minister of state L Murugan, secretary Sanjay Jaju, and director (broadcasting and finance) Gopal Aditya Raghuvanshi. This report will be updated once they respond.

IIM INDORE Interview Transcript(Not mine),1qbhim5,1,0,2026-01-13 04:14:09,AmitPantik,CATiim,"
Two panelists, male (P1) and female (P2)

P1: so miss (lastname), introduce yourself

I introduced my academic background while relating it with the many cities and 2 countries I've lived in.

P1: so why did you apply for the HRM, and not the general MBA?

I answered properly on why it suits my journey more given my experiences and qualities (the truth is I had assumed that i didn't get shortlisted for general MBA but I found out now that I had accidently unclicked the regular pgp option in the CAT form. Biggest fumble of my life)

P1: so you're from lucknow

Me: Yes sir, but I've only lived here about 6yrs and not explored much.

P1: okay then make an itinerary for someone who's coming for two days

Me: can I have more specifics on their background?

P1: yes, the tourists are foreigners and they've never been to India.

I answered beginning with bhool bhulaiya, historical but guided so also ensures their safety. Then a guided food walk in the old city, ending with a walk in the Janeshwar Mishra Park. ( I forgot the exact points I gave for each justification but he was satisfied with the answer)

P2: so you studied psychology? Then tell me about xyz (some concept I'd never heard about)

Me: sorry, it wasn't in our course (psych was my minor)

P2: okay then tell me about psychoanalysis

Told her, including about Freud, etc. She followed up with the three parts of ""brain"" acc to him, I answered with the 3 subconscious - I'd, ego, superego. Admitted that I might be mixing up eg and superego but rest I was sure of. Gave a detailed example of the working of the three. She kept asking me if I was sure about ego and superego, I told her I'm mostly sure but I could be correct since it had been over 3 yrs.

Then she asked me if Freud was a psychoanalyst, I said yes, she said are you sure multiple times and I kept saying yes. She ended with you're wrong and handed over the questions to P1.

P1: so you have been appointed as the Prime minister's counsel for one day and you have to raise 5 issues which need his immediate attention. Please list them.

The 5 points I listed were - better education for the poorest of the poor with better career guidance (tied this with my 5mo xp at an education consultancy), diversifying tourism points, minimising the wealth gap that has increasingly widened since Covid19, and also transparency in the policies of the government since India is home to the largest youth population and transparency will help them make wise decisions.

For the 5th point, I asked if I could mention smth that might not need immediate attention but will boost economy, he said yes, so I said investment in the esports sector as well as measure to curb its addiction. He seemed satisfied with the answer and had no follow ups.

Then he asked me to give 5 points of attention for the opposition. I said that the points would remain the same since if they worked for the betterment of the country people are bound to notice and vote for them.

He insisted and said that I need to advise Rahul gandhi with these 5 points. I asked if whether from a solely winning perspective or betterment of country, he said solely winning.

I mainly modified the points I had given for the PM. Example - by focusing on diversifying tourism he will be able to get attention of the diverse voting population, while usually the attention is focused on the hindi speaking belt. Instead of esports I said that he could focus on the flaws of the ruling party, like farmers protest, while emphasising the ethics.

He seemed satisfied with the answers and no follow ups were asked by either. They told me I was done and asked me to pick up a toffee, i did.

The entire interview lasted about 15 mins and although it was the average length I was slightly disappointed and felt it was short and I could've elaborated more at places (although they sometimes cut me off to ask next questions)",https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1qbhim5/iim_indore_interview_transcriptnot_mine/
Find something to judge me for - 61 options: part 2,1qbh4oc,1,0,2026-01-13 03:55:44,hymnsomnia,u_hymnsomnia,"Gun control - I don’t support it. California has more gun control laws than a lot of other states but a higher homicide rate. It’s insane that the government has killed US citizens over private firearms that were not used to commit crimes.


Immigration - This is where most people would have a problem with me. So, I’ll devote more words to it. As a kid, I never thought about immigration at all. But, after immigration changed the face of my neighborhood (and the cities around it), I started to feel a sense of cultural alienation and reconsidered the issue more in-depth. This led me to where I am now. First of all, I don’t support illegal immigration, sanctuary cities, or “abolish ICE” narratives; I think that nations need to have borders (no borders = no nation). We cannot afford to house the entire Third World in the US/Europe; we do not have the space or resources to do this and it’s not our job either. So, the deportation of illegal immigrants (esp. criminals) does not concern me much; these people broke the law. As for legal immigration, I don’t think I would mind it that much if it occurred at reasonable levels, but I think the current amount of immigration in most Western countries is too high and has become problematic. Karl Marx was critical of mass immigration, and it was one of the few things that he was right about; he understood that the Elites bring in the immigrants to enrich themselves and increase their profits at the expense of the average citizen. And this is true: Mass immigration is architected by Western Elites/billionaires/corporations and is almost entirely financially motivated - it’s not about “helping” these people at all. In fact, narratives about “helping” immigrants, creating a diverse and equitable society, upholding “social justice,” and “fighting xenophobia” *are weaponized by the Elites* to convince people that the mass immigration is good for them - or even a moral obligation that we are required to support - instead of a vulture capitalist tactic to exploit foreign labor and suppress wage growth. It’s very, very, very convenient for the Elites that they can call you “racist” if you question the current level of immigration; similarly, the Elites have capitalized on Critical Race Theory, social justice and antiracist narratives to turn well-meaning progressives into rabid defenders of their economic initiatives (this is ironic since progressives *should in theory* oppose these billionaires’ efforts to lower our wages via artificially induced population growth… but they get the progressives to perceive it as a 100% moral issue about racism and equality to prevent them from understanding the economic motives behind it and its economic impacts on the average citizen). I will state it 100 times: Mass immigration is being orchestrated by Elites/billionaires/corporations, is almost entirely financially motivated, is intended to provide (oftentimes cheap) foreign labor, is intended to lower wages/prevent wage growth, is intended to undermine workers' unions (since diverse workforces are less likely to unionize), and benefits the Elites but not the average person. Mass immigration makes housing crises worse, makes cost of living crises worse, and sometimes boosts the GDP while the quality of life and standard of living of each individual within the nation declines (side note: in some cases it has been associated with a decline in real GDP - but Elites still wanted to exploit it). Elites love H1B visas because H1B workers can be paid literal scraps but can’t demand better conditions. The entire goal is to artificially increase the size of the population… That’s it. But when did Americans have better lives - when the population was 250 million or now (335 million)? When were houses more affordable? When could American families survive on one income? Mass immigration is one of several factors that caused these economic shifts. In that sense, progressives who claim to be anti-capitalist fail to see how mass immigration is, in fact, a vulture capitalist exploit that is not about “helping” people or improving society but about fulfilling specific Elite economic goals. Even Jeff Bezos made his Amazon workforce as diverse as possible, filling it with people from completely different cultures who spoke different languages, in an attempt to prevent successful unionization. Even illegal immigrants are exploited and paid literal scraps - progressives don’t see an issue with this for some reason. But what about the effects of excessive immigration (and the resultant multiculturalism) on social welfare? Which is stronger, more stable, and more unified - a multicultural society or a homogenous society? When I first started to investigate this question, I discovered Robert Putnam, author of “Bowling Alone,” and his research on diversity and multiculturalism and social cohesion and social trust. His results shocked him: In the most diverse and multicultural communities, residents trusted each other half as much as they did in the most homogenous communities. Furthermore, residents of diverse and multicultural communities had lower civic participation, volunteered less, and were less involved in their communities. As I continued to investigate this issue, I found a bunch of other studies on the effect of diversity and multiculturalism on social cohesion and social trust, and bookmarked them as I went; all derived similar conclusions (social trust and social cohesion went down). But it’s not difficult to understand why: basic logic would lead you to the conclusion that multicultural societies are more likely to become fragmented, disunited, polarized, or mired in internal conflicts between groups than monocultural ones. Just look at Latin America, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, the Balkans, etc… Internal conflict has been a constant force in these countries because their populations are split into different cultural and religious factions. Compare this to a more unified country like China or Japan and the difference becomes clear - multiculturalism is actually a “weakening” force in society and is thus a risk factor for authoritarianism (dictators can use the internal conflict to justify authoritarian policies and expansion of government power… the UK is now headed down this path as the government uses so-called anti-immigration riots to crack down on free speech and online freedom). I even found research showing that multiculturalism lowers the birth rates of the original/indigenous population (perhaps due to economic impacts and alienation). I am open to arguments about the benefits of multiculturalism but I’d need to encounter a powerful counterargument to “cancel out” the research I’ve seen - it also seems that modern governments have to “force” multiculturalism to “work” via the creation of new laws and national narratives. In the US, the GDP is fine, crime remains unaffected in most cases, and a lot of immigrants are productive; however, the economic and social impacts remain but are seldom mentioned… even as the population balloons in size. In Europe, mass immigration is a lot more of a problem than it is in the US, and there are several reasons for this. First of all, European countries receive worse quality immigrants than the US due to the influx of refugees and lack of selection, so some immigrant groups in Europe cost thousands of Euros over the course of their lifetimes and are a net negative on the economy - this outcome was perhaps not anticipated by the people who decided to open the borders. Second of all, some immigrants in European countries have increased crime, unlike what we see in the US. Third of all, Islam has now started to spread in parts of Europe that were never Islamic, and this should be of concern to those who value a free and liberal society. Fourth of all, mass immigration in Europe is immoral (in my opinion) - I will explain this perspective here. Europe is not like the US: the people who live there are the indigenous people of the continent. So, in the case of Europe, mass immigration (which is occurring at demographic replacement levels) can be seen as state-sanctioned ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population; it can also be seen as forced assimilation and forced population transfer (these are supposed to be considered crimes against humanity) since the population never consented to the ethnic replacement and in fact opposes it (the majority opinion in these countries is that the current amount of immigration is too high - that’s the ONLY reason for the “rise of the far-right” there… these people do not want a fascist government at all, they just want less immigration and want to be able to keep their own countries). So, in Europe, mass immigration is an unpopular “forced demographic change experiment” that is not the result of democratic processes; it is an anti-democratic phenomenon that was forced on the population. Open borders has hurt Western Europe a lot and the effects are clear to see. But in order to understand how serious this is, we need to consider the long-term effects of it; not just what we can observe right now. The truth is, if the mass immigration in Europe continues, it will have the same long-term impact as colonialism: the erasure of the original group(s) and cultures. The first long-term impact is that the 80 ethnicities native to the continent will cease to exist at some point (lower birth rates doesn’t help with this). Then, because it is impossible to 100% perfectly maintain a civilization or culture as is in the face of total demographic change, the cultural landscape will also be transformed and the continent will lose its heritage. Based on current data, British people, Swedes, French people, Belgians, and Germans are projected to become ethnic minorities in their own countries around 2060 or so; later these groups will cease to exist altogether. It is extremely difficult for me to support this no matter how hard people try to convince me; to me it is an unforgivable crime and never should have happened. I think each native group should get their own country, and get to keep their country, to prevent the destruction of cultural diversity. If globalism is allowed to continue, and spreads to every part of the world, diversity will eventually cease to exist. Is this not a bad thing? Why do progressives want a Palestinian state but can’t accept the concept of an Irish state? Why do some groups have a right to their land while others don’t? What if both Palestinians and Irish people have the same right to their land (and survival as a people)? Are Europeans in Europe not considered indigenous to the continent just because they are “white?” This is my ultimate conflict with some people on the political left: The hypocrisy and racial double standards. But I am not motivated by “hatred” as they might claim. I’m motivated by empirical observations, a basic understanding of cause and effect, a desire to protect countries that I value, a consistent set of “rules” that are not dependent on skin color, and moral concerns, and because of this I do not believe that the Elites behind the current levels of immigration have good motives. I implore my opponents to explain why diversity should be destroyed via globalism and why Elites should be allowed to orchestrate forced population transfer on one specific continent but not others. In conclusion: I didn’t think about immigration before, but now I think that it has become excessive and gotten out of control. I perceive the current level of immigration in Western Europe as genocidal in nature because it is predicted to erase the native ethnic groups.


Israel - I don’t like Israel at all and reject the narrative that Israel is our “greatest ally.” Israel exploits the US for $$$ and weapons (the Israelis use their extensive lobbying groups such as AIPAC to get what they want at all times), exercises disproportionate control over the US government and US foreign policy, controls Congress (via AIPAC), engages in blatant election interference, is a constant source of conflict in the Middle East, expects us to fight all of their wars for them, drags us into new wars/conflicts all the time, tries to steal land and causes chaos, has killed US citizens, has plotted terrorist attacks against the US and UK, carries out more political assassinations than any other modern nation, spies on the US, steals our military technology, had 200 spies in the US in September 2001, blackmailed US politicians (even Obama said he sometimes feared for his life because of them), commits insane war crimes and atrocities, the list goes on. Israel is even the reason for the war in Iraq: It was American Zionists connected to Israel who created the false intelligence that was used to justify the war (false claims that Saddam Hussein had nukes etc). Israel is a leech that is sucking us dry and we shouldn’t be sending them 10 million USD in aid every 24 hours. Aid to Israel is out of control and we should not be fighting Israel’s wars 24/7. Israel even bombed our servicemen and covered it up afterward; it’s the worst “ally” the world has ever seen and the supremacist attitudes of Israeli politicians are vile. But, it is their true belief that the Palestinians or “goyim” are “human animals” etc. The book “The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy” is an excellent criticism of the Israel Lobby and Israel’s negative impact on the United States. However, those interested in Israel’s crimes can also research the Lavon Affair, the Apollo Affair, the USS Liberty Incident, Mordechai Vanunu, Folke Bernadotte, Rachel Corrie, the Sabra and Shatila Massacre, the Deir Yassin Massacre, Israel’s spying on the White House, Israel’s spying on Boris Johnson, Israel’s various assassinations, the King David Hotel Bombing, Israeli terrorist groups e.g. Lehi and Irgun, the Samson Option, Israeli foreknowledge of October 7, Israeli support for Hamas, Israeli support for cartels/the Azov Battalion, Jeffrey Epstein’s ties to Israel, and other such horrors - some I won’t mention here. Israeli organizations also traffic refugees generated by US-Israeli wars to Europe. The core problem is how Israel behaves on the international stage and exploits the US.


Russia - The West/NATO has provoked Russia for 20 years and it needs to stop. The West/NATO caused the war in Ukraine by staging a coup there and installing Zelenskyy; John Mearsheimer has the best lecture on this and it can be found on YouTube. Russia is far from perfect, obviously, but Western Elites have bad motives in interfering with it and trying to undermine the country at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.


China - The CCP sucks - no doubt. But, China is a powerful country and economy that can hardly be called “Third World” or even “Second World;” the Chinese are very smart and will usurp us if we’re not careful. In some regards, the Chinese are making far better political decisions than us, and I respect them for fighting to preserve their culture while also increasing their participation in the global economy. Overall, the country is unfairly vilified, even though it is a threat to American preeminence and threatens the emergence of a multipolar world order. Unlike Western European countries, China refuses to sacrifice their national identity, and I respect them a lot for this. Various Chinese governments did do bad things to the Tibetans and other groups which should be acknowledged - and their role in the fentanyl crisis is significant. Still, even though covid appeared to have come from a Chinese lab, all of that gain of function research was funded by Americans and the NIH (American). 


Foreign aid to Israel - It’s bad, stop it


Foreign aid to Ukraine - It’s excessive, cut it


American imperialism - It’s bad. I prefer isolationism and anti-interventionism. The US should not be invading other countries and/or getting involved in foreign wars 24/7. On the international stage, the US is often the bad guy, and our various regime change efforts in foreign countries had horrific results; in the end, none of this was justifiable or even good for our country. Why can’t US politicians work on solving domestic problems instead of meddling in other countries?


The War on Terror - I hate it. I don’t support the War on Terror, the Patriot Act, or the Project for a New American Century (PNAC). All of it benefits Israel and harms the US. It cost 5 million lives and almost 8 trillion. It was never about “fighting terrorism” or “protecting Americans;” it was about re-shaping the Middle East to Israel’s liking and taking advantage of the natural resources there.


The War on Drugs - It’s dumb and pointless. Jailing people who suffer from substance abuse disorders is cruel. Go after the dealers and manufacturers; not the victims. Focus on fighting international drug trafficking instead of putting veterans with PTSD behind bars over some pills.


Weed - Just legalize it. Who cares


Feminism - Feminism has gone too far. Liberal feminism, which is the dominant form of feminism in 2026, is not even “feminist” at all in my opinion; in fact it harms women by selling the lie(s) that OnlyFans is “empowering,” prostitution (which it calls “sex work”) is “empowering,” sex with 100 men is “empowering,” making the word “woman” impossible to define is beneficial to women, and deeming all female-only spaces (even rape shelters) “transphobic.” Liberal feminism is too critical of men and blames “straight white males” for all problems (where’s the gratitude???). Liberal feminists often criticize and chastise women who are more modest or embrace family values (I thought it was about choice??? Guess not). Liberal feminists want to keep some aspects of “patriarchy” (like men paying for all their shit) but not others. It’s just a toxic ideology all around. Radical feminism is not as bad, since it isn’t pro-prostitution or opposed to women’s actual interests to the same extent, but its promotion of hatred towards men also makes it toxic.  


Prostitution - It’s bad and it should be banned. Legalizing it doesn’t help shit. It hurts people either way and most prostitutes are victims of horrific violence, mental illness, poverty, etc.; the whole thing is just exploitative and impossible to justify


Obscenity laws - Bring them back!!! I’m tired of seeing porn everywhere.


The hypersexualization of society - It’s bad, simple as. 


Trump Derangement Syndrome - It’s real. But not everyone who criticizes Trump suffers from it. The people who think Trump is identical to Hitler do suffer from it, though. Trump is a neoconservative at his core, which means that he is a neoliberal at his core, and much of what he does is just talk (albeit narcissistic and stupid/inflammatory talk); he’s basically just a lukewarm moderate with a big mouth and no decorum at all. Joe Biden made far more extreme racist comments if you look into it - Trump never said anything that bad as far as I’m aware. Trump is, for the most part, just a slimy rich person with a massive ego and some moral deficiencies. More criticisms of him below. (I reject almost all progressive criticisms of Trump)


Donald Trump - I am critical of Trump - but for different reasons than most people. First, I feel that Trump is a bit narcissistic, likes to stir up trouble, has a massive ego, makes ridiculous and inflammatory statements, and lacks decorum. Second, Trump advocates a lot of ridiculous and pointless things that no one ever asked for (such as taking over Greenland, bombings in multiple different countries - yes Obama and Biden were also guilty of this, or “Trump Gaza”). Third, Trump sucks up to Netanyahu and Israel 24/7 and does whatever the Israelis want, which is pathetic and hard to watch (it is at least in part because he was bribed with over 200 million). Fourth, Trump bombed Iran on Israel’s behalf, which I opposed; he also bombed other countries which I opposed. Fifth, Trump was friends with Epstein and their relationship is suspect. Sixth, Trump has increased government spending, not decreased it. Seventh, Trump shows favoritism towards specific corporations and bails them out. Eighth, Trump lies a lot and makes constant efforts to distract us from his failures. Ninth, Trump is haphazard with his tariffs. Tenth, Trump can be quite chaotic and disorganized. Trump has a lot of the same flaws as Clinton, Obama, or Biden (beholden to special interest groups; no real change). Trump has even deported fewer people than Obama (ironic since people think the opposite). Still, I think that Kamala is worse than Trump.


Joe Biden - He was too senile to be president and didn’t achieve much.


Kamala Harris - She is very unintelligent and had no real platform. She’s also super cringy. Listening to her talk is hard for me and I felt pleased when she lost and I got to watch all the progressives have a breakdown while I was fine because I didn’t have the delusion that Trump is “Hitler”


JD Vance - I don’t like him due to his ties to Peter Thiel and Palantir. He also has no character or charisma. I’m not convinced he even knows what he believes - he has been pro-Trump and anti-Trump, for example. He’s the ultimate Elite-manufactured neoliberal bureaucrat whose purpose is to serve the same Elite that gave us the war in Iraq and the expanded surveillance state. I also don’t trust him not to expand H1B since he is associated with the tech bros who exploit it. Sometimes, he seems to want to move in a different direction, but he does whatever Trump wants afterward. It’s difficult to place or define him because he is so inconsistent. I also think he’s cringy.


Tim Walz - He has about as much testosterone as a rock. He was awful during covid, awful in how he handled the George Floyd riots, was too soft on crime, and wanted to increase state spending. He just didn’t have much to offer.


Vivek Ramaswamy - He’s on here because I hate him - and that’s about it. He never has a decent idea. His flavor of civic nationalism makes no sense. He seems to prioritize the advancement of his own ethnic group over all others. He called white Americans “lazy” during his freakout even though white Americans were the ones who built the nation. I wish he would just sit down.


Zohran Mamdani - I almost forgot to include him. I think he’s naive, performative, and manipulative; he also has no idea what it means to be an American since he just got here. His anti-Western perspective is excessive even though I do agree with him about Israel (I think that’s about it?). Some of his prescribed “socialist” policies were super ridiculous but he’ll never institute them; he just wanted the votes. The fact that it’s become so “trendy” to support him is a reason for skepticism. He has no experience either; he’s more of an activist than a serious politician. I also hated his position on crime and law enforcement. Yeah, let’s release more career criminals into NYC!


Bernie Sanders - He’s better than Biden, Kamala, Mamdani, etc. but he waited until the last moment to criticise Israel amidst the recent war. I also expressed skepticism about the “democratic socialism” concept that he promotes. His proposed policies would have required massive tax hikes and the government already uses our tax dollars wastefully and irresponsibly; it’s hard to support government spending when the funds are not being used efficiently (much of the time the funds aren’t even used to improve our lives). A lot of his policies could have backfired and hurt certain economic sectors - it’s similar to how excessive regulations in California have led to capital flight.


Barack Obama - Most overrated president. His actions in the Middle East were indefensible (same with the Clintons). I read part of his book and it was lame. His healthcare reforms kind of failed. Never forget his drone strikes, actions in Libya, actions in Syria, and surveillance of American citizens. His rhetoric on race was also unhelpful; if you want to maintain a diverse society, inflaming racial tensions is the worst thing you can do since those tensions are already simmering beneath the surface. 


Critical Race Theory - I reject it because I believe that its core assumptions are false. It’s also harmful in that it promotes racial polarization and anti-white narratives that are themselves racist in nature. Above all, while it attempts to explain what we see, it fails to do so; the “explanations” it presents are weak and untenable. Research shows that exposure to Critical Race Theory makes people more aggressive, more paranoid, and more authoritarian in the workplace. It can be debunked in minutes due to its weaknesses - the Occam’s razor alternative cannot.


Islamic terrorism - It’s a real problem and it became a problem in Europe when the borders were opened. But, the threat of Islamic terrorism is exaggerated and overstated by pro-Israel, Zionist, and neoconservative groups; this is their attempt to convince us that their constant Middle East wars, invasions, bombings, and regime change operations are necessary or justified. It’s like how Israel claimed Palestinian kids were terrorists. It’s even more ridiculous when you consider how many Islamic terrorist groups have been funded, aided, or armed by the CIA, MI6 and Mossad. For example, see Hillary Clinton’s famous email: “Al-Qaeda is on our side in Syria” (exposed by WikiLeaks). Now, an offshoot of Al-Qaeda is in charge of Syria because Turkey and NATO countries worked to orchestrate the fall of the Assad regime. Since the Assad regime fell, these terrorists have massacred minorities across the country. But Western leaders, Israel and neoconservatives supported this transition of power. Despite this perspective, I do believe that progressives tend to ignore the real-world repercussions of Islamic terrorism, such as the Yezidi genocide. Alas, progressives ignore most atrocities committed by groups they deem “marginalized.”


Far-right extremism - The government wants us to believe that it’s the “biggest domestic terror threat.” However, far-right extremist groups are rare and don’t seem to do much; in addition, a lot of the people who are called “far-right” are not extremist at all. That’s because the term “far-right” is now used to smear anyone who doesn’t agree with progressive narratives - even if they aren’t “hateful” at all. Neo Nazis do exist but their numbers are small and Antifa and anarchist-related agitation seems to be a lot more common. It’s hard for me to comment on far-right extremism when millions of normal people are now considered far-right extremist just because they questioned SRS for minors, mass immigration or Critical Race Theory.


Far-left extremism - It exists in places like Portland, OR, Minneapolis, etc. It’s often anarchist or Antifa-adjacent. Sometimes, it is also anti-Western or communist; I don’t agree with it but find it a bit hilarious. These are the people who start riots, block off streets, attempt to create autonomous zones, damage people’s private property to “protest climate change,” and are the loudest agitators in our cities. I am sometimes concerned for their welfare since some of them like to interfere with law enforcement and put themselves in bad situations. 


George Floyd - I think that Derek Chauvin didn’t need to hold him down like that. But, I’m skeptical of the narrative surrounding the incident because of the body cam footage and the original autopsy report. In the body cam footage, you can clearly see that he started saying “I can’t breathe” long before he was ever on the ground; in fact he first says it when he’s sitting in the car. The original autopsy report did not find damage to his trachea or conclude that he died of asphyxiation (the family paid for a second autopsy). Whatever happened, Derek Chauvin did not receive a fair trial due to the media frenzy surrounding the incident/the immense pressure that was put on the prosecutors, judge and jurors, and the 2020 riots that succeeded the incident caused billions in damage and were horrific to witness - the behavior of these rioters was impossible for me to support.


H1B visas and race-based subsidies - I don’t support H1B; at the least, applications should be reduced. Most H1B visa holders are from India. It does displace Americans from jobs - and the visa holders are paid scraps. Likewise, the government offers subsidies to some people based on race (for example, Indians can receive subsidies to start certain businesses), and I don’t think it’s fair.


Military spending - It’s too high


Homelessness - I don’t know how to solve it, but Gavin Newsom’s attempts made it worse. I suppose that tells us what not to do


Climate change - I believe it does exist but would like to see more research on it. Non-Western countries don’t seem as excited to reduce their emissions which doesn’t help much.


Anti-Americanism - The US is awful around the world - as I explained under “American imperialism.” But I reject the “America is an evil, white supremacist, colonialist project” discourse that comes from progressive groups - it’s myopic and childish. 


Taxes - We need to have them but taxes are excessive in a lot of states; California is one example. To make matters worse, the taxes aren’t used to benefit us. Tax cuts should be provided to the middle class instead of the top 0.0001%. A lot of taxes should be abolished if state governments can’t allocate the funds efficiently.


Public schools - Most of them kinda suck due to politics in the classroom. But American schools are not as bad as people claim; split the data by demographics or socioeconomic status and this becomes clear. The “worst” schools are in low socioeconomic status areas and increasing funding for these schools rarely helps. That’s because the brainpower of the students matters; 90 IQ hillbillies will never perform as well as students from middle class families.


Healthcare - It’s too expensive but the Canadian system is no better. We need a third path


Affirmative action and DEI - I don’t support it. It’s just another form of discrimination and will not “fix” recalcitrant disparities that exist worldwide and are impervious to remediation efforts 


ACAB - It’s dumb. I don’t like the police, and a lot of police are bad, but you can’t have a functional society without some kind of law enforcement

Who Faces Maximum Risk to Trump's 25% Iran Tariff?,1qbguik,1,0,2026-01-13 03:42:23,MarketFlux,MarketFluxHub,"President Trump announced immediate 25% tariffs on any nation conducting business with Iran, dramatically expanding U.S. economic pressure beyond Tehran to encompass its entire trading network. This unprecedented secondary sanctions framework threatens to disrupt $70+ billion in annual trade flows and could push effective U.S.-China tariff rates above 45%, reigniting trade war volatility while exposing critical vulnerabilities across energy, manufacturing, and emerging market sectors.

The tariff order, declared ""final and conclusive"" via Truth Social on January 12, 2026, provides no implementation timeline, compliance thresholds, or enforcement mechanisms. This ambiguity creates immediate uncertainty for major economies including China (Iran's largest trading partner at roughly $53 billion annually), India ($8+ billion), UAE ($21 billion in bilateral flows), and Turkey ($13 billion). The policy coincides with escalating Iranian protests and follows Trump's threat of military action if demonstrators are killed positioning tariffs as both economic weapon and geopolitical lever.

**Exposure Analysis: Who Faces Maximum Risk**

**1. China: The Primary Target**

China dominates Iran's economic lifeline, purchasing approximately 90% of Iranian oil exports averaging 1.37 million barrels per day in 2025 worth roughly $46.7 billion annually. This represents 13.5% of China's total crude imports and finances an estimated 45% of Iran's government budget. The 25% Iran tariff would compound existing U.S.-China duties (currently 20% base plus 10% reciprocal), potentially driving the total effective rate to 45%+ more than doubling the 20% truce level negotiated after 2025's trade war that briefly hit 145%. Chinese independent ""teapot"" refineries in Shandong Province, which process discounted Iranian crude through elaborate ship-to-ship transfers and falsified origin documents, face existential pressure.

**2. India**

India imported $2.7 billion from Iran in 2025 (8% of Iran's import market) and maintains strategic energy ties despite previous U.S. pressure. New Delhi already faces 50% minimum tariffs on goods since Trump's 2025 punishment for Russian oil purchases. Additional Iran-related duties would compound costs across pharmaceuticals, machinery, and agricultural exports sectors where India competes globally.

**3. UAE**

The UAE serves as Iran's second-largest trading partner ($21 billion combined flows), functioning as the primary re-export hub for both Iranian goods seeking global markets and foreign products entering Iran. Dubai's role as financial intermediary and logistics gateway means tariffs could fracture critical Middle East trade infrastructure, with spillover effects on regional stability.

**4. Turkey**

Turkey conducts $13 billion in bilateral trade with Iran, including natural gas imports that surged to critical levels before July 2025 cutbacks. Facing NATO alliance pressures and economic fragility (47% inflation), Ankara must choose between energy security and U.S. market access its $32 billion annual export destination.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketFluxHub/comments/1qbguik/who_faces_maximum_risk_to_trumps_25_iran_tariff/

“It seems revenge will be taken for the New Delhi Red Fort blast.And recent drone attacks.”,1qbs7z7,1,0,2026-01-13 14:07:16,Large-Lavishness-362,NewDelhi,"“Operation Sindoor remains ongoing and any misadventure by the adversary will be dealt with effectively,” Army Chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi said on Tuesday (January 13, 2026), sending a firm message to Pakistan.  
  
The Army chief, addressing a press conference, said the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China has been stable, but it needs constant vigil.  
  
Extensively elaborating on various aspects of Operation Sindoor, Gen. Dwivedi said it helped in resetting the strategic assumptions as the Indian military struck deep to dismantle terror infrastructure and puncturing Islamabad’s “longstanding nuclear rhetoric”.  
  
“As you may be aware, Operation Sindoor remains ongoing, and a future misadventure will be resolutely responded to,” he said.  
  
Gen. Dwivedi said the Operation was India’s calibrated and resolute response to cross-border terrorism, demonstrating readiness, precision, and strategic clarity.”  
  
He also said the Indian Army had mobilised its troops and was ready for ground offensives.  
  
“The situation along the northern front remains stable, but needs constant vigil. Renewed contact, and confidence-building measures are contributing to the gradual normalisation of the situation,” he said.  
  
“Concurrently, capability development and infrastructure enhancement are progressing through a whole-of-government approach,” he added.  
  
The Army chief said the situation in Jammu and Kashmir remains sensitive but firmly under control.

Amaroq Minerals (AMRQ): The Greenland Gold Play with a Geopolitical Moat,1qbrz1a,1,0,2026-01-13 13:57:19,TheRaul5677070,ValueInvesting,"**Current Price:** \~GBX 123 / CAD 2.29 **Market Cap:** \~£580m / CAD 1.06B

Amaroq just transitioned from a developer to a producer, beating its FY2025 production guidance during a commissioning year. You are buying a high-grade gold mine that is ramping up exactly as major banks (JPM, Goldman) forecast gold to hit $4,000-$5,000/oz in 2026. The kicker? The US government is actively looking to invest in Greenland to counter China, and Amaroq holds the keys to the region's copper and strategic minerals.

**1. The Cash Flow Engine is Live** Most junior miners fail because they can't build the mine. Amaroq has crossed that bridge.

* **Production Beat:** They just reported FY2025 production of \~6,600 oz, beating the midpoint of their 6-7koz guidance.
* **High Grade:** This is a narrow-vein deposit with historical grades of 18-28 g/t.High grade protects margins if prices dip.
* **Phase 2 Catalyst:** The real re-rate happens in Q2 2026. They are installing a flotation circuit to boost recovery rates to \~90%.This is pure margin expansion.

**2. The Macro Setup (Gold Supercycle)** The valuation looks reasonable at current gold prices, but it looks like a steal if you believe the institutional consensus for 2026/2027:

* **J.P. Morgan:** Forecasts $5,055/oz by Q4 2026.
* **Bank of America:** Sees upside to $5,000/oz.If gold goes to $4,000+, Amaroq's free cash flow from the Nalunaq mine alone could likely self-fund their massive exploration portfolio, eliminating the need for dilution.

**3. The Geopolitical ""Put"" Option** This is the unique value driver. The US is scrambling to secure critical minerals outside of China's control.

* **Strategic Assets:** Amaroq owns the Sava Copper Belt (potential IOCG system) and Stendalen (Nickel/PGM).
* **US Government Funding:** CEO Eldur Olafsson confirmed they are in discussions with US agencies regarding direct investment and infrastructure support.
* **The Moat:** If the US wants Greenland's minerals, Amaroq is the primary industrial partner in the region.

**Valuation & Asymmetry** The stock trades like a developer, but the risk profile has shifted to that of a producer. You are effectively paying for the gold mine and getting the copper/strategic minerals and the ""US National Security"" premium for free.

**Key Risks**

* **Nugget Effect:** The gold is coarse and erratic. Quarterly production will be volatile. You have to look at annual averages, not quarterly misses/beats.
* **Execution:** They need to deliver Phase 2 on time (Q2 2026) to hit the 90% recovery targets.
* **Logistics:** It's the Arctic. Weather can delay shipments and increase working capital requirements.

What if a healthier workday actually started later? (10–4 concept),1qbrv3o,1,0,2026-01-13 13:52:47,gypsy_moon8838,u_gypsy_moon8838,"It’s actually wild that we’ve normalized giving our best brain and body hours to employers and then expecting people to “live” on the leftovers after 6pm.

We act like it’s normal for a human being to wake up—immediately accelerate into performance—commute, produce, comply, stay “on,” manage stress, and hold it together… and then, once the best energy is spent, we tell them, “Now go be healthy. Now go be present. Now go be creative. Now go build relationships. Now go make a meaningful life.” As if the most important parts of being human are supposed to fit neatly into the smallest, most depleted slice of the day.

But the body doesn’t work like that. Circadian rhythm isn’t a preference; it’s biology. It governs sleep quality, stress hormones, appetite regulation, focus, mood, immune function, and recovery. When employment disrupts that rhythm—early starts, long commutes, rotating shifts, constant availability—it doesn’t just steal time. It steals your capacity. It takes the version of you that can think clearly, regulate emotions, move your body, plan meals, and connect. And then it leaves you with the tired version and calls it “balance” if you can still manage a workout, a healthy dinner, homework, laundry, meaningful conversation, and maybe a creative thought or two before collapsing.

That’s why so many people feel like they’re failing at wellness. Not because they lack discipline—but because the system purchases their best hours and returns their life to them when their nervous system is already spent.

And here’s the part we don’t say out loud: when this becomes the default, family life becomes a transaction with exhaustion. Partners get the short fuse. Kids get the distracted presence. Friendships fade because connection requires energy. Creativity dies because ideas require spaciousness. Cooking becomes another chore because nourishment requires time and attention. Even spirituality and self-reflection get crowded out because inner life needs quiet, not a sprint to bedtime.

A sane schedule would treat health and life as the foundation—not the hobby you attempt after work. Something like 10 or 11 to 4, with four or five genuinely focused hours, acknowledges what we all know: most people do not produce high-quality work for eight straight hours anyway. Beyond a certain point, we’re not working—we’re enduring. We’re sitting in artificial light, managing fatigue, and calling it productivity because we’re physically present.

Protecting the rest of the day isn’t laziness. It’s how you make room for the things that create actual resilience: morning light, movement, real meals, unhurried conversation, creative work, learning, play, rest, and time with your children while they are still awake and still wanting you. It’s how you turn “self-care” from a buzzword into a real, repeatable lifestyle.

Work should support a life. It should not consume the best parts of the day and then demand that the most meaningful parts of being human happen in the leftover hours—when your body is begging for recovery. If we want healthier people, healthier families, and healthier communities, we can’t keep designing schedules that require everyone to live on depletion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_gypsy_moon8838/comments/1qbrv3o/what_if_a_healthier_workday_actually_started/
please give advices how to correct this,1qbrtt6,1,1,2026-01-13 13:51:14,HonoraryManchurian,MutualfundsIndia,"Hi everyone,  
I’m a beginner investor and my earlier post was removed due to missing details, so I’m reposting with complete information. I’d really appreciate advice on how to improve or simplify my portfolio.I’m investing mostly via SIPs. My current holdings are:

* HDFC Defence Fund (Sectoral)
* Nippon India Large Cap Fund
* HDFC Hybrid Debt Fund
* Axis Small Cap Fund
* Aditya Birla PSU Equity Fund (Sectoral)
* SBI Gold Fund

The portfolio is equity-heavy with some exposure to sectoral funds, small caps, hybrid debt, and gold.

# Risk Tolerance-

* I understand that sectoral and small-cap funds are volatile
* I’m okay with short-term ups and downs but don’t want to take extreme or reckless risk

Investment Horizon -- 5-10 years No short term withdrawl needs at the moment i did spend some on coaching 30k

Reason Why did I choose those-

* Defence & PSU funds: long-term government and infrastructure growth
* Large cap fund: For relative stability compared to mid/small caps
* Small cap fund: For higher growth potential over long term
* Hybrid debt fund: To add some stability and reduce volatility
* Gold fund: For diversification and hedge against uncertainty Is this portfolio too risky for a beginner?Should I reduce or exit sectoral funds (Defence/PSU)?Would it be better to simplify into fewer diversified funds?I’m still learning🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 and open to corrections.

I am 22yo investin since a year

⚖️ Judge Clears Orsted to Resume RI Wind Project Federal stop-work order enjoined 👇,1qbroyn,1,0,2026-01-13 13:45:35,NoSpinMedia,NewEnglandContext,"On **Monday, January 12, 2026**, **U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth** granted a preliminary injunction allowing **Orsted** to resume construction on the **Revolution Wind** project off the coast of **Rhode Island**. The ruling halts a **Department of the Interior (DOI)** suspension issued on **December 22, 2025**, which had frozen five major offshore wind leases citing national security risks.

In his decision, **Judge Lamberth** ruled that the government failed to prove an immediate emergency existed that justified a total cessation of work on a project that is **87% complete**. The **DOI**, led by **Secretary Doug Burgum**, argued that recent **Pentagon** classified assessments revealed ""radar interference"" and ""clutter"" from turbine blades that could obscure military targets. However, the judge noted that the government waited a month after receiving these reports to act, undermining the claim of an imminent threat. He further cited **Secretary Burgum’s** public television interviews—where the Secretary criticized wind energy as ""expensive and unreliable"" for reasons unrelated to security—as a factor causing the court to question the administration's true motives.

The impact is critical for **Rhode Island** and **Connecticut**, which rely on the **700-megawatt** project to meet state renewable energy mandates. **Orsted** testified that the pause was costing **$1.5 million per day** and threatened the availability of specialized installation vessels contracted through **February 2026**. This injunction marks the second time in four months that **Revolution Wind** has successfully sued to block a federal stop-work order, following a similar legal victory in **September 2025**.

While work may now resume, the broader legal challenge regarding the **Administrative Procedure Act** continues. The **Department of Justice** argued that national security should outweigh economic harm, but the court found that the developer's ""reliance interests"" and the near-completion of the facility favored an injunction. Hearings for other halted projects, including **Empire Wind** and **Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind**, are scheduled for later this week.

Should the government be required to share classified security data with private developers before halting multi-billion dollar projects?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NewEnglandContext/comments/1qbroyn/judge_clears_orsted_to_resume_ri_wind_project/
Privatization of roads and public transport,1qbrotb,1,1,2026-01-13 13:45:27,Heinz32ab,Libertarian,"I'm from a small country, the Netherlands.

The Netherlands is basically full as fuck. We have high-quality roads, I would dare to say some of the best in the world. However, the road tax is also ridiculously high. Besides that, the government taxes the shit out of fuel too. Traffic jams are very common on most major highways during peak hours.

I am not denying that there is a lot of money being sent down the drain with public spending on things such as roads or public transport.

However, I fail to imagine how a complete privatization of the roads or public transport that doesn't involve the government could improve the situation, since obviously, roads or public transport aren't a completely free market or not even a free market at all.

In a free market, you would expect a more or less endless amount of potential competition, or at least a large enough amount to drive prices down and satisfy consumer needs. Examples could be markets such as restaurants, phones, shoes, bags, cars, etc.

For roads and transport, this obviously isn't the case. One cannot build an infinite amount of roads or railways to compete with existing roads or railways. In fact, in a country like the Netherlands, which is full to the brim, one could probably not even build one extra road or railway. Unless houses were being sold and demolished to build more roads, but houses is another thing we have a terrible shortage of.

  
In my view, if the roads were privatized, this would probably happen:

The government sells the roads to the highest bidder. The highest bidder would immediately have a monopoly and could impose ridiculous amounts of toll to people who would literally have no alternative, except to take the also newly privatized trains, which would be completely packed and overpriced, since the same situation would have happened. Another solution would be for people to take other roads, but traffic jams would be insane on those roads, and they might have ridiculous tolls too.

In fact, there might not even be any incentive for the highest bidder to have traffic on its road. What if the highest bidder simply wants to buy the road as an investment and let it be empty until they sell it for more money? Or let's say Amazon decides to buy the A1, A2 and A4, three of the major highways in our country. They use it for transporting their packages cheaply, but impose ridiculous tolls of 10 EUR per km to others who want to use the road, so that the road is basically almost never used. Just because they want to have a competitive advantage over other companies and invest in the road for future profit.

Even in the best scenario, we would have 20 companies controlling all our roads, and every company would have a different payment method, card, etc. which would make everything needlessly complex.

I fail to see how this would have any positive impact. Yes, we might reduce our tax burden and public wasting of money, but I think most people would prefer to just pay double automatically to the government, so that they wouldn't be inconvenienced by tolls, different payment systems, difficult cost calculations, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1qbrotb/privatization_of_roads_and_public_transport/

Please review the structure of my story.,1qbrkgf,0,0,2026-01-13 13:40:21,adityaaa00777,KeepWriting,"NOT WORTH SAVING
Prologue – A World of Deviants
The world had learned to live with them.
Deviants—humans whose bodies defied natural limits through purely physical evolution. No magic. No divine gifts. Only flesh, bone, and will, pushed beyond what science could explain. Strength that shattered steel. Speed that bent perception. Minds that could calculate futures before they happened.
For decades, nations used them as weapons. Governments built task forces. Corporations built private armies. Wars were no longer fought only by soldiers, but by singular beings capable of changing history alone.
From this chaos rose three figures who would become both saviors and monsters in the eyes of the world.
They were called the Holy Trinity.
Chapter 1 – The Holy Trinity
They were brothers in everything but blood.
A – The Strategist
A possessed limited precognition: not the power to see everything, but the ability to read possibilities with frightening accuracy. Combined with his unmatched tactical intellect, he became the greatest battlefield commander of the Deviant age. He did not believe everyone could be saved. He believed in choosing what could be saved.
Cold logic guided him. But emotion still bled into his decisions. That contradiction defined him.
Later, he would enter politics.
S – The Beast
S was raw physical dominance. When he entered Beast Mode, he became something beyond human—strength, endurance, and killing instinct magnified into a living weapon. He did not care about public image, ideology, or governance. To him, battle was truth.
He followed A not because of authority, but because A’s vision gave his power meaning.
T – The Projection
T’s ability allowed him to project physical attacks beyond his body—turning motion itself into a weapon. He was not weaker than the others. He was the second fastest among the top deviants, surpassed only by one man: U.
Unlike S, T believed in order, duty, and responsibility. He would eventually dedicate himself fully to the state.
Together, A, S, and T formed a force no nation could ignore.
They commanded armies of Deviants. They shaped wars. And they made decisions that would stain history.
Chapter 2 – The Great Evil War
The world’s greatest conflict did not begin with ideology. It began with fear.
A coalition of rogue states and extremist Deviant factions formed what would later be called “The Great Evil.” Their goal was not conquest—it was annihilation of existing global order. Cities burned. Governments collapsed. Civilian death became collateral.
The Holy Trinity stood at the center of the resistance.
S tore through enemy strongholds in direct combat.
T neutralized elite units with precision strikes.
A orchestrated entire theaters of war, predicting enemy movement and sacrificing sectors to save others.
Thousands died.
Not because the Trinity desired it—but because war made it unavoidable.
They saved what they could. They abandoned what they couldn’t.
And the world survived.
But something darker followed.
Chapter 3 – The Fourth Power: U
U was different.
Where A relied on calculation, U relied on perfection. Faster than T. Strong enough to challenge S. Brilliant without needing strategy. He was what many called “God’s favorite.”
But U believed something the Trinity did not.
He believed their methods were wrong.
He saw A’s choices as moral crimes disguised as logic. He believed S was nothing more than destruction incarnate. He viewed T as blind loyalty to a flawed system.
During the war, U secretly aligned himself with the enemy.
Not because he supported The Great Evil’s goals—but because he believed the Trinity themselves were the greater threat to humanity.
His allies:
G, a lightning-based close combat specialist.
K, a brutal, relentless fighter trained in overwhelming physical combat.
Both were originally part of The Great Evil.
U betrayed both sides.
Chapter 4 – The Final War
As the Great Evil collapsed, three battles happened simultaneously:
A vs K – A defeated K through superior tactics.
S vs the Great Evil Leader – S obliterated the enemy’s core.
T vs G – Their battle ended in a stalemate.
Then the Trinity united and ended the war in a final 3 vs 1, erasing the last command of The Great Evil.
The war was over.
But peace never came.
Chapter 5 – A vs U
After the enemy had fallen, U emerged.
Not as a liberator.
As an executioner.
He began slaughtering surviving enemy soldiers—and civilians. Non-combatants. Anyone left in the ruins.
To U, this was justice.
A confronted him.
They fought.
A was exhausted. He had already survived multiple battles. His precognition was strained. His body was breaking.
U was fresh.
U overwhelmed him.
A fell.
U attempted to finish him.
But S and T intervened.
With reinforcements arriving, U fled.
The war ended with a lie written into history.
The world blamed the Holy Trinity for the aftermath: the civilian deaths, the destruction, the horror that followed victory.
No one knew the truth.
Except them.
Chapter 6 – Politics and Propaganda
Years passed.
A entered politics.
He became a state leader. And not a symbolic one—a genuine architect of reform. Under his rule, quality of life improved. Infrastructure was rebuilt. Poverty declined. Education and security stabilized.
He wrote books explaining his ideology: logic over emotion, sacrifice over sentiment, survival over idealism.
Thousands read them.
Many questioned the official narrative.
Could a man capable of such rational clarity truly be responsible for mass slaughter?
T devoted himself to government, becoming the public face of lawful authority.
S withdrew from society. He did not care for reputation. He did not defend himself.
And U waited.
The Holy Trinity had no international reputation. The war had stained them permanently.
U used that.
He began a campaign of political warfare—trying to convince the world that the civilian deaths were not consequences of war, but deliberate acts ordered by A, executed by S and T.
But it failed.
A’s image only grew stronger.
Chapter 7 – The Coup
Elections approached.
U could not win legally.
He would not wait another five years.
If power could not be taken by law, it would be taken by force.
U revealed himself.
Alongside G and K, he raised an army of over 20,000 Deviants.
The Three Heads of the Dragon marched.
The Holy Trinity stood in their path.
This was no longer politics.
This was war.
Chapter 8 – Ideology Before Blood
Before the battle, A and U spoke.
They argued.
Logic versus perfection. Sacrifice versus purity. Hard work versus talent. Humanity’s peak versus divinity’s favorite.
Neither would yield.
Neither would understand.
The war began.
Chapter 9 – The Three Battles
The battlefield split into three destinies:
S vs G
Brute force against precision. Beast against lightning. A battle of overwhelming destruction that reshaped the land.
T vs K
Speed against brutality. Technique against relentless power. T proved he was no weaker—second only to U in raw velocity.
A vs U
Strategist versus perfection. Cold logic versus absolute confidence.
Masterpiece versus flawlessness.
The world burned again.
Cities collapsed.
Civilians died.
History repeated itself.
Chapter 10 – The End of U
A won.
But not cleanly.
He killed U.
And in doing so, relived everything he had tried to bury.
The war against The Great Evil.
The civilians.
The choices.
The deaths.
The world once again paid the price of Deviants.
Victory tasted like failure.
Chapter 11 – Aftermath
A did not claim power.
He did not celebrate.
He disappeared.
He handed political authority to T, entrusting the future to governance rather than force.
The world never saw him again.
Some believed he lived in isolation.
Some believed he was preparing for another catastrophe.
Some believed he was dead.
No one knew.
Epilogue – What Remains
T ruled.
Not as a tyrant.
But as a servant.
Order replaced chaos.
S vanished into the mountains.
There, he joined a Deviant school.
Not to create weapons.
But to teach.
To shape a new generation—one that would learn to protect instead of destroy.
And A?
His future was left unanswered.
If a world-ending threat were to rise again…
Would he return?
Or would humanity face it alone?
The world survived.
But at a cost too great to justify.
Some stories are not about heroes.
Some victories are not worth celebrating.
Some worlds…
are simply

Can you please explain me why you support monarchy or why you think monarchy is needed in Nepal,1qbrdgh,5,8,2026-01-13 13:31:41,Positive-Sign7692,NepalSocial,"I am so confused like why in the world you think it’s the right time to bring back king 

The so-called king sits comfortably in an air-conditioned room, records a five-minute video, and suddenly pretends to care about the nation. Meanwhile, his supporters take to the streets, creating chaos and disturbing the peace of the country in the name of monarchy. This is not patriotism this is irresponsibility.

This is the same king who failed to ensure a proper and transparent investigation into the brutal killing of his own brother and the entire royal family, despite holding absolute power. The same king under whose watch royal privilege went unchecked, where his own son could recklessly drive on public roads as if the country belonged to him personally.

A leader is supposed to protect democracy and unite the people, not dismantle institutions for personal control. Under his rule:

1.	A royal coup took place, crushing democratic governance.

2.	Media and civil rights were suppressed, silencing journalists and citizens.

3.	The people were pushed to the streets, leading to Jana Andolan, where citizens had to fight just to reclaim their basic rights.

Only after massive public resistance did he give up power—and now, years later, he wants to act as if everything he did was “for the people.” History doesn’t work that way",https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1qbrdgh/can_you_please_explain_me_why_you_support/
Open Letter to Trustee Barbara D. Houser,1qbrcwy,6,6,2026-01-13 13:31:01,WanderlustLiam,BSA_Survivors,"Re: Post–January 12, 2026 Supreme Court Denial; Rehearing Window; Escrow Release; Second Distribution Readiness

January 13, 2026

Barbara D. Houser  
Trustee, Boy Scouts of America Settlement Trust (the “Trust”)  
c/o Trust Administration

Subject: Immediate operational readiness for Second Distribution upon expiration of the Rule 44 rehearing window

Ms. Houser,

I am writing this as an open letter on January 13, 2026, on behalf of myself and in solidarity with the thousands of sexual abuse survivors whose claims fall under the Trust’s administration. Many of us have been following the Trust’s Litigation Update closely and have waited—patiently and in good faith—for the Trust to move beyond the initial distribution phase and into the next meaningful step toward full and fair compensation.

On January 12, 2026, the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of Certiorari filed by a small subset of dissenting survivors. The Trust has correctly noted that, although the standard is very high, those petitioners may attempt to file a petition for rehearing within the applicable window (commonly described as 25 days, i.e., by February 6, 2026, absent modification). The Trust has further stated that finality is contingent upon whether such a rehearing petition is filed and, if filed, how the Supreme Court disposes of it.

Let me be clear: while survivors understand that the rehearing mechanism exists procedurally, the likelihood of the Supreme Court granting rehearing after denying certiorari is extraordinarily remote. The possibility of a rehearing petition does not change the reality that survivors have been waiting through prolonged delays, while a substantial sum has remained held in escrow and the initial distribution has remained minimal relative to allowed claim amounts.

1. Notice of survivor expectations: “readiness” must be complete now

Accordingly, I am providing this letter as formal notice that survivors expect the Trust to use this rehearing window not as a justification for delay, but as a final opportunity to ensure complete operational readiness so that Second Distributions can begin immediately upon lawful release of escrowed funds.

This means the Trust should already be completing now, during this window, each of the following:

* Final modeling and sensitivity analyses for second distribution percentages across realistic scenarios;
* Coordination and execution planning with the STAC and FCR so the percentage can be announced without delay;
* Finalization of lien holdback protocols and operational flows so that lien issues do not halt or slow distributions globally;
* Payment batch readiness, QA controls, audit trails, and disbursement systems validation;
* Clear public communications to survivors and counsel explaining timing, methodology, and what to expect.

In short: the Trust should be treating the period between January 13 and February 6, 2026 as the final operational sprint. Survivors should not be told “we are now starting to do the math” after the rehearing window closes. That work must already be done.

2) Escrow release and Second Distribution timing

Survivors have been informed repeatedly-directly and indirectly-that once the plan is final and escrow restrictions are lifted, escrowed funds can be released and Second Distributions can begin. Survivors have also seen communications that reference a substantial escrow amount being held pending Supreme Court resolution.

If the Trust is operationally prepared, then when the rehearing period expires (or, if filed, when any rehearing request is denied), the Trust should be able to move directly into:

* Confirmation of escrow release mechanics;
* Receipt reconciliation;
* Immediate commencement of Second Distribution payment issuance.

If delays occur after that point, survivors will reasonably view those delays as administrative and managerial failures, not legal inevitabilities.

3) Survivors are organized, informed, and united

It is also important that the Trust understand the current survivor landscape has changed significantly over the last year. Survivors are no longer isolated. We have been networking, comparing notes, sharing source documents, tracking updates, and coordinating across states and firms. Many of us are now actively monitoring the Trust’s communications and operational execution in real time.

With that in mind, please consider this letter a respectful but unequivocal statement:

* Survivors expect timely, transparent execution of Second Distributions as soon as legally permissible; and
* Survivors will be watching for any unjustified administrative delay or shifting explanations.

1. Reservation of rights; intent to seek Court oversight if necessary

Nothing in this letter is intended to be hostile. It is intended to be clear.

Survivors reserve all rights available under the governing Trust documents and applicable bankruptcy jurisdiction to seek appropriate relief, oversight, and accountability from the United States Bankruptcy Court if the Trust fails to act with reasonable speed, transparency, and diligence once legal conditions to distribute are satisfied.

Put plainly: once the rehearing window closes (or rehearing is denied), there should be no “new reason” for delay. Survivors have waited long enough.

5) Request for public commitment

I respectfully request that the Trust publicly commit-now-to the following:

1. That Second Distribution percentage modeling and operational readiness are being finalized during the rehearing window;
2. That the Trust will announce a target timeline and operational plan for issuing Second Distributions promptly upon lawful receipt of escrow funds;
3. That any future delays be explained with specificity, not generalities.

Survivors deserve closure. Survivors deserve progress. Survivors deserve a Trust that is prepared to act the moment the legal gate opens.

Respectfully,

Liam

What are the worst races you've ever watched?,1qbr45c,28,131,2026-01-13 13:20:19,RobbieJ4444,formula1,"Sometimes a race comes and goes from your memory, but there are also times where a race was so bad, it will forever remain in my memory. Here are some of my least favourites:

**2013 Belgian Grand Prix:** The qualifying for this was so exciting, and yet the race was just Sebastian Vettel dominating from start to finish. The only real highlight for me was that Maldonado somehow crashed into both Force Indias on the same corner. It also didn't help that I was watching this race live in the USA at the time, so I basically stayed up all night for nothing.

**2014 Austrian Grand Prix:** It's amazing how Austria has become one of the most reliable tracks for great racing, considering how bad the first race was on its reintroduction to the calendar. The entire race can be summed up as watching Lewis Hamilton failing to make any impression of Valterri Bottas. That was it...for the entire race.

**2017 Russian Grand Prix:** Bottas' first F1 win, and the race I've seen in my entire life. After lap one, not only were there no on track overtakes whatsoever, but almost nobody was ever in DRS throughout the entire race.

**2018 Canadian Grand Prix:** Remember the hyper soft tyres Pirelli made to force cars into making two stops. What it actually resulted in were one stop strategies where the drivers had to be EVEN MORE conservative. Nothing happened in the race, but it was nice seeing promising rookie Leclerc get a point. Other than that, the hyper soft tyres were a complete and utter failure.

**2019 French Grand Prix:** Of the races we got in Paul Ricard, 2020 was a classic, 2018 was good, and 2019 was such a disaster, people were furious, demanding that F1 stepped up its game, and declaring Paul Ricard the creator of terrible races, even thought this was its only awful race.

**2020 Belgian Grand Prix:** Belgium has come under fire for a while now, but this was the grand prix where I remember this discussion happening. Gasly was the only driver making moves. Everyone else was gridlocked, with Verstappen declaring that F1 cars are too fast nowadays to be good at overtaking.

**2022 Baku and 2022 French Grand Prix:** Both these races have the same problem. The race is building up to a thrilling duel between Leclerc and Verstappen, and then Leclerc retires, giving Verstappen an easy win.

**2023 Bahrain Grand Prix:** This race was so depressing to watch, because the gaps between everyone were huge already, but the two Red Bulls were gargantuan. It effectively and efficiently told me that there was no way in hell anybody else other than Red Bull was going to win ANY race that year. God, 2023 was so depressing.

**2018 Australian and 2024 Baku Grand Pix:** These two races are perfectly fine on their own, but they leave a bitter pill in my mouth, because the driver I wanted to win (Hamilton and Leclerc) got overtaken by a driver I didn't want to win (Vettel and Piastri) and so I fast forwarded the rest of the race to the point where Hamilton and Leclerc got their lead back, and I ended up skipping the entire race, because that event never happened.

**2025 Japanese Grand Prix:** On one of the first few laps, Hamilton overtook Hadjar. That is a summary of all the on track action in the top 10.",https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1qbr45c/what_are_the_worst_races_youve_ever_watched/

"21M, Failed CA Foundation 3 Times, Tier-3 College — Feeling Lost in Life. What Would You Do If You Were Me?",1qbqwxa,2,5,2026-01-13 13:11:18,light_yagami077,Indian_Academia,"Hey everyone,  
I don’t usually post things like this, but I’m genuinely stuck right now and thought I’d ask for some advice here.

**Qualifications / background (for context):**

* **10th:** 85%
* **12th (Commerce):** 88%
* **Currently:** 2nd year [**B.Com**](http://B.Com) student (Tier-3 college)
* **CA Foundation:** Attempted 3 times, failed all 3

Academically, I’ve always been decent — not a topper, but not weak either. That’s why failing CA Foundation repeatedly has hit my confidence pretty hard. At this point, I keep questioning myself:

* Is CA just not for me?
* Am I studying the wrong way or lacking proper guidance?
* When do you stop pushing and start changing direction?

My family’s financial situation is **average** — we’re managing fine, but I can’t afford to keep trying things endlessly without results. My college also doesn’t offer much exposure or placements, so most of the responsibility is on me to figure out a path.

What’s mentally exhausting is watching people my age move ahead — internships, jobs, plans — while I feel stuck and overthinking everything.

I’m not looking for sympathy or motivational lines. I’m genuinely looking for **practical, honest advice**.

Some things I’d really appreciate input on:

* Is it worth continuing **CA after 3 failed attempts**, or should I accept that it’s not for me?
* If not CA, what are **realistic alternatives** for someone with a [B.Com](http://B.Com) background?
* What skills or career paths in India are actually worth investing time in right now?
* How can someone from a Tier-3 college slowly build a better career in the next few years?

If you’ve been through something similar — dropped CA, switched paths, or felt lost in your early 20s — your experience would really help.

Thanks a lot for reading. Any advice is appreciated 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/1qbqwxa/21m_failed_ca_foundation_3_times_tier3_college/
Countries and Governments Around the World Now Urging Plant-Based Diets for Health & Climate,1qbqv44,1,0,2026-01-13 13:09:00,Firm_Relative_7283,u_Firm_Relative_7283,"Across the world, governments are beginning to acknowledge something climate scientists, public health experts, and food system researchers have been saying for years: we cannot protect human health or stabilize the climate without shifting diets toward plants. 

What’s notable about this moment is not just the science, but the policy response. Countries are no longer treating plant-based eating as a personal lifestyle choice alone. Instead, they are increasingly embedding it into national dietary guidelines, climate strategies, public procurement rules, and health recommendations.

While few governments explicitly tell citizens to go fully vegan, many are now doing something just as significant: officially urging populations to eat substantially more plant foods and far less animal products, often citing both environmental and health benefits. From national action plans and food guides to climate-aligned nutrition frameworks, these policies represent a quiet but meaningful shift in how governments think about food, responsibility, and long-term resilience.

Below are countries that are already urging their citizens toward more plant-based diets.

🇩🇰 Denmark – Action Plan for Plant-Based Foods

In October 2023, [Denmark](https://en.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/food/nutrition-and-health/the-official-dietary-guidelines) announced the world’s first national Action Plan for Plant-Based Foods, designed to boost production and consumption of climate-friendly foods and support plant-based innovation across sectors. This initiative includes education, public procurement, R&D, and business incentives.

""The Official Dietary Guidelines - good for health and climate are: Eat plant-rich, varied and not too much, Eat more vegetables and fruit, Eat less meat – choose legumes and fish...""

🇳🇱 The Netherlands – Balanced Dietary Guidelines & Support for Plant Proteins

The [Netherlands](https://proveg.org/news/seven-countries-leading-the-way-in-plant-based-food-policies-in-2024/) is often highlighted for its balanced national dietary guidelines that strongly support plant-based foods and alternatives. It also backs innovations like cultivated meat through significant funding.


🇨🇦 Canada – Revised Food Guide Emphasizing Plant Protein

[Canada’s](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/healthy-eating-recommendations/) 2019 revision of Canada’s Food Guide fundamentally shifted away from separate meat and dairy groups, instead encouraging plant-based protein as the default option and placing vegetables and fruits at the center of meals.

""Many of the well-studied healthy eating patterns include mostly plant-based foods.

Plant-based foods can include vegetables and fruits, whole grain foods, plant-based protein foods.

Eating plant-based foods regularly can mean eating more fibre and less saturated fat. This can have a positive effect on health, including a lowered risk of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes.""

In 2024, the [German](https://ivu.org/nutrition/global-endorsements-a-100-plant-based-diet-by-institutions.html) Nutrition Society (DGE) updated its stance on plant-based diets, acknowledging them as health-promoting and environmentally advantageous when well planned.


🇫🇮🇳🇴🇸🇪 Finland, Norway, and Sweden – Nordic Nutrition Recommendations

[Finland](https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/en/foodstuffs/healthy-diet/), [Norway](https://www.helsenorge.no/en/kosthold-og-ernaring/dietary-guidelines/), and [Sweden](https://www.norden.org/en/publication/nordic-nutrition-recommendations-2023) jointly follow the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR), which have steadily shifted toward a strongly plant-forward dietary model. The most recent updates explicitly link diet to climate impact, biodiversity loss, and long-term public health, urging reduced meat consumption and a much higher share of calories from plant foods.

Finland: ""Health-promoting eating habits and diets are mainly based on plant products, or whole grain cereals, vegetables, berries and fruit. A healthy diet also contains fish, vegetable oils and other sources of unsaturated fats, including nuts and seeds. A versatile diet can contain a moderate amount of poultry meat and some red meat. A diet composed of these elements will provide you with high quantities of vitamins, minerals and fibre, and high-quality carbohydrates, proteins and fats in suitable proportions.""

""The Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) constitute the scientific basis for national dietary guidelines and nutrient recommendations in the Nordic and Baltic countries...the NNR2023 recommends: A predominantly plant-based diet high in vegetables, fruits, berries, pulses, potatoes and whole grains. Ample intake of fish and nuts. Moderate intake of low-fat dairy products. Limited intake of red meat and poultry. Minimal intake of processed meat, alcohol, and processed foods containing high amounts of fats, salt and sugar.""


🇹🇼 Taiwan – Government Promotion of Plant-Based & Low-Meat Diets

[Taiwan](https://ivu.org/nutrition/global-endorsements-a-100-plant-based-diet-by-institutions.html) has actively promoted plant-based and vegetarian diets through government agencies, public health campaigns, and institutional food policies. The country’s dietary guidance highlights plant foods for chronic disease prevention and environmental sustainability, and Taiwan is frequently cited as a global leader in plant-based food culture.


🇦🇹 Austria – Climate-Aligned Dietary Guidance & Public Food Policy

[Austria’s](https://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/regions/countries/austria/en/) national dietary recommendations and climate strategies increasingly emphasize plant-based foods as central to both health and environmental protection. Official guidance encourages significantly higher consumption of plant foods and reduced intake of meat, particularly red and processed meat.

""Proteins:

Step 2. Vegetables, legumes and fruits. Eat five servings of vegetables, legumes and fruits every day. The ideal would be to eat three servings of vegetables and/or legumes and two servings of fruit (one serving = one clenched fist). Eat vegetables partly raw and consider seasonal and regional availability when selecting fruits and vegetables.

Step 4. Milk and dairy products. Eat three servings of milk and dairy products every day. Prefer low-fat versions.

Step 5. Fish, meat, sausages and eggs. Eat at least one or two servings of fish (150 g) a week. Prefer high-fat fish such as mackerel, salmon, tuna and herring or local cold water fish such as river trout. Eat up to three servings of lean meat or low-fat sausages a week (300–450 g). Eat red meat (such as beef, pork and lamb) and sausages in moderation. Eat up to 3 eggs a week.""

🇫🇷 France – Reduced Meat Guidance & Mandatory Vegetarian Meals

[France](https://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/regions/countries/france/en/) has taken concrete policy steps to reduce meat consumption, particularly through public food programs. National dietary guidelines encourage limiting red and processed meat while increasing legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. France has also mandated regular vegetarian meals in schools, making plant-based eating part of everyday public life. The diet guidelines are framed around both health and environmental sustainability.

""Proteins:

The guide recommends increasing:

 a small handful of unsalted nuts per day

the consumption of pulses (beans, lentils, chickpeas, etc), at least twice a week 

The guide recommends moving towards:

fish, twice a week including one oily fish (sardines, mackerel, herring, salmon) 

dairy products (milk, yoghurt, cheese and cottage cheese), 2 per day for adults.

 The guide recommends limiting:

the consumption of meats, while favouring poultry and limiting other meats (pork, beef, veal, mutton, lamb, offal) to 500 g per week

the consumption of processed meat, to 150 g per week""



🇧🇪 Belgium – Plant-Forward Guidelines & Weekly Veggie Day

[Belgium’s](https://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/regions/countries/belgium/en/) national dietary guidelines explicitly encourage mostly plant-based diets, with plant foods forming the core of daily meals. The country is also known for pioneering weekly vegetarian days in public institutions, especially in cities like Ghent.

""Proteins: Eat legumes every week: this allows you to combine certain proteins and essential amino acids from a variety of sources. Replace meat with legumes at least once a week. Another advantage is that the cultivation and production of legumes has a low impact on climate because the production of vegetable proteins results in lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to the production of animal proteins. Eat 15 to 25 g of plain nuts or seeds (unsalted and/or without a sweet coating) every day; a handful is about 30 g. Nuts contain useful fats, proteins and fibres. Walnuts, for example, are high in omega-3 fatty acids.""

🇪🇸 Spain – Climate-Linked Dietary Recommendations

[Spain’s](https://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-dietary-guidelines/regions/countries/spain/en/) public health authorities have increasingly linked diet, climate change, and chronic disease, urging reduced consumption of red and processed meat while encouraging more plant-based foods consistent with a modernized Mediterranean diet.

""The guidelines are accompanied by a healthy eating plate which consists of 50 percent fruits and vegetables, 25 percent whole grains, and 25 percent healthy protein.""

""Proteins: Per week, eat at least 4 servings of legumes, 3 or more servings of fish, 3 or more servings of nuts (up to a maximum of 1 serving/day) and up to 4 eggs. Up to 3 servings per day of milk and dairy products, preferably without added sugars and with low salt content. A maximum of 3 servings/week of meat, prioritising poultry and rabbit meat and minimising the consumption of processed meat.""


🇬🇧 United Kingdom – Official Calls to Cut Meat & Expand Plant Foods

[UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide) government advisory bodies and public health agencies have repeatedly recommended substantial reductions in meat consumption, citing both climate targets and health outcomes. Plant-based foods are increasingly emphasized in official guidance and sustainability strategies.

""Proteins: 

Beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other sources: Eat more beans and pulses, 2 sources of sustainably sourced fish per week, one of which is oily. Eat less red and processed meat.

Dairy and alternatives: Choose lower sugar and lower fat options.""

World Health & Nutrition Bodies Encouraging Plant-Rich Diets 🌼 

Several international and national dietary guidelines — including WHO Europe and the UN FAO/WHO joint recommendations — highlight plant-rich diets as beneficial for health and environmental sustainability, and countries that integrate these into their food guides effectively urge citizens toward plant-focused eating.

The “[Diets Toolkit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-sNOfrCE60u46WBrekWqHbmxR_oDYiMS/view)” launched at COP30 provides guidance for governments on promoting plant-based foods in schools and public institutions.

The EAT-Lancet Planetary Health Diet 🌼 

The [Planetary Health Diet](https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet/the-planetary-health-diet/) is a global reference diet based on the best available science. It represents a dietary pattern that supports optimal health outcomes and can be applied globally for different populations and different contexts, while also supporting cultural and regional variation. The PHD is rich in plants: whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes comprise a large proportion of foods consumed, with only moderate or small amounts of fish, dairy, and meat recommended. The PHD is based entirely on the direct effects of different diets on human health, not on environmental criteria. The diet’s name arose from the evidence suggesting that its adoption would reduce the environmental impacts and nutritional deficiencies of most current diets. [Five of the seven breached planetary boundaries are linked to food systems](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-stories/2025-10-03-eat-lancet-2025-global-food-transformation-needed-to-ease-pressure-on-the-planet-and-save-millions-of-lives.html). By transforming production and adopting a “planetary health diet,” we can halve food-related climate emissions and prevent millions of deaths.

Other Countries 🌼 

It’s also important to recognize that for much of the world, plant-based diets are not new at all. Countries and regions such as India, Ethiopia, parts of Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, and Okinawa (Japan) have long traditions of diets centered on legumes, whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and minimal animal products. These populations have historically shown lower rates of heart disease, certain cancers, obesity, and diet-related chronic illness, and several are well known longevity hotspots. India, home to the world’s largest population of vegetarians, demonstrates that large-scale plant-based eating is culturally viable, affordable, and nutritionally sufficient. The Mediterranean region’s traditionally plant-dominant diet has been repeatedly associated with reduced cardiovascular risk, while Okinawa’s largely plant-based pattern is strongly linked to exceptional longevity. 

When viewed alongside modern policy shifts in Europe, Asia, and parts of the Americas, these long-standing dietary patterns show that the global movement away from meat-heavy diets is not a radical departure, but rather a return to food systems that supported human health for generations, now reinforced by climate and public health science.",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Firm_Relative_7283/comments/1qbqv44/countries_and_governments_around_the_world_now/

First restart,1qbohbf,21,6,2026-01-13 11:02:05,Azanore,TerraInvicta,"Yesterday, I decided to drop my first run after playing it for nearly 40 hours and wanted to share my experience because it's fun.

As a good newbie, I played Resistance. I controlled nearly all European countries merged into the European Union in 2042. I spoiled Russia, did a nuclear war with India leading to nearly 200 million Indian death, just for the sake of destroying what I couldn't control and started a balkanisation of China.
USA was behind because the AI was never able to fix the country but after China, it would have probably been my next target.

Overall, I feel I was doing not-so-bad on Earth because I was the only remaining major power but the Servants and the Protectorate were still a pain.
The Aliens were coming and should have arrived in 2043 so I think my situation was about to change.

My main issue was space. 
I was denied LEO since at least 10 years. Every station in-building was always destroyed by Protectorate or the Servants. I decided then to go on Mercury to gather some ressources and build a new fleet there to come back later.
That fleet destroyed a few alien ships and I could re-established some station around Earth.
However, the alien retaliation destroyed it leaving my stations undefended. I tried to rebuilt but again, the Protectorate always the destroyed it.
The Aliens came for me on Mercury too so in 2042, I was back 10 years ago with no space assets. I was still low in ressources because I was late for Moon, Mars and Asteroid belt race. I neglected space for too long which led to the trouble I had.

I think it would have been recoverable but it would have taken 10 more years. I decided then to drop and start over with Exodus.

In my new game, I'm much better with already EU containing France, Germany and Italy and a CP in USA (I'm alone there for the moment). First on the Moon, first on Mars, first on Ceres. 

I love that game !

Vikramaditya Singh alleges that some Bureaucracts from the states of UP-Bihar are not working in the interest of the state.,1qblxma,18,7,2026-01-13 08:21:48,jonsnowmf,HimachalPradesh,"Personally I also agree with the statement. Having interacted with many people from other states like UP-Bihar, I have observed that their motivation for corruption is very high. Plus the Bureaucracy from other states have repeatedly lobbied for relaxation of section 118. 

During the Jairam government in 2021, many permission for 118 were granted to bureaucracy against the rules. Government employees from other states are allowed to buy land upto 500sq metres to build a house after completing 30 years of service in the state. But even bureaucrats with just 7 years of experience were given permission to buy 5 bighas of land. Most people have bought land in the range of 2 to 5 Bigha which is in clear violation of the rules. 

Compared to someone from Himachal, where people live a comfortable life with a simple government job, and when you combine that with small but equitable land holdings, it makes for less corruption or zero corruption. Thats the reason why we are one of the least corrupt states in India.

There is a stark contrast with other states where income inquality is very high and bureaucracy see their job as a way to amass huge wealth.

I'm not denying the fact that their is corruption but corruption is mainly at the level of bureaucracy and contractors. Bureaucracy asking making from common people to get work done is rarely seen and it often ends up in people complaining and leading to vigilance probe. 

My father in 61 years of his life has never paid a single rupee in Bribe for any work. Contrast that to other states where a simple Bonafide certificate would require you to pay a Rs1000.

Indian standards need uplifting!,1qbl3js,59,16,2026-01-13 07:28:53,jethaalaal,IndiaSpeaks,"l've been staying in Ireland for a couple years now and and something I keep noticing is how much higher the everyday safety standards are compared with India.

Take roadworks as an example. This is how arrangements are made on roads even for minor repairs. A fenced perimeter is made around the area, roads are cordoned off from a distance so that cars don't have to turn back and even temorary kerb ramps are put in place for strollers or wheelchair users to get on and off the footpath.

In India, the picture is often very different. Half-built flyovers are left without barricades, manholes are left uncovered and people are left to watch out for themselves.

This is not even about saving costs or corruption since it costs next to nothing to put up a makeshift fence.

Do you think if the solution proposed can make India corruption free?,1qbicgy,18,20,2026-01-13 04:54:55,nitinku5021a,AskIndia,"Hi,

So I asked GPT, what it would do if it were the PM of India to make it corruption free in 5 years and here is the solution it proposed. Do you think its doable? If not why?

**If I Were Prime Minister of India for 5 Years — How I’d End Corruption (Systematically)**

I’m answering this as a **systems designer**, not a moral preacher or populist politician.

**Core belief:**  
Corruption is not a people problem.  
It’s a **system design failure**.

If incentives, discretion, opacity, and enforcement are misaligned, corruption becomes the *rational equilibrium*—even for decent people.

My goal wouldn’t be to *emotionally fight corruption*, but to **make it structurally irrational**.

 

**First Principles (Non-Negotiable)**

1. **Discretion + Opacity + Low probability of punishment = Corruption**
2. You don’t fight corruption with speeches or raids
3. You fight it with:



* Automation
* Radical transparency
* Auditability
* *Certainty* of punishment (not harshness)

Harsh punishment without certainty changes nothing.  
Certainty without drama changes behavior.

 

**PHASE 1 (Year 0–1): Remove Human Discretion Where It Matters**

**1. Kill “Officer Approval” as a Concept**

Any process that requires *“file goes to officer X for approval”* is corruption-prone.

**Action:**

* Replace approvals with **rule engines**
* If inputs satisfy rules → output is automatic
* Officers handle **exceptions only** (fully logged)

**Applies to:**

* GST refunds
* Income tax scrutiny selection
* Land registration
* Building permits
* Environmental clearances
* Customs assessment
* Licenses & permits

No discretion → no bribe negotiation.

 

**2. Algorithmic Decision Systems (ADS) — Mandatory**

Every major government decision system must:

* Publish decision logic
* Be externally auditable
* Log every override

Overrides require:

* Officer identity
* Written justification
* Automatic audit trigger

Corruption thrives in undocumented exceptions.

 

**PHASE 2 (Year 1–2): Radical Transparency of State Power**

**3. Total Public Asset Disclosure (Machine-Readable)**

All elected officials + senior bureaucrats:

* Annual asset & liability disclosure
* Public
* Machine-readable (not PDFs)
* Change-tracked year-to-year

Automatic trigger if:

net worth change >> declared income

No raids. No vendetta. Just math.

 

**4. Public Spending Ledger (Near-Real-Time)**

All government spending above ₹10,000:

* Logged publicly
* Vendor, amount, department, purpose
* Open API for citizens & journalists

Think **GitHub for public money**.

Corruption hates visibility.

 

**PHASE 3 (Year 2–3): Enforcement Without Fear or Favor**

**5. Independent Prosecution Authority (IPA)**

Separate **investigation** from **prosecution**.

* Prosecutors cannot be transferred by executive
* Budget charged to Consolidated Fund
* Fixed tenure
* Performance metric: **speed of resolution**, not conviction rate

This structural separation is where India currently fails.

 

**6. Fast-Track Corruption Courts**

* Mandatory verdict within 12 months
* No adjournment games
* Digital evidence only
* Case auto-dismissed if prosecution delays unjustifiably

Justice delayed = corruption encouraged.

 

**PHASE 4 (Year 3–4): Fix Incentives (Not Morals)**

**7. Overpay Critical Decision Roles**

Unpopular but necessary.

Roles:

* Tax officers
* Customs officials
* Police investigators
* Procurement officers
* Regulators

Pay **2–3× market median**, but:

* Zero tolerance
* First offense = lifetime ban + asset seizure
* Appeals allowed only on law, not facts

High reward + high certainty of punishment beats sermons.

 

**8. Legalize & Cap Lobbying**

Influence exists whether we admit it or not.

* Legalize lobbying
* Mandatory disclosure:

·          

* Who met whom
* When
* On what topic
* Cooling-off period before officials join private sector

You can’t eliminate influence—only force it into daylight.

 

**PHASE 5 (Year 4–5): Citizen-Driven Oversight at Scale**

**9. Whistleblower Market**

* Verified corruption tips rewarded with % of recovered money
* Anonymous, cryptographically protected
* Severe penalties for false reporting

Millions of watchdogs beat a few agencies.

 

**10. Open Data → AI Auditors**

Release structured datasets for:

* Procurement
* Transfers
* Clearances
* Tax assessments

Let citizens, universities, and startups build **corruption-detection models**.

When detection becomes cheap, corruption becomes expensive.

 

**What I Would NOT Do**

❌ Moral lectures  
❌ Symbolic arrests  
❌ Selective raids  
❌ “Strong leader” theatrics  
❌ Assume culture changes first

Culture follows incentives—not the other way around.

 

**Realistic Outcomes (Not Utopian)**

* Retail corruption (basic services): ↓ 80–90%
* Mid-level bureaucratic corruption: ↓ 60–70%
* Grand corruption: harder, but slower & riskier
* Time to conviction: decades → months

Corruption won’t vanish—but it will stop being the dominant strategy.

 

**One-Line Summary**

**I wouldn’t try to make Indians honest.**  
**I’d redesign the system so dishonesty doesn’t pay.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1qbicgy/do_you_think_if_the_solution_proposed_can_make/

The Uncompromising Blissful Extravagance of His Presence! Inbox

By CMM.World CMMTheology.org - November 10, 2022

 Dear Mighty One,


I see the Lord's eye upon us we discover by revelation the 'new thing' He is doing in our lives and of those of us who, beyond the present darkness, gaze into His eyes. The 'tuning fork' of Yahweh is orchestrating the sons and daughters of our living God in growing holy remnant unity to withstand as we stand with Him fearlessly in the boldness of the faith of God in this hour. Egypt is behind us, and the covenantal promises and prophetic words we have received (1 Tim. 1:18) empower us by His Holy Spirit to advance in warfare, humbly growing in the spirit of wisdom and revelation. 


￼




Yesterday as I encouraged some friends, I said, 'stay in the blissful extravagance of His presence.'  Today I saw in Psalm 34 His eyes are upon us in vs. 8 & 9 and v:15 about the 'uncompromisingly righteous.'   We are to be holy as He is holy. That leaves no room for any more compromise or seeking to please man or the traditions of men, being free of the fear of man, the religious spirit, and any demonic activity.  We are seated in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. Lord, help us understand by revelation to walk in all the authority we have been given by Jesus Christ. 


Psalm 34:8-9 'O taste and see that the Lord [our God] is good! Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is the man who trusts and takes refuge in Him. O fear the Lord, you His saints [revere and worship Him]! For there is no want to those who truly revere and worship Him with godly fear.'

v. 15 'The eyes of the Lord are toward the [uncompromisingly] righteous and His ears are open to their cry.'

   Prophetic Encouragement for 2022                                                                        By Jorge Parrott (all scriptures NKJV)                                                                                     (Graphic art by Nancy G. Daniel)   Despite the impending wars, division, chaos, calamity, and deceptive controls we hear the voice of our Lord at times speaking, or roaring, or whispering, and breathing on the sons of God. Are we listening yet? Heaven’s roar is clear to those with an ear to hear what the Spirit of the Living God is saying. This year holds untold opportunities, many answered prayers, and the cries of many hearts if we arise to walk obediently in His fullness, not growing weary in well-doing, nor fainting in the heat of this fiery battle.   Deut. 6:4 ‘ The Lord our God, the Lord is one! 5 You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.’   Jesus was asked many questions.

￼

  Highlights Of Our Amazing Trip To The Holy Land  With Chris Reed  And Bart Peacher Prov. 16:9 ' A man’s mind plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps  and  makes them sure.' We are continually blessed and in awe of how the Lord breathes and moves in our lives. As we press into the high calling of Jesus Christ and we grow in intimacy and trust by faith, His love, grace, and mercy unfold in surprising ways. I had not been to Israel since 2017. So much has changed in the world since then as we see the tremendous acceleration of the times and seasons.   Chaos, control, and corruption are increasing at an alarming rate. Our only hope is in Jesus Christ and His righteousness.   Divine Encounters Abound As We Are Led By Holy Spirit And Make Ourselves Available   Many churches are led by their pursuit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the knowledge of the Tree of Life.  As we surrender fully to the Holy Spirit, we learn to walk in deep humility and attenti

THE REASON BJP CAME INTO POWER SINCE2014,1qb6mvu,0,0,2026-01-12 20:43:11,Physical-Pie706,IndiaTax,"Major Corruption Scandals and Allegations
Bofors Scandal (1980s-1990s): This major defense contract scandal involved allegations that top Indian politicians, including the then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and defense officials received kickbacks from Bofors AB, a Swedish arms manufacturer, to secure a deal for howitzer guns. The scale of the allegations led to the Congress party's defeat in the 1989 general elections.

2G Spectrum Scam (2008): Under the Congress-led UPA government, the allocation of 122 telecom licenses was declared ""unconstitutional and arbitrary"" by the Supreme Court in 2012, due to alleged irregularities in the ""first-come-first-served"" policy. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) estimated a presumptive loss of ₹1.76 lakh crore (approximately 1.76 trillion rupees) to the exchequer.

Coal Allocation Scam (""Coalgate"") (2004-2009): The CAG report alleged that the ad hoc allocation of 194 coal blocks to public and private enterprises resulted in a massive presumptive loss to the government. A special CBI court later convicted several individuals, including a former coal secretary, in connection with the case.

Commonwealth Games (CWG) Scandal (2010): Allegations of misappropriation of funds, over-inflated prices for equipment, and discrepancies in tender processes during preparations for the Commonwealth Games were raised. Suresh Kalmadi, the chairman of the organizing committee, was arrested and later absolved of all charges.

Adarsh Housing Society Scam (2012): This scandal involved the alleged allocation of flats, originally intended for war widows and defence personnel, to ineligible officials and politicians at below-market rates in a posh Mumbai building. Allegations were made against several former chief ministers of Maharashtra.

Harshad Mehta & Ketan Parekh Stock Market Scams (1990s-early 2000s): These large-scale stock market manipulation cases occurred during the Congress rule and, while primarily corporate fraud, highlighted systemic vulnerabilities and alleged support from some officials.

LIC-Mundhra Scam (1957): This was the first major financial scandal in post-independence India, involving the use of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) funds to bail out a private company owned by businessman Haridas Mundhra.

Fodder Scam (Bihar): A long-running fraud involving the fabrication of fictitious livestock and procurement of non-existent fodder and medicine, which spanned multiple years and involved politicians across different parties, including the Congress at various times.
National Herald Case: An ongoing case involving top Congress leaders and allegations of financial irregularities in the acquisition of assets of the Associated Journals Limited ",https://i.redd.it/m18quziuczcg1.jpeg
Mahanagarpalika elections- one message to the Reddit voters.,1qb3kjm,2,2,2026-01-12 18:52:56,_Dr_heiSenbeRG_,Maharashtra,"Please correct me if I am wrong here. 

Every day, urban reddit janta posts about clean streets, wide footpaths, public spaces, and “modern city vibes.” They complain online about corruption, looters, and politicians failing the city. They share memes about how the country is doomed because 'gavthi/chhapri' mindset lacks civic sense. 

But here’s the truth: these curated aesthetics mean nothing if the city ignores the very people keeping it running.

The backbone of every mahanagarpalika is blue-collar labor-  maids, drivers, construction workers, plumbers, garbage collectors, delivery boys, security guards. Most of them who are the same 'gavthi' people we complain about. Without them, offices, homes, malls, and public spaces literally stop functioning. And trust me, their number in your city is a lot bigger than we can imagine.

Yet these workers are often pushed to slums or outskirts with minimal civic facilities with low wages, denied proper housing, healthcare/education, even excluded from the city’s aesthetic life

This marginalization has a consequence far beyond their daily struggle:

They are trapped in underdeveloped, neglected areas with little hope of improving their quality of life, grow up in an environment where having 'civic sense' itself is a challenge, which in turn reflects their behaviour when they step out into the city. 

They often vote based on identity politics.. mostly caste, language, and religion, rather than urban development or governance. It’s not always about manipulation; it’s a rational response to a system that ignores their basic needs. Politicians exploit this, offering short-term benefits or symbolic gestures, keeping the cycle alive.

Meanwhile, nagarsevaks and corporators rarely invest in real urban integration. Election campaigns cater largely to vote banks rather than sustainable civic planning. Home prices are inflated so they have no choice but to stay in slums/ far away from the city. 

The irony?  Many of you have influence, resources, and voice, yet I see people focus on Instagram-worthy improvements instead of demanding equitable policies, fair wages, housing, and integration for blue-collar workers. How many of you asked your उमेदवार about their party's plan to deal with sky high property rates? What was their response?

Real progress isn’t pretty gardens or cycle lanes. it’s about inclusive urban planning that makes the workforce part of the city, not its periphery.

I looked up how development happened in Singapore, Tokyo, Copenhagen.. their efficiency and livability come not from aesthetics alone, but from integrating all workers into the system, providing housing, transport, and civic services. Which started with affordable housing. India’s cities could learn from this, but only if the white-collar population uses its influence to uplift, not just decorate, the city.

Until then, Mahanagarpalikas will remain a façade of development: Instagrammable parks, art installations, and clean roads, built on a marginalized workforce that has no real stake in the city they sustain.

If you’re part of the urban elite complaining online about corruption and poor governance, here’s the harsh truth: your city won’t improve until you ask for the inclusion and upliftment of those who keep it running. Otherwise, the cycle of neglect and identity-based politics will continue, and no aesthetic upgrade or I ❤️[city name]  will fix that🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/Maharashtra/comments/1qb3kjm/mahanagarpalika_elections_one_message_to_the/
There is no rule of law in India,1qaza1b,0,6,2026-01-12 16:20:12,fool49,Anarchy4Everyone,"India is more anarchic than USA or China. Among the three countries with the largest populations, India is most lawless. The legal system is understaffed and corrupt. Thus we don't want a rule of law. When the same laws are not objectively applied to everyone.

Therefore unfortunately people take the law into their hands. Like the authorities work with the local community to enforce their rules. This is also not acceptable. When different rules are applied to different people, and the rules are kept secret, and are not stable.

How can anarchy solve these problems? Can we use force to defend ourselves? Can we follow the rule: where you do unto others, what they do unto you?

Silliguri: Next Metro City of WB after Kolkata,1qaxu0i,3,10,2026-01-12 15:27:28,agnibhdatta,kolkata,"Kolkata as much as I know is one of the oldest modern cities of India and also one of the oldest mtero tier 1 city and business hub... Not to remind, today it's one of the most backdated, economically unstable, and corrupted city but still when I think of it, there's still the opportunity to get it back on it's feet so that it can atleast start competing with the other metro cities instead of getting pushed decades back... If today we had a nice leader and a fine reliable atleast government, this comes to my mind that we may would be seeing other tier 2 cities growing like Silliguri, Asansol, Durgapur, Bardhaman, Kharagpur, instead of Kolkata only having all the sweets from their's own region earned money as well...And not not to mention Silliguri, Asansol, and Durgapur are the second biggest cities after Kolkata, even tho, they are are tier 2... So if the state's condition was not like today's with a fine tolerable state government or even if in the future we get to see such a change in the state's goverment, law, ideas, innovations, will we be seeing Silliguri as the next metropoliatn city after Kolkata with a rise in infrastructure development, carrier fields, transport, facilities, and all major aspects that today's Indian metro cities have?",https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1qaxu0i/silliguri_next_metro_city_of_wb_after_kolkata/

* 0: A very minor threat that is easy to overcome
* 1: A fair fight that makes things interesting
* 2: A difficult situation that requires some outside the box thinking
* 3: A highly difficult situation requiring lots of micro-management, unit-countering and precise timing
* 4: A constant struggle in which focus and momentum must be maintained at all times, as well as proper tactics and timing
* 5: Nearly impossible. Every move must be flawless or aggressive save-scumming is necessary to win

**Rajendra: (red)**

**4.** 	**Sacred Waters: Difficulty 2**

1. **General Araiyan (orange), Vengi (purple), Local Villages (grey), Kalinga (teal), Utkala (green), Mahipala (yellow), Bandits (dark blue)**
2. This mission is a bit unlike any other I’ve played, but bears similarities to a few. I lost my first couple attempts, but my last was successful. I never did explore the full map, but looking at a guide shows the entire northwestern quarter is inaccessible, and the southeastern quarter is water. The player begins with a massive army of castle age soldiers and a mounted hero in the allied southwestern town of Vengi. The player needs to reach General Araiyan, who has a war camp waiting in the northeast, just before the edge of the map. The main enemy here is Mahipala, who immediately begins construction of a wonder just beyond the general, forcing the mission on a time crunch (and he builds it rather quickly). Between the player are 2 hostile cities with walls, towers, castles and garrisons, as well as bandits, hostile villages with small militias and raidable buildings and some Kalinga forces to the north. The player also has a fleet, though the water running up the map is heavily fortified by dozens of enemy ships and many towers dotting the map.
3. The settlements before the player can be conquered by killing the soldiers inside. The first is Kalinga, which has fewer soldiers and converts to the general’s control when conquered. After capturing it, its king will flee to a fortress in the northwest where soldiers will train and attempt to recapture it. When captured, all military buildings inside belong to the player, but they are reverted to a non-hostile to the enemy faction once the player leaves, and all production stops. This means the only way to maintain control of a town (including Vengi) is to have the original mounted hero within its walls at all times. After Kalinga is Utkala, which has more significant defenses and more soldiers, though it cannot be reconquered (I think). If the player kills the king of Kalinga and conquers Utkala, each will give regular tributes to the player for the rest of the game. Additionally, there are docks at each town, and the player occasionally gets a trade barge at the southwestern edge of the river that can tribute significant resources if brought to a dock. This is valuable, since it is a constant source of resources in a scenario where the player has no villagers or economy. There is also a special feature of this scenario where the player can enter a taunt and heal units significantly at the cost of food, though it cannot be spammed.
4. I started the game by holding position in Vengi and researching the armored elephant, halberdier, champion and elite elephant archer researches. I intended to leave the water alone, since I learned it was somewhat pointless in prior attempts, and instead rode out to attack Kalinga. Our archers drew their forces into our infantry and massacred them, bringing the city under allied control with ease. Our forces then marched northwest, eliminating a camp under Kalinga control before marching on the fortress. I lost a few men charging under castle fire, but I killed the king of Kalinga which forced the remaining soldiers and buildings into submission. I had learned from previous attempts that he must be beaten if the player wants any real chance of victory here, else Kalinga will constantly fall and the player’s flank will come under significant attack. My forces returned to Kalinga and prepared to attack Utkala while healing and training some more soldiers. I also purchased the elite urumi swordsmen upgrade as well since I had quite a few of them, though I never train them.
5. Our fleet was completely destroyed during this period, though I’d occasionally send my hero back to Vengi to regain control of a dock and claim cargo ships. This method meant I didn’t need to clear the water, though I couldn’t use conquered cities as conveniently. Fortunately I didn’t need to, since our strategy for Utkala worked flawlessly. The game implied there may be a better way to attack the city in the northern jungle, but prior attempts revealed nothing and I didn’t feel like scouting. Instead, my siege elephants attacked the gate while archers covered them. We were under heavy fire, but the armor proved sufficient and our troops steadily massacred the numerous defenders, eventually felling the last of them and forcing Utkala into submission as well. They asked for my help recovering a relic from bandits in the north, but I hadn’t done it before and didn’t know the territory, so I ignored it and rendezvoused with the general. He gave me control of another large army, permanent command of his dock and military buildings and revealed the main threat of the game.
6. Ahead of me was the fortress of Mahipala. It had lines of walls and towers, though there were no gates to keep us out. Significant economic activity dominated the flanks while castles stood directly down the center, north and south, surrounded by towers and military buildings. The wonder was behind walls and the central castle at the edge of the map, and all was defended by hundreds of diverse Mahipala soldiers who would constantly train from the many buildings. The enemy army would attack in five minutes, giving me that much time to prepare. I trained a few dozen more battle elephants, elephant archers, arbalests and halberdiers to round out our army (I lost the first attempt and knew I needed more soldiers). I kept my original hero in Vengi for this portion of the game to capture future cargo ships, since Mahipala vessels patrolled the area to sink them on spawning.
7. The enemy army attacked before long, and the battle was extremely fierce. Their many ranged soldiers felled our infantry quickly, but I had a reserve force of elephants and halberdiers that charged into their arbalests and elephant archers, scattering them from formation. While we worked to clean them up, my 20 or so siege elephants marched on the central castle. We suffered losses following them, but more soldiers trained and rendezvoused on the battlefield, keeping our numbers up in the back. The enemy castle fell in moments, and archers picked off those who pursued my siege elephants as they marched towards the water. Villagers from the nearby farms poured into the castle and towers but their arrows were meaningless, and that castle too fell in seconds. I had a few more siege elephants and many more battle and archer elephants in the back, and they headed for the northern castle with the others a few seconds behind. Our troops moved up with the siege cavalry, shrugging off enemy attacks and bringing the final castle down in seconds. The enemy surrendered and I claimed a hard fought victory.
8. This mission is a properly timed one, giving the player enough time to carry out significant side work while also having a very real timer. I got the sense it can be approached in many different ways, though having to move the hero back and forth is a frustrating design choice. The final battle is massive and savage, forcing the player to use proper tactics and capitalize on temporary advantage or risk being overrun. The enemy having a strong economy while the player lacks one is a two-edged sword, since the player could target that instead of the enemy castles and grind their army to a halt. I intend to return to this mission in the future for the achievement, though I have no idea how I’m going to get it. I suppose I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.

**5.** 	**Slaying the Vritra: Difficulty 3**

1. **The Chola Navy (green), Suryavarman (teal), Local Villages (grey), Srivijaya (dark blue), Sailendra (purple), Tambralinga (orange)**
2. This is a mission of conquest in its purest form. Like Sri Lanka, this mission takes place on an island surrounded by water. The south and north are mostly uninhabited, though there are smaller islands with docks, towers and workers belonging to Srivijaya occasionally. The central portion of the map is the main battleground, almost universally held by Sailendra. This formidable enemy has 6 castles and 7 local villages under his control, each of which can be conquered by damaging the towers or castles which places them under player control (they can be recaptured the same way). To win, the player simply needs to conquer all 6 castles, and the enemy is unprepared for invasion. In the far east is Sailendra, a part of Srivijaya that trains colossal fleets with dozens/hundreds of warships that will begin sailing before too long. Reaching them is not easy nor required, though it will likely help cut off the supply of help going to Srivijaya. The enemy is receiving resources through the local villages, and conquering them will also cut off those supplies.
3. The player has a few allies in this map in the form of the Chola navy and Suryavarman. Suryavarman has a small fortress on an island northwest of the main island, though he is locked in conflict with Tambralinga, a minor power that can be conquered by damaging his castle. Should this battle be ended in favor of Suryavarman, his soldiers will help the player conquer the one Srivijaya castle on his island, though they are otherwise useless. The Chola navy starts with a massive force of ships in the west with the player, and will go wherever the player commands to engage the enemy. They will occasionally send fleets to help, but cannot be relied on fully.
4. I started by issuing orders to my navy to engage the enemy harbor while I landed on the northwestern coast. A small harbor fortress and village were there, so my starting army in transport invaded and conquered both with ease. I knew we couldn’t dilly dally, so I took my navy and sent them to face the enormous fleet of Srivijaya in the straight between the two main islands while my army marched east and my villagers built a town center and created a strong economy (the player has a few villagers on a transport). We found an enemy army camp blocking the way, but we easily punched through it and headed south, conquering another castle. I sent in a few villagers to start producing there while heading north and seizing another village, and that was when I saw Sailendra for the first time. Their enormous fleet noticed our newly conquered keep and opened fire, but that was a mistake. I sent some arbalests inside and had everyone else retreat, and we steadily demolished the fleet before moving on. We conquered another enemy camp and several more villages along the northern coast while the Chola navy finished the enemy ships and moved with us, but that was where things stalled.
5. I had constructed a small navy in the south to dispatch the enemy harbors off shore, but Sailendra elected to attack here rather than the north. His newly constructed fleet savaged the harbors on the southern shore before sailing for my castel, holding it down for quite some time. Srivijaya had also finished his preparations for the war machine, and his soldiers poured out of the next castle like water while his fleet attacked from the sea. Our soldiers were suffering losses rapidly, but we held out until the navy reinforced our position and pushed forward, capturing the castle at the loss of most of our men. What followed was a savage battle that lasted for 20-30 minutes, where my limited army and whatever I could train tried desperately to survive against the onslaught of soldiers from the last castle across the water. Endless enemy ships from both factions swarmed us, and I knew it was only a matter of time before we lost our foothold.
6. In this time, the Chola navy had successfully cleared the coast of the smaller island to the northwest, and I built a few cannon galleons to capitalize on this. They bombarded the enemy castles on it, wiping out Tambralinga and seizing the territory of Srivijaya, though the many soldiers produced there razed most of the settlement. This victory seemed to slow the enemy down, and we gradually made headway on the opposing fleet while a few villagers arrived to construct more monasteries, towers and military buildings. The tide truly turned when the next wave of Sailendra ships headed to my western castle instead of the northern one, giving me the time I needed to finish their ships. The Chola navy reinforced me with another wave after that, pushing the enemy back to their last major section of harbors.
7. I capitalized on this strike, and collected a strike team I had intended to use on the northwestern island that had seen no action yet. These troops sailed near the final castle and landed, punching through a wall and charging inside while most enemy soldiers were busy fighting my castle and garrison. We captured the final fortification, forcing Srivijaya to surrender and giving me my final victory.
8. This mission is a brutal fight, and one I probably made harder on myself than it needed to be. I’ve read Suryavarman is a helpful ally, so I probably just freed him too late to make a big difference which slowed everything down. The villages were undoubtedly contributing to the endless waves of enemy soldiers, and it probably would’ve been smart to send a small attack force to clear them all while the larger battle was going on. I also could’ve focused more on Sailendra, but I get the feeling it’s harder to destroy them than it is to finish the scenario’s main enemy, so I probably made a smart move avoiding them. Overall, I think this is a well designed conquest scenario, and I like the grand scale it holds, even if it’s a bit unfair to have computers managing the whole thing at once while I’m stuck in one place at a time. The Chola navy is a boon here, and it would be miserable if their waves weren’t as large as they are.

This campaign definitely took things up a notch, but was well-made and engaging the whole way through. I’m left feeling a bit unsatisfied from a few missions, but only because the victory conditions ended things before I could explore entire maps and deal with all factions in some cases. The Dravidians are definitely a fun civ to play, but I was correct in my initial assumption that I wouldn’t like using their urumi swordsmen, though I do like their powerful warship and elephant regeneration. I have only the Hindustani campaign left in India, and it’s bittersweet. I’ve enjoyed these so far, but I’ll be on to my last region of the world once that one is over. I should be sure to enjoy whatever’s left.

Rajendra Review Part 1,1qbqxlc,0,1,2026-01-13 13:12:10,Flimsy_Tomato_2538,aoe2,"**Difficulty Ratings**

* 0: A very minor threat that is easy to overcome
* 1: A fair fight that makes things interesting
* 2: A difficult situation that requires some outside the box thinking
* 3: A highly difficult situation requiring lots of micro-management, unit-countering and precise timing
* 4: A constant struggle in which focus and momentum must be maintained at all times, as well as proper tactics and timing
* 5: Nearly impossible. Every move must be flawless or aggressive save-scumming is necessary to win

**Rajendra: (red)**

This campaign is focused on the Dravidians, who I learned from the last one have strong and regenerating elephants. I also know they have the strange, mulit-hit unique infantry that strike in a circle, though I’ve never really used charged units in the past. Like the last campaign, I don’t have much experience with them, but I’m looking forward to changing that.

1. **The Successor: Difficulty 2**
   1. **Vengi (purple), Local Villages (grey), The Chola Army (green), Kerala (yellow), The Chalukyan Army (dark blue), Manyakheta (teal), Chalukyan Garrisons (orange)**
   2. This mission is an interesting one, with quite a few moving parts, though it eventually turns into a slugfest. The player starts in the southeast with 2 mounted heroes and a force of light cavalry. The soldiers must scout for around 5 minutes to try and weaken the enemy army, though they won’t be able to do much. I rode south and killed a few members of the enemy garrison before making contact with the ruined town of Kerala in the corner. They promised to aid me if I constructed 4 military buildings within their town. I then rode north and discovered a local town with a tower and a few garrison soldiers inside. I was given the option of razing their mill for plunder or rescuing them for future tribute, and chose the latter. We discovered the main Chalukyan army camp just west of there, in the center of the map, with a fortress guarded by a castle to the east. We also discovered a small path that led to elephant enclosures for the enemy, and a single rider made it inside and burned the palisade, preventing them from training elephants for a time.
   3. It was after this that a group of villagers arrived and I received a few hundred resources to start. I was also alerted to my ally in the eastern corner, the town of Vengi, who would send soldiers to fight the enemy every so often and had a market for trade. My main goal was twofold; defeat the Chalukyan army entirely and destroy the 4 universities of Manyakheta, the imperial age city to the north. Manyakheta had a small economy and occasionally sent small parties of strong raiders, but mostly kept to themselves. The Chalukyan army had a strong economy in the center, guarded by towers, many military buildings and a castle, though their soldiers were in the castle age. Both Vengi and I were in the feudal age, and none of us could advance to the imperial in this scenario. I located the other 5 villages supplying food to the enemy, but couldn’t reach the 4 in the west without going through a small camp belonging to the army that blocked the southwestern pass. We were, however, able to ride through Vengi and up north, killing the guards of a town between the enemy capital and their fortress.
   4. I had secured a few villages before the enemy raiders came. I was unprepared, and found myself outnumbered and rapidly slaughtered, forcing a reload. This time I put all villagers on food and stone, with a few on gold. Within just a few minutes I had reached the castle age, constructed a castle and researched murder holes. This castle protected us from the initial enemy raids, and let us survive in relative comfort. I received tribute from the locals a few times before the enemy decided to end them entirely. The garrisons massacred the villagers and burned the mills in the west, and a group of riders slaughtered the villages I had already liberated. Fortunately, Vengi was not slacking, and they soon reached the castle age, constructed a siege workshop and stormed the eastern fort, destroying it and replacing it with one of their own.
   5. I focused on advancing and defending myself while also constructing buildings for Kerala. The game warned me they would be fickle, so I only gave them archery ranges and barracks. They started training long swordsmen and crossbowmen who mostly fought over the southern pass, but helped occupy enemy soldiers and damaged the towers there. I fended off wave after wave of enemy soldiers, eventually growing my fortifications to 3 castles that faced no real threat since the enemy didn’t use siege weapons. I had soon finished all the upgrades I needed, and trained a large army of pikemen, battle elephants, elephant archers, monks and armored elephants. My army struck out swiftly, destroying the southern camp and pushing into the west to avenge the villages and annihilate the garrison. My allies converged on the army’s southern flank while I hit the southwest, killing their units and surrounding their military buildings while my armored elephants tore down the towers and made for the castle. After the castle fell, we moved on to the enemy town centers, with elephant archers behind to kill any fleeing villagers. They surrendered as their buildings fell to dust, and then some things changed.
   6. We received news of our leader's death, prompting one of our heroes to leave. This was seen as weakness by Kerala, who declared war on us immediately. I trained a small force of battle, archer and armored elephants who reclaimed the buildings we had constructed for them and destroyed their town center, wiping them out in mere minutes. I dispatched Vengi to hit Manyakheta’s eastern farms while I attacked their economy center in the west, quickly pushing them into the city. They had a castle guarding the southwestern wall, so my armored elephants ripped it apart while my ally pushed up to the gate. We had made multiple entrances and destroyed 2 universities before long, finishing off the castle and most towers and breaching the city. My elephants charged the town center while my soldiers worked down the military buildings and ever training units, eventually leaving them with no defense. A few monks behind a locked gate in the corner tried to convert us, but my archers killed them as we finished the last towers and universities, conquering the capital and winning us the scenario.
   7. This mission earned its difficulty rating because of the start. I expected Vengi to draw enemy fire, but they were never even attacked once. All raids came to me, who started with few resources in the feudal age, which meant I needed proper protection fast. Once the castles were up, it was just a matter of building up the resources to upgrade and train an army, which was then unstoppable. Kerala betraying me wasn’t a big surprise, and they were easily beaten, and I didn’t mind the enemy destroying the villages since it makes sense, but I didn’t like the lack of a way to reach the western villages without making significant progress against the army. These are minor nitpicks, since this is a pretty solid battle scenario that accomplishes what it intends quite nicely.
2. **Deeds of the Father: Difficulty 2**
   1. **Chola Forces (green), Local Villages (grey), Mannaram (yellow), Polonnaruwa (purple), Ruhuna (orange), King Mahinda (dark blue)**
   2. This mission is based on the island of Sri Lanka, and is surrounded by lots of mostly empty water (fish are only near the coast). The player starts with just a few ships, including transports with almost a dozen men, in the northeastern corner. Around them is a raging naval battle, with the Chola forces holding back ships belonging to Mahinda, the leader of the enemy. Upon landing at the docks of a small village on the shore, the player is given command of around 10 crossbowmen and pikemen, along with some urumi swordsmen and light cavalry from the transports. There is also an armored elephant and a mounted hero, though the elephant should be kept back (a mistake I made that caused me to restart the mission after a few minutes). The Chola towers around the village will help the player, but it is these starting troops that must hold back three sizable waves belonging to Mahinda that will attack from the southwest and south. After defeating them, the player gains control of the village and the fleet outside, as well as almost a thousand gold, food and wood. Unfortunately, there is no town center and no villagers, and the player is in the castle age to boot.
   3. In order to make real progress, the player must conquer one of the larger nearby villages. To the southeast is Polonnaruwa, a town with docks on the eastern shore and a castle and tower guarding its northern approach. To the southwest is Mannaram, a long and thin village with 4 towers scattered about its length, and no docks despite it being on the coast. Both towns have significant gold, wood and food within them, and all units, buildings, resources and villagers in a town will join the player if it is subdued. Subduing Polonnaruwa requires the destruction of the castle, while Mannaram only needs its towers to fall. Completing either objective gives the player the option of sacking the town center or capturing it by bringing the hero close. Sacking a town center gives no people or buildings (I think), but does give many resources and a free castle age advancement. Between the player and these villages, and one south of Mannaram, are 4 local villages that are held by 4 of Mahinda’s soldiers with a guard tower, and can be liberated by clearing these soldiers without destroying a building. Liberating a village will cause it to give significant resources (hundreds) of a specific type at long intervals for the rest of the game, or the buildings can be sacked for resources quickly.
   4. The player must conquer both of the main villages to progress, and both will train armies (and a small navy in Polonnaruwa’s case) to raid the player, though their soldiers aren’t particularly strong. The main foe here is Ruhuna, the massive faction that dominates the entire southern section of the map. They can only be approached through one of the two sides of the map, since the middle is cliffs, jungle and ridges, and a gate blocks the left while castles guard both. Ruhuna trains a diverse fleet from docks in the south and west, and its towers guard the southern waters alongside ships. Their economy is massive and sprawling, with multiple town centers, and they train imperial age infantry, urumi swordsmen, elephant archers and siege elephants to attack the player if left to themselves.
   5. I started the mission on my successful attempt by ignoring the water and focusing on the land. I used infantry and archers exclusively to deal with the enemy attackers, and lost few soldiers while keeping my armored elephant unharmed. I used my resources to buy a few blacksmith upgrades, as well as arson, and trained a few archers and skirmishers to reach my population limit. We liberated the fishing village to our west and marched south towards Mannaram. The village had a large garrison, but our archers steadily massacred its soldiers while the elephant and our melee troops focused on the towers. It was painful, but we had captured the town before long, and immediately gained access to a massive economy and enough food for an immediate castle age research (though it wasn’t free or instant). I received some reinforcements 3 times at the northern dock in the form of a few warships, an armored elephant and some infantry or archers in a transport. I pooled these soldiers with my army and we marched for the 2 villages north of Polonnaruwa while my scout cavalry searched for nearby sources of stone.
   6. We discovered the ancient ruins of a city just east of our village, with 3 stone mines inside. I immediately dispatched villagers to search it while our men found several groups of soldiers to join us around the map and cleared the villages. We retreated to the base, withstood a few soldiers from our 2 enemies and liberated the final village. The game expressed concern over the enemies sacking the villages, and I expected it given the last mission, but that didn’t happen. Instead, we constructed our first castle as the enemy ships assaulted our coast, barely giving us the means to hold them off for the rest of the game. Our northern shore saw several attacks from enemy ships, but the many towers and mighty warships we were given proved more than enough to hold the line. I healed my men using new monks, purchased important researches with my many resources (lots from the villages) and marched on Polonnaruwa with my army. We faced down the many soldiers of its garrison, but we proved more than capable of winning the battle, and I soon had the town under my control after losing very few soldiers.
   7. I thought we had things in the bag as our objective shifted to its final faze. In the south of Ruhuna was a fortress, surrounded by enemy military buildings, towers and just above the docks. Inside were some infantry, towers and a castle with King Mahinda inside. I needed to force him out and mortally injure him to win, but this would mean fighting through the heart of Ruhuna. I figured it wouldn’t be so bad, especially because of the many villagers we gained from our conquest, but I was wrong. We were soon under attack by dozens and dozens of enemy soldiers from the south, and my army was rapidly losing. I took the many villagers I had recently acquired and set them to building a castle in the battle zone. They finished and it led to our victory, though enemy ships had leveled the docks and destroyed my captured ships, and my entire army save armored elephants, monks and my hero were killed. I started training pikemen, elephant archers and armored elephants to make up what was lost, and saw the number of enemy soldiers slow significantly.
   8. We then gained a new side objective to destroy another fortress belonging to King Mahinda atop a ridge in the northern edges of Ruhuna. We pressed into their territory, destroying the first castle before us and leveling their farms and many military buildings before tearing west. We found the fortress and assaulted it, tearing it to pieces with ease as our elephant archers proved unmatched, and destroying the castle and buildings inside. We recovered a relic cart, permanently reducing the enemy attack by significant numbers and halting their elephant training. These restrictions left them with only a few infantry and ships to build, so I sent my warships to scout the waters and destroy the western docks, prompting most of their fleet to retaliate. We won in the water, and soon had our fleet poised to move south once we dealt with the towers.
   9. Our soldiers marched west and cut down, destroying any building that stood in our way and soon reaching the docks. Dozens of enemy ships fired on our mighty elephants, but our archers destroyed them, one after another, while the armored elephants ripped apart the docks and towers. We soon cleared the entire coast, cutting back upwards in the east to finish their last town center. Ruhuna surrendered, leaving only Mahinda and his fortress. Our elephants obliterated his gate without issue and his men fell swiftly, the castle collapsing moments after. Mahinda was subdued upon being exposed, and the mission ended with a decisive victory.
   10. I thought this mission would be harder than it was, but Dravidian elephant archers are incredibly powerful. The few I started with made short work of most enemies we faced early, and raids on the starting village were infrequent enough that we only had to deal with 1 or 2 before collecting enough stone for a castle. I figured it would get rid of the villagers once I took a faction, but letting me keep them and the resources made jumpstarting very easy. Add to this that my fishing ships never faced a threat (thanks to the towers) and the local villagers were never attacked and I had more than enough resources very fast. Ruhuna seemed threatening with their massive army, but only a few enemies filtered in at a time after that, and they were easy to tear apart. I’ve come to a conclusion having played a few scenarios with Indian civs; elephant archers are lots of fun.
3. **Rising Star: Difficulty 3**
   1. **The Chola Empire (grey), Vengi (purple), Sri Lanka (orange), Madurai (yellow), Srivijaya (dark blue), Bengali Pirates (green), The Chalukyan Empire (teal)**
   2. This was one of the most chaotic missions I’ve played yet. It begins in the east, with the player in control of a transport and just a few warships at a port in the corner. The player is given an envoy, a hero trade cart and a few soldiers, and must sail to the center of the map. The map is zoomed out, and encompasses all of southern India, with Sri Lanka as a large island just off the south coast and a few islands in the eastern Bay of Bengal. The largest island, in the center of the bay, has a castle and many docks belonging to the Bengali pirates. These pirates also had a few docks southeast of the castle, and several in the swamps directly north. All of these areas had towers and archery ranges to train raiders that would land at Sri Lanka. The player must ensure the transport carrying the envoy and trade cart survive the journey to the center, with only a few advantages on the journey. To make matters worse, sailing through the bay itself is hazardous, and will rapidly damage player ships. I barely made it through, losing all of my ships but the transport which landed at the palace. Landing here removed the heroes and gave me control of the Chola empire forces.
   3. My holdings were 3 main bases belonging to me. In the center of the map, on India’s eastern coast were a few docks, a town center and some military and economy buildings. North of this base was another village, much smaller, but with some nearby stone and farms. Across the hills and forests to the west was a small village with only a few houses, mills and a barracks on the coast. All of these had villagers, some more than others, and I had access to a few guards at each point, though nothing crazy. I was given 3 war galleys and 3 fire ships, and started in the castle age, unable to age up. I also had 2 main allies, Vengi, north of my northern village, which had a walled city that trained soldiers to attack wherever I flared on the map, and Sri Lanka, who mostly fought pirates unsuccessfully. My mission was to acquire 10 prestige, and this is where things get complicated.
   4. I had castles in both Vengi and Sri Lanka. If either fell to 1000 HP, they would be captured by the enemy and that faction would revolt against me. As it stood, I had prestige for the both of them under my control. The kingdom of Madurai had a small walled city just southwest of my main town, and could be conquered by damaging their castle to the same extent (though the game warned me they were fickle and untrustworthy). My primary enemies were to the north, in the form of the Chalukyan Empire. The Chalukyans had two towns, one in the northeast and another in the northwest, with military buildings in both. There were 4 castles guarding their land, 3 in the east and one in the west, that would eventually train trebuchets. They also had docks in the west, several on the Indian coast and 4 others, guarded by towers in the corner of the map. Lastly was a relic, the only one on the map, within a monastery in between the two halves of the empire. They had plenty of resources to hold out for a long time, and could field massive armies in moments. All 3 of my main enemies here, the Chalukyans, pirates and Madurai, all built ships and attacked coasts wherever they could.
   5. It wasn’t long after I gained control of my empire that I was given ways to increase my prestige. I was told to construct a castle on a deserted half of the main pirate island, which would prevent them from spawning free ships at the edge of the eastern coasts. I was contacted by Srivijaya, who was open to trading with me using their docks on a small island against the southeastern edge. They had a mighty military there, and offered a prestige if I traded with them 100 times. I ignored them the whole game, since I had no time or resources to devote to the sea with so much happening on land. I was able to receive prestige points for destroying the 4 docks in the western corner of the map, capturing the relic and wiping out the Chalukyans entirely. I could also build a castle just north of my western base to hold the river, and maintain a fleet of 40 warships to gain another point. All in all, there was much to do, and I couldn’t advance to the imperial age until I had 5 points.
   6. I spent most of the early game fending off enemies, buying upgrades and building up forces, eventually driving the few Chalukyan towers and camps out of my territory and relegating them to the northern part of the river that divided the map. I constructed a castle on the coast of my main base, and 2 more in the western base to guard the coast and hold the river, giving me a point. I was training soldiers to conquer a Chalukyan castle and capture the relic, but decided Madurai was a more immediate threat and an easier foe to defeat. A few armored elephants, supported by battle elephants, elephant archers, monks and pikemen managed to breach the gates and storm the castle forcing Madurai to swear fealty to me. I was now able to reach the castle age, and immediately researched technologies to strengthen my fortifications which continuously suffered damage. Things were looking up for a bit, but then disaster struck.
   7. The Chalukyans (somehow) managed to inspire rebellion from both Madurai and Vengi, damaging both castles significantly. My mission shifted to simply destroying Madurai, and my troops had never left since I didn’t trust them. We wiped out their castle and quickly razed their town center, which caused them to surrender in minutes. I earned another prestige point and eliminated the faction completely. As for Vengi, I had apparently researched enough building upgrades that the castle had too many HP. Instead of being reduced to 1000, it still had 2500, so they remained under my control. It was now that the Chalukyans stepped up their game, launching attacks with imperial age soldiers, galleons and trebuchets to face me. I struggled to hold my ground for a time, but a single trebuchet, guarded by some cavalry and my castle, managed to bring down the enemy castle in the west, halting trebuchets there forever (though enemy soldiers still swarmed the castle regularly).
   8. The main fighting was taking place near Vengi, where enemy trebuchets constantly poured from across a bridge that was now repaired. My army from Madruai was still intact, and it received a few upgrades, reinforcements and some trebuchets to bring down the Chalukyan threat. We found 2 castles surrounded by military buildings in the northeast, and barely destroyed them before losing most of our army. My soldiers were dwindling, and I started building a new army with only elephant archers to hold the line. Vengi sent men to intercept enemy counterattacks, and I soon had enough soldiers to press on and destroy the town center and economic buildings. We swung around the north, leveling the last castle, capturing the relic and forcing them into the northwest. I thought I had them almost finished, but this is where things went south.
   9. The enemy still had a strong economy, and had constructed all the military buildings they needed in the northwestern town. Endless swarms of enemy soldiers poured towards our army, halting it in its tracks and whittling them down while monks converted us steadily. I had soon lost the entire army, and the enemy was now attacking my castle across the river. I trained another army nearby, and used the castle as a staging ground like before. Trebuchets fired across the river, destroying whatever buildings were in reach while my soldiers sheltered under the castle and steadily grew their numbers. I noticed the enemy numbers starting to wane, and we surged across the river to capitalize. Every military building we destroyed was quickly replaced by another, but the delay in construction bought us the time we needed, and the last town center was soon in range. Our trebuchets targeted and destroyed it, causing the entire empire to surrender and earning me another point.
   10. I now shifted my attention fully to the pirates, having upgraded my ships with a special technology so I no longer suffered damage in the bay. I trained galleons, elite cannon galleons and the unique Dravidian warship in large numbers, and my fleet surged into their territory like a plague of locusts. They managed to destroy quite a few of my ships, but I successfully eradicated every port and tower, though they still did not surrender. I constructed the castle on their island, halting their spawning ships and giving me the objective of destroying them. I had already destroyed them, so the castle gave me 2 prestige points and ended the game, since it was combined with my massive fleet. The mission ended before I managed to eliminate the western docks, but I had won regardless.
   11. This mission might not seem that hard from my description, but it was a long battle of attrition that kept me on my toes. The Chalukyans would adjust strategies, used a diverse military and had a strong enough economy to be a serious threat as long as they were alive. The pirates had enormous fleets of ships, but they focused on Sri Lanka which meant they weren’t much of a threat to me overall. Madurai was frustrating, and would’ve been a bigger problem if my armored elephants hadn’t been waiting outside their castle for a betrayal. I’m not a fan of the game arbitrarily deciding Vengi should betray me, but I’m glad an oversight let me keep them with some upgrades so I didn’t have to worry about it. I can’t imagine how difficult it would be to focus almost solely on the water, though I think there are enough prestige points in enemy docks and trading with Srivijaya (and the other objectives the guide tells me come after) to get the player to victory. All in all, this mission was brutal and had a grand strategy aspect with many paths to victory. It was both fun, and exhausting.

Waiting half a day for a game and its a remake - if one remake wasnt enough, wait another 15-30 minutes for another game and its remake again, **because the same exact player causes two remakes in a row**.  
Instead of having fun playing this game, im stuck in long af queue timers that lead into two remakes in a row caused by the same player. Good job Riot, im so glad i chose your product instead of literally anything else on the market. I swear those long q timers and constant remakes are so much better gaming than literally any other product on the market that doesnt force me to stay forever in Q in hopes of one game that will eventually be a dumb losersq no fun shitfest. **Good job Riot Meddler and other briliant game devs. That 2 days losersq streak really made me have a fun time like i never had in 10 years of playing this game. So glad that i chose to play League instead of doing literally anything else.**   
So happy knowing that my favorite game is in hands of developers that make everything in their power to make sure this product is fun and competitive.   
  
**Before you post dumb comment, saying 'who cares', or 'go play something else then', or 'Riot dont read Reddit rants'.**

I dont care about the opinion of other redditors here - i have a good reason to be posting my disregard for how this game is being handled, because im passionate about it and i wont allow Riot to treat me like that after years of being loyal to this game and paying unimaginable amount of money - noone asked me to, i know - but this type of effort should be met with atleast respectable treating. If you are the type of people that dont react when someone spits in your face and you call it raining - thats your business, but i wont stand for everything that goes on in this game. 

Riot should listen to players rants and fix whatever issues are making the game annoying.  
And no, they shouldnt listen to low elo 0 game knowledge players that whine about ADCs being bad - when ADCs, atleast on ARAMs, are the most disgusting and overbuffed class in the entire game. Listen to players that have the game knowledge and facts behind their reasoning.   
Sending a clip on the internet of your level 12 Caitlyn play against level 15 Malphite and you dont do any damage to him and thats your reasoning for calling ADCs weak - if you really think that early game, snowballing ADC like Caitlyn that has clearly fallen off and didnt maintain her lead, can walk up to armor stacking Malphite with 3 levels and item adventage, start autoing him and you expect that she kills him - this is the kind of delusional ADC ranting. The anime main character syndrome, where they think ADCs should be poke, assassins, carries, tanks and what else? Best at early game, mid game, late game, laning phase, 1v1s, splitpush, taking objectives?   
  
Riot are the ones who are making the game, but community is the reason why the game has a playerbase and why Riot employees have paychecks, so they are not entitled in any way to be handling the game like they are doing.  
**When there is new skin presented and it has the wrong shade of red** \- people start complaining and its immediately being fixed. **When issues like matchmaking, balance, behavioral system or losersq are actively ruining all the fun and competitivness out of this game, everyone seems to be sitting quiet**. Why would people rant about braindead champions when they are the ones that use them to gain LP that you otherwise wouldnt get with a regular, non broken champion that actually takes effort, skill and understanding of the game to be pulled off? What can most of you know about losersq when most of you are low elo, barely if ever carrying games 1v9? 

This community should have a sense of responsibility about the game we are all playing and rant when Riot spits on your faces. We are not mindless sheep that can allow Riot to spit on us, only because game is free to play - have some self respect. And Riot have some respect too - without players you wouldnt be a bilion dollar company.   
I can surely quit, but i wont quit before i lay down every annoying aspect of this game. Its a wishful thinking, but maybe somewhere in Riot office there is atleast one guy that is also passionate about this game and wants it to be fun and competitive for everyone. Or maybe community will finally start ranting about important issues, instead of ranting only when it comes to wrong shades of colors on new skins. 

Dont get me wrong - Riot is a great company full of so talented people - their music, arts, skins, cinematic teams and basically everyone who is not a part of balance, gameplay, behavioral system, etc. are amazing, talented human beings that deserve everything good in their lives. Thats why what gameplay side of Riot is doing sticks out like a sore thumb. They should meet the standards of people that work on non gameplay teams. 

  
**I dont queue up to play League of Legends to have disgusting, unfun and uncompetitive time**

Is it that crazy to ask game developers of this company to respect players efforts and time? I choose to play this game out of any possible product out there on the market and all i get for the past 2 days are only games that want to make me pull my hair out. 

I have played this game for a very long time, i have been patient with the most disgusting part of this game which is terrible balance that allows total npcs to take over games and statcheck players that are miles better than them and amount of champions that are game breaking is mind baffeling and that number keeps going up every year with each disgusting 0 skill, overloaded statcheck that you implement into the game, whether its reworking old champions, overbuffing old designs so they can keep up with obviously overloaded new designs, or adding new champions. 

No matter how mad i was every time i was statchecked with 0 counterplay by overloaded monstrosity of a champion or lost the game because of it, i kept on going, because it doesnt bother me to the point of wanting to quit as long as i can 1v9 most of the games im in and that brings me the most fun and urge to keep on playing more games. 

But with the current losersq streak that my main account is on for god only knows what reason (my winrate on that account doesnt reach some crazy number) for the first time in over a decade long League carrer i seriously feel disgusted at how this game matchmaking is treating me and im definitely gonna take a break from playing it, when the product is that unimaginably annoying. 

  
**Every single game is a struggle where im not allowed to simply chill and have fun. Im either sweating my balls off in order to 1v9 the game or i wont be able to even sniff a win, because unlike enemy teams that always play to win and tryhard, my teams are useless, ulting air, teleporting into 5 people alone and dying, while on enemy team everyone tries their best to win**

https://preview.redd.it/leq6z18za2dg1.jpg?width=401&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=653be4c87a1cbbb7e20bdd2da506157d4db6f2cd

I queue up to have 1-2 fun games and go on my business doing something else. Instead im stuck playing for hours in order to get one win and these wins dont happen if i dont literally 1v9 the game, despite my dog npc teammates or disgusting 0 counterplay enemy team comps filled with dumb champions.  


Why am i forced to 1v9, instead of having back of my team and collectively achieving win together? Why in all of these games there were players on enemy team that contribiuted little to nothing to win these games and they still win? And im out here sweating to carry my npc teams and every game is defeat. Answer is simple - disgusting losersq.

Lucian and Darius games were wins, because enemy team comps werent absolute 0 counterplay monstrosities and i was actually able to do something, but it doesnt change the fact that it was a losersq unfun struggle.  
Lucian game - we were literally tower defending our nexus for half a game.   
Darius game - when i was dead, so was my whole team. Without me and my 1v9 performance, they would have lost.  
Other games - no matter how good i played - npc useless team mates combined with impossible to play against enemy comps. Even if i absorbed souls of Chovy and Faker - it still wouldnt be enough to carry these games 1v9.  

**And before anyone says 'maybe youre just waiting to KS and thats how you get those KDAs'** you dont know how im playing, all i can post here are post game results that should tell you a lot, but there is much more to every League game than simply KDA and opgg scores - do you also need me to post every single game graph and prove to you that im top damage in every single game im in, even on non carry champions like immobile, rangeless Darius or full tank Thresh? 

**Another issue - why am i forced to 1v9 in order to win a game? Why is my team doing nothing?**

[ah yes, the known strategy of sitting back, waiting to KS 1 hp kills and somehow ending up with the most damage of your team](https://preview.redd.it/dfldlzdgm2dg1.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91617efd3373e1009a064812042c0126e37e60c7)

[full tank thresh doing more damage than 3 mages - surely it aint losersq ](https://preview.redd.it/h46jdmkxm2dg1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89dbf87a6755bf3b7a9ad6b88f19a64df704b064)

**Ah yes, im forced to 1v9, because my attack damage CARRY Caitlyn barely keeps up with full tank Rammus damage, meanwhile enemy ADC does 2-3 times more damage than my Caitlyn does.**   
**Im forced to 1v9, because my Caitlyn gets heavily outdamaged by Heartsteel bruiser Katarina.**   
**Every game enemy is literally Ruler and my ADC barely provides any damage.**  


  
**Every single game i have shown above, im the top damage on my team**  
What else do you need me to do? Take the remote control of every PC of my team and play for them?  
People on my team are picking ADCs and they are bad enough to get outdamaged on them by melee bruisers or full tanks that im playing. Why am i expected to 1v9 in order to get a single win and my teammates that pick carries arent expected to do their job and carry the game?

It should tell you all you need to know when **im top damage of my team on useless 0 range, 0 mobility Darius that gets CC chained and oneshot by enemy team if i take one bad step in a fight, or at the very least, im kited forever and unable to join the fight without flash/snowball or CC from my team. Meanwhile, my ADCs somehow all get outdamaged by that useless piece of outdated champion. Like how? All you need to do to outdamage Darius is poke enemy champions with range adventage that you have early game. I cant walk up to enemy champions early game if they are not melee - and these games enemy comps were all ranged champions that futtbuck Darius lack of range and mobility super well. I have to play pixel perfect in order to be able do anything - or i get kited, CC chained and oneshot. Literally unable to do anything if i dont find good windows throughout the game. Caitlyn just walks up with her huge range adventage to basically anyone and farms dmg output.**   
I mean, at the very least thats what regular, human Caitlyn player does. Npc walking bag of golds that you put in my games, they cant even do that. 

I know when to go in, i know my champions combo damage, limits and everything that i need to know in order to reach high KDAs and top damage in most games im in.    
**Why are my team mages and ADCs doing no damage? Enemy team ADCs go top damage, 20 kills and carry the game from minute 1 till nexus blows up. My ADCs are mindless npcs that dont do any damage and constantly get caught.** 

Try to be me in one of those games and try to win them when you are not allowed to even die to reset and buy items, because if you leave your npc team alone for a moment, they all find a way to die 4v5 (yes, because they are dumb enough to not understand that fighting in number disadventage, especially when all of them are behind enemy team **and your main damage source and most fed member is dead**, isnt the best strategy to win games) and when you finally respawn, your team is all dead and you are forced to defend nexus 1v5 - thats how my Nidalee game went, literally.

**Doesnt matter how many spears ive hit, how many enemy champions ive killed and how much damage i farmed from all the poke - npc team dies during last fight and im expected to 1v5 on non 1v5 champion in order to win the game.**   
Very fun and competitive, but can i maybe have a team for once?  


**There are more issues with losersq than i mentioned in previous losersq post**



For starters something that many ARAM regulars here should be familiar with, which is **matchmaking putting the same exact players in your games every single day for 365 days in a year**

https://preview.redd.it/ozarmu6tc2dg1.jpg?width=336&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d21ca8d7ece48c4dce8a3f4eddc74155bd57f8f2

This is the amount of players that have reappeared in my recent games - as you can correctly assume, i wasnt premade with any of them. Add to that amount of the same players on enemy teams that opgg doesnt track and you can come to a sad conclusion that the current matchmaking needs to be fixed ASAP, because it means that if you reach certain ARAM MMR youre forever stuck in a loop of the same types of players in your games, because ARAMs dont have rank system - its just some dumb matchmaking that noone knows how it operates. You cant win 20 games in a row and go from lets say platinum to masters. ARAM MMR doesnt reset every season like it should - better yet, i would propose it refreshes much sooner than once a season. With the way it works right now, it should reset every month. 

**How do i know you can fix ARAM matchmaking and its just not the issue of thin playerbase?**  
  
Because:  
1) if you premade with lower MMR player, you instantly get matchmade with new players that you never seen before and the trend continues as long as you queue up with that lower MMR premade enough times. Even if you stop playing with that premade, your MMR with enough games gets lowered to the point, where you need to win many games to once again reach that old MMR,  
2) if you start a new account, you obviously have a fresh MMR and games arent swarmed of the regular players you are seeing. This stops working once you reach that MMR by winning many games. 

So as you can see, Riot can totally fix this and they should. 

  
**Matchmaking with the same players every single game every day can be annoying when some of these players are inters**

  
What if some of those players are inting scumbags? Well, there is actually one player like that in my games that is known not only by me, but also by other players in my games to be inting loser that runs down games with disgusting builds that have no business working and overall his gameplay is just going 0/10 in most of his games. And before you say 'ARAMs are for fun chill out' - well, they are not, according to Riot code of conduct, which expects every player to give his best efforts in every game hes in - whether its ranked, normal or even bot games. **You dont have a right to run down games with dogshit builds that have no business working, or running the game down with inting plays, because you are playing 'fun mode'.** Losing is never fun, especially when you are giving your best efforts to win. If you want a fun time going trash builds and dying every time you respawn, go make a custom game with people who tolerate this kind of gameplay. 

When you fix matchmaking system you also fix annoying and unnecessarily long queue timers that instead of finding you available players to queue up with, it waits 30-60 minutes to assemble 10 players of similar MMR - really? ARAM isnt ranked and it doesnt matter if 'challenger' mmr gets in game with low elo - there is no laning, no wave control, no need for perfect csing, no ganks, no objectives, no recall diff - noone of the gameplay parts of Summoners Rift that help estimate what the rank of a player should be. Better comp wins over skill anyway.   
Make ARAM MMR more flexible

**Riot adding more game modes is only thinning out already thin pool of players on ARAM**  
  
Arena was made a permanent game mode and just recently we all learned that ARAM Mayhem is gonna be permanent as well. Then you have Summoners Rift Ranked Solo, Ranked Flex, Swiftplay and Draft.

On paper it seems cool - so many different game modes to choose from, right? But what Riot great genius developers seem to not have anticipated - regular ARAM poor matchmaking is only getting more dogshit by adding more disparity between all these game modes. One half of ARAM players goes for regular ARAMs because they dont like all the augments and stuff - other half goes for Mayhem, because they like augments.   
It wouldnt be a problem, but with pile of dogshit matchmaking as we have it, it makes matchmaking put even more of the same players into your games that dont want to play Mayhem or other game modes.   
**Before you start thinning out already thin ARAM playerbase, make sure that matchmaking works correctly and gives you variety of different players.**   
Matchmaking having you stuck with the same players has been an issue ever since i started playing ARAMs back in 2016 - so adding more game modes is only gonna make the issue grow.   


**Fix behavioral system that punishes typing over in game activity**  


Now, as we all know reporting inting scumbags doesnt do anything - they are able to queue up again and again no matter how badly they int. The only instance when this game bans someone is when curse words are typed in chat - great behavioral system by the way.   
I have a sad example of my own when i used curse word in **party chat that only my premade saw and i got banned for it.** I guess what happened is simple - behavioral system being dog as it is, doesnt detect whether curse word was typed in team/all chat or in party chat and it just bans you for curse word said in premade chat, as if it was said in all chat. 

Does it matter that what i typed in premade chat was regular talk between two friends that didnt have any intention of offending another party? Guess it doesnt, because outdated and flawed Riot behavioral system doesnt care if noone besides your premade sees what you are typing or if you are actually offending them - just dont type curse words anywhere aside from private message, because we at Riot are too cheap to fix behavioral system and make it work correctly. 

Imagine if you are at the club in private room and noone outside the room can hear what is going on inside - you and your friend start talking curse words like regular people who are friends do. Then comes club managment and throws you both out for speaking curse words that noone could have possibly heard. Makes a lot of sense, doesnt it?

And i dont care what your reasoning for this is - that game when i was banned for typing curse word on party chat was me mistakingly typing in premade chat, instead of typing /r 'message' and that was my mistake. But should it really have resulted in a ban? Why does it matter if i type a curse word in DM - where only me and my friend can see those messages, and on party chat only - where also as in DMs, only me and my friend can see those messages?   
Makes no goddamn sense that you punish players for typing curse words on one chat and dont on the other when its literally the same thing.   


https://preview.redd.it/mjiehhghy2dg1.jpg?width=403&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9438ef39cf1a64699f372d291c98b68791d36b5d

This guy has totally ran down my game - by what i could have concluded from his behavior, he was non stop pinging our Ashe poke/ult spam build - which was reasonable, because we lacked damage and he went a build that he shouldnt. Guess it triggered the Maokai and he started running it down and dying on repeat.   
Obviously after the game i reported him - even took my time to submit a report player ticket about what he did, because aside from running down a game he also adds you to friends, wishes c\*\*\*\*r and immediately removes.   


**Guess what, because he didnt insult anybody in team chat, despite running game down and cursing people in DMs, he is welcome to queue up into more games.**   
Days passed and i didnt even get so much as a reply from Riot Support about what they are going to do with that player. But if he were to type a curse word in game chat, he would have been punished immediately. 

  
**You can literally run a game down, dying on respawn everytime and you dont get punished. Type a curse word in chat - instant punishment. You call that anything but a dogshit behavioral system that needs to be fixed immediately?**

That Maokai game, all you need to do to punish him is see his runes, build, KDA and stats like damage dealt or taken. You should have opened the game replay, see the first minute of the game when he sprints towards enemy team and dies. The system should have caught that type of behavior and it should have resulted in insta 7 days vacation or something.

If im not literally reported by my premade for verbal abuse after game - **you shouldnt be banning people for what they type to premade in game chat using premade only option.**  
But what if the premade isnt someone you know, but a random player you decided to queue up with after last game and they dont know you well enough to be typing insults to them and they can get offended by them?

In that case make an option in settings that will prevent bans by typing to someone you already know or something - i dont know, its just dumb af that you can get banned for typing curse word in party chat and people can run your game down, insult you in DM and they are untouched by behavioral system.

Most importantly, start taking action against players that play like garbage, int on purpose, build garbage items that have no way of working, punish all these dogshit Ashe players that go poke/ult build when your team lacks ADC damage. Those should be punishable offenses, not typing smack between two friends on party chat. 

  
**While ARAMs dont have positions like Summoner Rift, people should be aware of what builds they go and ruining game with dog build should be punishable**

This is tough matter, because on Summoners Rift everyone is assigned to a role and thats how playable team comps are formed. Sure, you dont always have that perfect team comp synergy - someone going another AD champion when you already have full AD comp, your support picking engage support instead of enchanter that your comp needs and ecetera. 

ARAMs are different, because you have a limited pool of random champions and suddenly implemeting a system that will force someone to pick ADC or frontline that your comp misses, would be impossible - because first of all, how do you determine which player should be forced to pick that ADC or frontline? Total nonsense

So, what im thinking is - punishing dumb players that go utility builds on ADCs when our team comp clearly lacks constant damage. **And dont get me wrong, i love builds variety and i love flirting with different builds myself, but when you see yet another poke Ashe in your game when your team lacks DPS, and enemy team is stacked with fully playable comp where noone goes useless build and you lose because your Ashe build doesnt provide DPS, it gets annoying**

Like that pissed off, running it down Maokai that i mentioned above - he got mad and rightfuly so, about our Ashe going ap poke/ult spam build, instead of typical ADC Ashe build. 

Poke and spamming ult on Ashe is fun, but only when your team already has a source of constant DPS - when we dont have that, we are on losing position every fight, simply because we lack damage to kill enemy team. 

This is build griefing and it should be taken care of. The amount of times my games were ruined by some mindless npc going incorrect build is crazy. People shouldnt be allowed to ruin games like that - dont queue up for ARAM if you have no knowledge of the game mode.   
Implement recommended build path based on what you team comp has or something - all i know is that all these Ashes going poke build when we need ADC is one of the reasons why losersq forces you to lose games you otherwise should have won, if you only had a human Ashe with enough chromosones to determine a right build for the game. Tank champions going full glass cannon builds when we lack tanky frontline are also ruining games. 



**Before you come up with a dumb idea of ever implementing Ranked ARAMs, here is why you shouldnt**

  
A game mode that doesnt let you pick your best champions isnt a good idea for a ranked environment - you want to tell me that someone who happened to be lucky in champion select and got all the best ARAM champions is gonna be higher up in the ladder than someone who plays better, but didnt have that much luck in champ select?

Even if you made ARAMs no longer random and implemented a lobby with literal champion select like on Summoners Rift - there is too many broken, game breaking champions that are made even more broken by a disgusting ARAM Buff/Nerf system that should be removed and redone from stratch, because i dont know how incompetent and never playing ARAM someone has to be, to be making balance changes like this. Varus no nerfs, Qiyana overbuffed despite being 200 years, failed design with AOE hard CC on assassin - really? List of misplaced buffs, lack of nerfs where they should be, is outrageous.

First of all - you dont need to be ARAM regular to see that ranged champions have huge adventage over melees. Playing most melees on ARAM is about playing pixel perfect, or you get hit by one root/stun, followed by another storm of ranged CC and you just get oneshot with no counterplay. 

Ranged champions hide behind their frontline and dont get focused by enemy team, so they are open to freely deliver damage and CC from safe place, without as much threat of being cc oneshot as melee champions are - i know, because im not a melee champions player only. I use many different ranged champions and the clear as day difference in game play between these two types of champions is crazy. Playing ranged is chill - always useful. Miss skillshot here and there - no biggie. Playing melee - sweating to play pixel perfect in order to not get CC chain oneshot. 

With how ARAMs operate, with how bad the difference between ranged and melee is, ARAM rankeds have no sense to exist. You are either a ranged abuser or you struggle with melee champions - and you wanna tell me that its a fair and competitive ranked environment?   
I can already imagine people abusing broken picks and reaching up to 100% winrate - just duo up with Yuumi player, pick overbuffed Twitch with so disgusting damage and you win almost 100% of the games you are in. Totally disgusting and uncompetitive 

Ranked ARAMs are only an option if 2/3 of ranged champions get nerfs they deserve, or better yet - melee champions, especially those immobile and without range, get buffs that prevent them from being CC chained and oneshot by taking a one wrong step during teamfight. You shouldnt be taken to half health, because you walked up in order to fight a ranged champion - you got accidentaly hit by one of the milion projectiles flying at you from range and that one projectile happened to be some CC - you get taken to half health if not oneshot, forced to stay back doing nothing, until you heal to reasonable amount that will make you able to rejoin the fight. 

What im saying is, if Morgana wants to fight with enemy Mel and see which one can root the other one for longer and onetap from range more efficiently - let them do it, but melee champions shouldnt be open to the same duration of annoying 2.5-3 seconds root, as ranged champions that are **harder to hit and they have easier job of dodging skillshots due to their distance, than melee champion thats forced to eat Morgana Q from melee range if he wants to fight her. You hit Morgana with Snowball - teleport on her with it, she simply clicks her Q in your face that you have no way of dodging. Congratulations, you are now rooted for 3 seconds right in front of enemy team that will surely oneshot you during that 3 seconds root window.** 

There is an unfair adventage on being a ranged champion - its so much easier and less sweating to play ranged champion than most melees - and its a fact you cant discuss with. 

ARAMs arent Summoners Rift, where you have 2 solo lanes and you can maybe have a wiggle room between minion wave, a jungler gank to help in ranged vs melee - to help that matchup. On ARAM, you are thrown into a game where most people pick ranged champions, so if you are melee enjoyer - you 'lane' against 5 ranged champions and good luck comboing any of them if you are Darius or some other Illaoi. You cant manipulate minion wave in such way that it makes that ranged abuser overextend in lane and be vunerable to ganks, or wait for ranged champion to make a mistake when you freeze your wave under your turret and try to find a window to go on them and chase in a long lane. Noone of those counterplay possibilities are possible for melee champions on ARAM. 

Instead of ranked ARAMs, fix matchmaking of regular ARAMs, remove losersq, fix disparity between ranged and melees and thats all you need to do to fix this situation. 



**Being forced to play an unwinnable match even if enemy team would all go AFK for 20 minutes, because 2 teammates refuse to FF** 

Listen, when im the only one on my team with positive KDA, the only one actually trying my best to win and im taken hostage by dumb bastards that for whatever reason refuse to FF and intentionally keep that miserable game up, instead of ending it with FF like they should - people should be able to go AFK when they are the only ones trying and not punished for it. If that bunch of inting losers enjoy being punching bags for enemy team - well, i dont and it makes me really angry to have to play out games that there is no way of winning.   
Fix surrendering system. A vote of a guy that goes 0/10 shouldnt have the same power as the vote of someone who tries to win the game. When im the only one trying, my vote should have a power of 2 votes. Inting bastards votes should be 0.5 of a vote or 0. Im good enough to be able to say when a game is over - i can take a quick look at my team comp and team comp of enemy team and easily say that its unwinnable for us even if enemy team all went AFK. Dont make me sit in those games, because its disgusting. Its disrespectful to be stuck in a game with inting losers when you are the only one trying - and they all decide that i should sit miserable in that losersq game with them. Democracy is fun and all, but sometimes dumb people vote shouldnt determine your fate. 



  
I will take a much needed break from this shitfest of a game, come back in few days to see if anything has changed. If not, maybe i will be forced to stop playing this game after a decade of being patient. I can understand everything, but being forced to wait 30 minutes for a one game, just so it can be another losersq tower defense, then queuing up for another 4 hours in hopes that this one game wont be a losersq stomp and long awaited one single win of the day - i cant possibly find any fun in that. Inting bastards going unpunished, while im getting banned for typing curse word in party chat with a friendly premade - what is wrong with this game?

Uganda Orders Two Rights Groups to Halt Work Days Before Election,1qbphvy,1,0,2026-01-13 12:00:33,CantaloupeFeeling838,u_CantaloupeFeeling838,"Uganda’s government has ordered two local human rights organisations to stop their operations just days before the country heads to the polls. The decision has raised serious concerns about freedom, transparency, and the credibility of the upcoming presidential election.

The organisations affected are Chapter Four Uganda and the [Human Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda.](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-orders-two-rights-groups-halt-work-days-before-election-2026-01-13/)

[Uganda’s National Bureau for NGOs orders two human rights organisations to halt operations days before the presidential election.](https://preview.redd.it/da9k1866w3dg1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8074386c288dd257bb5de1dfe29ed4e0e48984e3)

# Orders Issued by State NGO Bureau

Uganda’s National Bureau for NGOs sent formal letters to both groups instructing them to halt all activities with immediate effect. In the letter addressed to Chapter Four Uganda, the bureau accused the organisation of engaging in activities that threaten national security. HRNJ-U confirmed it received a similar directive. The head of the bureau, Stephen Okello, later confirmed the authenticity of the letters.

# Rights Groups Defend Their Work

Both organisations have long reported alleged human rights abuses in Uganda, including arbitrary arrests, torture of opposition supporters, harassment of journalists, and abductions linked to political activity. The groups insist their mission is to protect citizens and promote accountability, not to undermine national security.

# UN Warns of Repression Ahead of Polls

The United Nations Human Rights Office has warned that Uganda’s election is taking place in an atmosphere marked by fear, repression, and intimidation. In a recent report, the UN said police and military forces used live ammunition to break up peaceful rallies and carried out widespread detentions of opposition supporters. Hundreds of opposition-linked individuals have been arrested ahead of the January 15 vote.

# Museveni Seeks to Extend Long Rule

President Yoweri Museveni, now 81 years old, is seeking another term in office. He has ruled Uganda since 1986 after leading a rebel movement to power. Over the years, he changed the constitution to remove both age and term limits. Political analysts say his control over key institutions makes a change in leadership through elections unlikely.

# Arrest of Human Rights Activist

Last month, police arrested Sarah Bireete, a well-known human rights activist and outspoken critic of government abuses. She was detained at her home and charged with unlawfully handling voter information. Bireete denied the charges and remains in custody.

# Fears for Democracy

Human rights defenders say shutting down watchdog groups before elections weakens trust in the democratic process. They argue that silencing independent organisations limits transparency and accountability. Opposition leaders and civil society groups insist that free elections cannot take place without free monitoring.

# Growing International Concern

Uganda’s government has not formally responded to the United Nations report. International observers continue to express concern about shrinking civic space, political arrests, and restrictions on opposition activity.

# Conclusion

The closure of two human rights organisations just days before Uganda’s election has intensified fears about repression and fairness. As [President Museveni ](https://peopledaily.digital/inside-politics/wajackoyah-vows-to-make-voter-registration-compulsory-if-elected-president)seeks to extend his four-decade rule, many Ugandans and international observers worry that democracy in the country is under serious threat.

The World Is Preparing For WW3 According To World Leaders - Ignore Them! (Blog),1qbovnb,0,5,2026-01-13 11:25:24,Libbster2001-,politicsinthewild,"Whatever speech your leaders have written out and speak to you is not them conducting **neutral preparations** on your behalf. They’re trying to **psychologically mobilise our society for THEIR long-term conflict.** They call it an era of radical uncertainty for THEM. Not us. They say strength is the only effective response for THEM. Not us. They want to mobilise every element of our society for THEM. Not us. And have even increased our taxes to be spent on national security for THEM. Not us. They have blurred out our domestic lives, the economy, borders, technology and defence into THEIR security frame. This is **total-society framing**. In our human history, we have seen this before when states expected **prolonged confrontation** and not just a temporary crisis. Why are we allowing our fear to become structural? This just stops being defensive and starts shaping our identity. It doesn’t matter how **coherent, disciplined, and internally logical** your leaders may sound. They’re **rooted in their own fear-based mindset,** instead of being creative and reconciliatory on our behalf. Any system that is built on anyone’s fear, even when they articulate it as ‘security’ or ‘protection’ will inevitably generate the very conditions it seeks to prevent. Yes, the threats are real, but our leaders responses are misaligned.

Our leaders say strength is the only effective response. LIES. This is a **fundamental error.** Strength *without love* becomes coercion. Strength *without humility* becomes escalation. Strength *without self-awareness* becomes projection. Our leaders will cause an arms race. Our ‘enemies’ will harden. Morals are already being simplified into tyrants vs democracies. They’re reducing the space for de-escalation. Force restrains behaviour temporarily. It has never transformed intention. They frame national unity under threatening conditions that threaten THEM. You watch… your dissent, for whatever it may be, will not be tolerated anymore. Your government will morally pressurise you to conform. Whatever you disagree with them will be securitised. When fear dominates, our society will confuse its obedience with virtue and conformity with safety. You don’t have to live in an authoritarian environment for this to become authoritarian in effect.

Your governments are merging your economic life with defence. They call this ‘defence dividend’… how telling. Your jobs, your wages, your regional renewal and technological innovation are all tied to **permanent security mobilisation** and so our society becomes economically dependent on threat. Can you not see that we are feeding a system that requires danger to justify prosperity? Do you not see that it is this system that never allows peace to fully arrive? This is structurally destabilising in the long run. Yes, in reality, the world is geopolitically aggressive. Our leaders hold a responsibility to protect populations. They need to coordinate rather than cause chaos. It’s also important for us to recognise that our leaders are attempting to stabilise institutions, reduce domestic fragmentation, and restore predictability after political disorder. It’s not **malevolent, sadism or warmongering,** but the issue is the mindset of our leaders. It’s not so much their intention.

I warn you, when your leaders respond to their own inner fear by trying to amplify our fear in the population (even in disciplined, respectable language) they lock our society into THEIR self-fulfilling trajectory. Your leaders want to prepare you for THEIR war and it doesn’t always mean a response to danger. They’re trying to **condition your minds** into expecting it. What you expect is creative. Stop allowing yourselves to be psychologically tuned to your leaders **normalisation of their permanent high-threat mindsets.** Stop embedding their fear with yours into the economy, in your social and moral lives. The future political environment is flexible and your leaders are increasing the probability of escalation. Our leaders don’t want war, but their **fears are narrowing their perceptions** and they’re projecting that onto you. It’s **understandable, competently executed, and isn’t aligned with the deeper laws of one’s creative mindset.**

Don’t deny reality. Don’t internalise your leaders fears as fact. You can recognise the danger **without feeding panic.** You can stay informed **without surrendering your inner sovereignty.** You can refuse to be psychologically mobilised by your leaders even if the states peruse a material mobilisation. The war has already begun in our leaders minds! Then it externalises into weaponry. You must stay inwardly anchored so you **don’t participate** **in what fear creates.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/politicsinthewild/comments/1qbovnb/the_world_is_preparing_for_ww3_according_to_world/
Dating Under Watch: How Family Support Shapes Queer Women’s Intimate Lives.,1qbm1u0,5,0,2026-01-13 08:29:19,Sparky-moon,LGBTindia,"Ronita looks at the clock and gets out of her hostel room. She has informed her family that she will be visiting the library, and the library is the type of excuse she likes to make, as it seems to be the safest. Despite that, she walks down the stairs with her phone vibrating. She is anxious about missed calls.

To Ronita, dating is never spontaneous. It consists of route planning, deleting messages, and timekeeping.  “If I don’t pick up their call, they ask where I was and who I was with,” she says. “I’m always careful about what I say.”

Her family has no idea that she is queer. They make several calls a day to know her location. They examine her cell phone when she comes home. There is the deletion of chats, the hiding of apps, and the changing of contact names. It is not just that the fear is emotional rejection. “If they find out, they’ll stop my studies and bring me back home,” she says.

Ronita is also an example of a bigger truth in India for a number of queer women. Family surveillance rather than desire influences dating. Phone calls, curfews, and interrogation make intimacy a danger instead of an option. The possibility of the existence of any relationship depends, in many cases, on the way the life of a woman is closely observed in the home.

Surveillance changes everything Dating has a much different meaning to queer women, who are either rural or lower-middle or working class. Close monitoring is a common aspect when it comes to family . Phones are checked. Calls are frequent. Movements are tracked.

What is presented as an interest in security soon becomes domination. When I do not pick up their call, they would begin enquiring where I was and what I was doing, Ronita says. The necessity to always be on the defensive side of a case puts privacy and choice on the back burner.

Lying and a lot of planning are required when dating under such situations. The meetings are justified in terms of library visits or classes. Messages are deleted. Apps are hidden. Even little outings are strictly watched. It is not just emotional rejection which is feared, but the loss of independence.

Getting caught can spell doom, including being sent home, issuing threats of a marriage, and loss of education and employment. Homosexual relationships are perceived to be dangerous, something that may cause embarrassment or inconvenience. This fear is not abstract. Getting caught can spell doom, including being sent home, issuing threats of a marriage, and loss of education and employment. Homosexual relationships are perceived to be dangerous, something that may cause embarrassment or inconvenience.

Love in such situations is strained. There are no relationships that are ended because of a lack of feelings; the cost involved is too heavy to bear.

When dating feels impossible In more conservative or rural settings, dating feels almost impossible. Visibility invites gossip. Repeated interactions are noticed. Even friendships are questioned. Sathi is 28 years old, and she resides in the Birbhum district of rural West Bengal. She is a helper in a tailoring unit around the community, and she stays with her parents. Dating is not an accepted activity in her region, particularly among women.

“People don’t really go on dates here,” she said. “If a woman is seen with the same person again and again, people start talking.” She has very strict control over her movements by her family. She is supposed to be home by 6.30 in the evening, and going out at night is asking for questions. Her life is anchored on a routine: she has to work in the morning, and then in the afternoon she has to do the chores at home, and then she spends the evening watching TV with her family. Telephone conversations are reviewed, and delays should be explained. Together with this, she constantly hears the reminder that it is time to settle down. In such a setting, it is inconceivable to date another woman.

“I’ve liked someone for years,” she said quietly. She met the woman around three years ago through Facebook, in a queer discussion group. The other woman lives in Kolkata and works in the private sector. They have never met in person. “We only talk on calls, Sathi said. “That’s all we can do.”

The talks occur at an hour when her family is asleep. Throughout the day, they do not communicate. Physical proximity is unimaginable, and even emotional intimacy is very much controlled. ‘I do not think of coming out,’ she said. “I think of surviving.”

The conditional acceptance and its restrictions on dating Other queer women receive a different form of support, though with conditions. Their parents are aware of the fact that they are queer, but want it to stay in the shadows. Mampi, 30, who belongs to an upper-class conservative traditional Bengali family, is in between these two worlds. Her family background is a middle-class city family. Her parents are aware that she is queer, but she should not be seen. “They say, ‘Do what you want, but don’t bring trouble home,” she said.

Sathi is 28 years old, and she resides in the Birbhum district of rural West Bengal. “People don’t really go on dates here,” she said. “If a woman is seen with the same person again and again, people start talking.”

Priya can date, but with limits. No overnight stays. No neighbours finding out. No plans were discussed openly. Her family’s support is conditional. It allows space, but not recognition. Dating is possible, but commitment feels uncertain. “I can love someone,” she said. “But I don’t know if I can build a life.” This middle ground highlights how support is not a simple yes or no. It often comes with rules that shape how far a relationship can go.

When family support creates room Although the dating life of most queer women is influenced by family surveillance, a few of them have a different reality. In the case of members of higher classes, the assistance is usually provided in the shape of space and silence, not open acceptance. Dating can be possible even without being brought out openly, though in the case of queer women who belong to upper-class families. Their families do not necessarily know much about queerness; however, they do not intervene either.

Ananya, 26, comes from an upper-class family in Kolkata. She lives with her parents, both professionals, and works in a private firm. Her family knows she is queer, though they rarely talk about it openly. “My parents don’t ask where I’m going or who I’m meeting,” she said. “If I say I’m meeting a friend, that’s enough.” Ananya is a long-time girlfriend of her partner. They get to meet at cafes, go to events and even at times travel together. Although she does not demonstrate affection publicly, she is not afraid that she will be caught or interrogated.

Social comfort and not safety define her dating life. She said she was still clumsy in explaining things to family members. However, my parents do not monitor my phone and do not prevent me from going out. Family support does not imply pride flags or the reassurance that she needs all the time. It means space. Without surveillance, her relationship gets to be in the open despite being secret. This absence of questioning is important. Sharing relationships without the fear of overload includes access to personal space, financial independence and personal transport. Relationships are formed in cafes, at bookstores, or somewhere one can sit and rest and feel safe.

“I still avoid holding hands in public,” she added, “but I don’t feel like I’m doing something illegal.” Here, dating looks almost ordinary. There are worries about compatibility, emotional vulnerability, and the future, but not the constant fear of being caught. Queerness exists quietly, but not in complete hiding.

Sneha, 24, is a post-graduate student from an elite family. As she emerged, her parents could not tell what to feel, but they were not angry. “They said they didn’t understand it, but they trusted me,” she said. That confidence is translated to freedom. Later, going out does not cause panic calls. Friendships are not questioned. Dating is a normal life, and it does not require the use of extensive cover-ups. Silence is security in these families. The family does not see, and the non-seeing makes space.

Queer intimacy, control, and class In all these experiences, there is one strong trend, which is that class defines the manner of queerness living and experiencing. Queer scholar Srila Roy insists that the norms of class, caste, and respectability still define the way queer life is perceived and experienced in India, and social hierarchies can affect the relation to identity, as well as access to space, autonomy, and dignity. In most families, the privilege of classes enables one to ignore discomfort, establishing silence instead of close examination; money and personal privacy.

Families in upper, lower and middle classes, however, tend to use surveillance as a way of dealing with risk. The actions of women are directly connected to the reputation of the family, and authority is normally packaged as compassion. Queer dating has become perceived as a problem and not necessarily the choice in this environment. Intimacy turns out to be something secretive, to control, and to sacrifice.

Loving quietly, at a cost In the case of queer women who do not have the support of their families, the emotional burnout cost is high. Continuous concealment brings about fear and fatigue. Relationships seem to be short-lived. The future feels uncertain. “I don’t dream far,” Ronita said. I simply consider the following week. Conversely, women whose families are supportive and have no interference talk of plans. Living together. Building partnerships. Imagining futures. There is a distance between these, and a mere question is the result. Who is allowed to date at the expense of love?

Until the family support can find a way beyond silence and regulation, most queer women will keep loving quietly, cautiously and at a price. Family support is said to be emotional. However, to lesbian women, it is highly functional. It defines the access to space, time, privacy and safety. It determines when dating is mundane or risky.

However, to lesbian women, it is highly functional. It defines the access to space, time, privacy and safety. It determines when dating is mundane or risky.

Throughout, there is no consistent appearance of support that resembles celebration. Occasionally, it is just a matter of not being monitored. As long as families do not abandon surveillance and control, dating life of queer women will remain an affair of fear as opposed to choice. Intimacy will be disjointed and bargained.

To most of the queer women in India, it is not about whether they desire to love, but rather it is about whether they are permitted to love. It is already tricky to be queer in India. It is accompanied by stigma, silence, and low levels of social acceptance. This is not the only struggle that queer women face. This is further discrimination, being a woman is more regulated, less freedom and observation and regulation of behaviour and desire.

They are judged in their queerness and police their womanhood. Collectively, these forces complicate the decisions made in everyday life, such as dating, meeting someone or envisioning a future, even more.

Identity and Survival in Eko and Sinners,1qblh8w,2,1,2026-01-13 07:52:56,twohundredeleven,SocialfFilmmakers,"https://preview.redd.it/fjvjf0qfo2dg1.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=e743c2ac9b282513ee891389cc629a89a556c414

Both Sinners and Eko are stories about people trying to hold on to who they are in situations that want to make them something else. What makes the comparison interesting is that neither film begins with obvious villains. The forces that threaten identity often arrive in the language of protection. The church says it wants to save souls. A husband promises security. A community enforces its values “for the good of everyone.” In Sinners, the pressure is external and visible. Racism, the KKK and even supernatural creatures try to break apart a fragile Black community, and the characters respond by building a place where they can sing, dance and remember themselves. In Eko, the threat is inside the home. Men who claim to love Mlaathi Chedathi isolate her, rename her, and decide where she should live. Her survival is not found in joining others, but in refusing. She chooses solitude, she keeps her dogs close, and she refuses another life that someone else has planned for her. Both films show that care can easily turn into containment, and that identity is something people have to defend, even against those who claim to be protecting them.

The worlds of both films are places where identity is already under strain. Sinners is set in the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s, when Jim Crow law and the constant threat of violence shaped every interaction. Outside the juke joint there are crosses, mobs, and sermons that pretend to defend morality. Inside the juke joint there is music, sweat, and bodies moving together. In Eko, the pressure comes from domestic and cultural hierarchies that treat protection as ownership. Mlaathi Chedathi is married young in Malaysia, controlled by her husband and his dogs, and later taken to Kerala by Kurianchan, who also claims to be rescuing her. Even her name is replaced by what the villagers call her. Her original name, Soyi, disappears. In both films, identity is never assumed to survive on its own. It must be remade and defended, and both environments make this work difficult.

In Sinners, identity is rebuilt through gathering. The juke joint the twins create is not just a business. It is a space where people can recognise themselves in each other. When the band plays, the film captures a moment where the past, present and future are all happening at once. The songs carry ancestral memory, the dancers use their bodies without fear, and for a while the outside world cannot reach them. Identity is not remembered, it is enacted. This is why the night feels legendary. Even Remmick, the vampire, cannot look away. Watching the people dance, he remembers that he once had a culture of his own. The film makes this connection explicit later, when Remmick says to Sammie,

>*“I want your stories and I want your songs and you are going to have mine.”*

He longs for what the juke joint contains. He longs for his own history.

Because identity in Sinners is communal, the forces that threaten it work by breaking people apart. The church claims to guard purity, yet its sermons shame those who dance and those who drink. The preacher keeps telling Sammie to put down his guitar. Music is described as sinful and dangerous, even though it is the one thing that allows Sammie to feel like himself. The KKK claims to protect the community, yet their protection means terror and control. The vampires promise comfort and family. When they lure Cornbread, they whisper to him from the dark, promising “love and affection.” They offer belonging but what they are really offering is obedience. Remmick even prays with Sammie. After Sammie begins reciting the Lord’s Prayer, the vampires join in as if they share one mind. When they finish, Remmick says,

>*“Long ago, the men who stole my father’s lands forced these words upon us. I hated those men but the words still bring me comfort.”*

The film shows how a system can steal a culture and then replace it with a religion that pretends to heal what it destroyed. The juke joint represents the opposite. It is a place made by Black people for themselves, outside white control. This is why it is both beautiful and dangerous. It is a space where belonging is real, which makes it a target.

Each major character in Sinners has a different way of trying to survive. Stack believes identity can be secured through money and force. He does not want to let anyone into the juke joint for free. He sends Mary Ann to approach the strange white customers to see if they have enough money. He trusts violence and business before he trusts people. This protects him for a while, but it isolates him, and in the end it turns him into a vampire. Smoke turns inward. He smokes, he avoids pain, and the community avoids him in return. When the group finds a man lying in what appears to be a pool of blood, they believe he has been bitten. In reality, he was merely passed out drunk, and so they throw him out. This abandonment is what gets him turned. Annie resists in a different way. She isn’t a member of the church, ignores the moral rules of the church, cares for the vulnerable, and is called a witch by Stack. The word has a long history of being used against women who refuse obedience. Mary Ann, white presenting but raised Black, never belongs entirely to either world. Her liminal identity makes her useful and disposable, and she is the first to be turned. Through these characters, the film suggests that identity can be guarded through violence, through withdrawal, through refusal or through performance, but none of these paths are safe.

The film fears not simply violence, but false belonging. The vampires operate like a hive. They move together and repeat each other’s words and even feel their leader’s pain. They promise what the people in the juke joint long for. They promise an end to loneliness, a family that lasts forever, and a life without pain. Yet what they offer is a unity with no individuality inside it. When Remmick baptises Sammie in the lake he says,

>*“Those men lied to themselves and to us. They told stories of a god above and a devil below and lies of a dominion of man over beast and earth. We are earth and beast and god. We are women and men. We are connected. You and I to everything.”*

The scene is seductive, beautiful, and chilling. It is a promise of belonging without the freedom to be oneself. Sammie’s final answer is not argument. He sings. In the post credits scene he sings

>*“This little light of mine, I’m going to let it shine.”*

His music is his light. When Remmick dies he finally sees the sun, and an instrumental version of “Rocky Road to Dublin” plays on the soundtrack. It hints at the Irish identity he longs for but cannot fully possess. In this world, identity found through joy is powerful, but it is fragile. Every moment of connection draws the attention of forces that want to dissolve it.

In Eko, identity is threatened by those who are closest. Mlaathi’s life is shaped by men who insist they are protecting her. Her first husband in Malaysia treats her like a daughter. What looks like tenderness is actually control. The dogs at their home guard her as much as they guard the house. When Kurianchan arrives, he continues the pattern. He tells her that her husband is dead, and that he will take her to India. Only much later does she learn that this was a lie, that her husband was imprisoned rather than dead. She has been moved across borders under false promises. In Kerala, she is not called by her name. The villagers call her Mlaathi Chedathi, which means Malaysian grandmother. Her identity is reduced to nationality and age. She does not choose this name, it is given to her. Community is not safety, it is a system that decides who she is allowed to be.

The structure that keeps her in place is maintained by loyalty and violence, and the film gives this system a face in Peyoos. He is described as Kurianchan’s loyal dog. His devotion is unquestioning. He patrols the hill, and kills those who are here to find Kurianchan with bad faith and he enforces Kurianchan’s will. He does not believe he is violent. He believes he is loyal and correct. He is not the mastermind of patriarchy. He is the follower who makes it work. This echoes the dogs of Mlaathi’s first husband, who guarded her and helped keep her in place. Peyoos is the human version of the same logic. He knows who he is because he knows whom he serves. The film quietly reverses the expected hierarchy. The real dogs begin to show companionship, memory and eventually protection. The loyal man behaves like an animal repeating commands. Power does not survive through the powerful alone. It survives through ordinary obedience.

What complicates Mlaathi’s story is that the very symbol of her captivity becomes her strength. The dogs are not just pets. They are a special Malaysian breed. Kurianchan sought out Soyi and her husband because they bred these animals. Her husband treated her like his daughter, which is where she learned how to nurture and train them. This knowledge becomes part of her identity. The dogs are her link to her past. She raises them with care, she feeds them, and she refuses to let anyone take them. They are not sentimental. They are inheritance. In Sinners, the past is carried in song. In Eko, the past is carried in animals. One is loud, communal and ecstatic. The other is quiet, solitary and fiercely guarded. In both films, identity does not always survive through language. Sometimes it survives through practice and through bonds that cannot be explained.

The film’s final revelation deepens this logic. For most of the story, it seems that the dogs still belong to Kurianchan. It looks like they are guarding him the way they once guarded her. Only at the end do we learn that this is no longer true, at lest not in the same sense. When Kurianchan goes into hiding, he expects his dogs to protect him, feed him, and keep others away. This is how he once survived in the past. But now the dogs serve Mlaathi. They are keeping him trapped. They are guarding the entrance not to his refuge but to his prison. After she learns from his partner in crime that her whole life with him was built on a lie, she quietly turns the structure that once confined her back onto him. She uses the same method. Protection that is actually imprisonment. Care that is actually containment. The film does not present this as justice. It presents it as symmetry. She does not escape the system. She reproduces it, but this time she is the one in control.

Mlaathi does not break the cycle. She continues it, but she does so knowingly. The hill is still a prison, yet it is her prison, and she chooses to remain. Early in the film, when Peyoos asks why she does not chain her dogs like everyone else, she cuts him off with a simple answer:

>*“This is how I choose to raise them.”*

It is not an explanation, it is a boundary. Her whole life has been shaped by other people deciding what is best for her. The dogs are the first thing she raises on her own terms. They move freely around her, and by the end of the story they enforce her freedom by keeping Kurianchan trapped. The film is quiet and watchful. She waits, she listens, she tends to the animals, and she refuses to be moved again. She does not join another community and she does not collapse into victimhood. She becomes the guardian of her own solitude. In this way, Eko offers a vision of identity that is very different from Sinners. Where Coogler’s film celebrates the moment when people come together, Eko treats separation as the only way to remain oneself. Both worlds are full of loss, violence and deception, but they offer opposite strategies for living through them. One keeps the door open. The other bolts it shut.

Seen together, the two films act like mirrors. In Sinners, identity is made with others. Music, rhythm and bodies in motion create a space where people see each other clearly. In Eko, identity survives alone. Mlaathi’s strength is not shared, and her memories are not collective. In the juke joint, to belong is to be free. On the hill, to belong would be to lose the self. The idea of community has opposite meanings in the two films. Both warn that there is always a cost. A community can save you, and it can trap you. Isolation can protect you, and it can imprison someone else. Identity is shaped by the conditions under which it must survive. Sometimes through gathering, sometimes through retreat.

What connects these opposite strategies is the way both films show how care can work like control. In Sinners, the church says it cares for souls. The preacher tells Sammie to put down his guitar because he believes he is saving him. The mob says it protects the community, but what it protects is fear. The vampires say they offer family. When they pray with Sammie, they use his own comfort against him. In Eko, the pattern is closer to home. Husbands insist they are looking after Mlaathi. Their protection limits her movements, changes her name and erases her identity. Even her son’s offer to take her to the city is framed as love. The film never doubts his affection. It only asks whether affection is enough. Sometimes to be cared for is to be contained.

The difference between the films can be understood as a tension between community and immunity. In Sinners, identity is protected by gathering together. The juke joint is a sanctuary, but it is also a target. Its openness makes it vulnerable. In Eko, identity is protected by solitude. Mlaathi closes the gates of her life. Her identity is shielded, not shared. Neither film claims one method is better. Both show the need to balance openness and defence. Too much exposure invites danger in Sinners. Too much distance leaves Mlaathi alone, and she becomes the warden of another person’s captivity. Identity is fragile in both worlds. It has to be remade constantly.

What keeps identity alive in both films is not language or theory, but embodied memory. In Sinners, history is carried in melody, rhythm and shared movement. When they dance, they inherit a language older than the place they live in. Sammie refuses to stop playing, even when told to. In the final moments, when he sings “This little light of mine,” his music becomes a light that others can gather around. In Eko, memory is quieter. It is carried in the dogs, in the way she feeds them and in the way they guard her. They hold the fragments of a past that cannot be spoken. In both stories, identity is something people do. It lives in gestures, in bodies, and in attachments that endure even when names change and communities fall apart.

Neither film offers easy redemption. The juke joint cannot survive untouched. The hill remains a place of confinement. Yet both films offer versions of survival that matter. A circle of dancers on a wooden floor. A woman on a hill with dogs that carry her past. Identity persists not because the world is kind, but because people find ways to live without disappearing. Sinners and Eko offer two opposite but equally compelling answers to the question of how to remain oneself in a world that wants to reshape you. One gathers others close and lets the music play. The other stays apart and keeps watch. Both insist that survival is not simply staying alive. It is defending the small space where identity still has room to breathe.

How We Got Here and Where We Go From Here,1qamjj4,1,1,2026-01-12 05:30:31,DarthLux01010,complaints,"TLDR Below. 

After watching our political system devolve for 
years on end, I’m left with a conclusion I keep arguing with myself about. Part of me hates the idea of a national divorce. Part of me still wants “Team America,” however naïve that sounds in 2026. But I’m also increasingly resigned to the possibility that we may need some kind of separation, or at least a negotiated, gradual process where parts of the country leave amicably. Not because it’s clean or good, but because I don’t know what reconciliation even means anymore when we don’t share facts, we don’t share trust, and we don’t share a basic understanding of what legitimate government is.
This is one history and political economy major and teacher’s take on how America became so fucked. It’s broad strokes. It’s opinion. But I think it’s basically accurate. If there are errors, I want them pointed out. I’ll put my book and reading recommendations at the bottom.

This didn’t happen overnight. That’s the thing that drives me insane. People talk about the last election cycle or the last outrage like it’s the whole story, but what we’re living through is the result of decades. Decades of economic inequality compounding, decades of political incentives getting worse, decades of institutional capture, decades of media fragmentation, decades of civic trust being eaten alive, and decades of people being taught to blame sideways instead of up. We didn’t fall off a cliff in one day. We walked here slowly, and now we’re looking around like we just woke up in a nightmare.

America has always been a weird contradiction. On paper, we’re a multiethnic, multicultural democratic republic that claims to prize liberty and equality. In practice, we’ve spent huge chunks of our history banning people, deporting people, and treating people inhumanely just because of who they are. That’s reprehensible. But it’s also true that we’ve always had this push-and-pull between ideals and reality. There are moments where we try to become the country we say we are. And there are moments where the mask slips and you see what power actually does when it’s unrestrained.

The problem is that tension between ideals and reality does not stay stable. It gets exploited. And one of the oldest tools in the American playbook is division. Racial tension isn’t new. It’s foundational, and it’s been used from early on as a method of social control. The aftermath of Bacon’s Rebellion is one example of elites learning that if poor people unite across lines, the system is in trouble, so you keep them separated. You keep them afraid. You teach them to blame sideways instead of up.

But if I had to name the single biggest driver of our modern collapse, it’s not just race or culture war. It’s economic inequality. The gap between the top and everyone else has become so massive that it’s warped everything: our politics, our media, our institutions, our social trust, and our ability to act like we live in the same country. People at the very top, the ones with all the money, influence, time, and access, shape policy and culture while having no clue what life is like for the majority. And if they do have a clue, they often do not care. Either way the outcome is the same. A system engineered to serve the people who already have power, and increasingly indifferent to the people who don’t.

That inequality doesn’t just make life harder. It makes democracy weaker. When most peoplare economically insecure, they’re not living in a world where civic participation is easy. They’re living in a world where survival comes first. If you’re one emergency away from ruin, you don’t have time to be an engaged citizen. You have time to keep your job, pay rent, and keep your head above water. And that’s where authoritarian politics thrives. FDR had the right instinct. Economic insecurity is the soil dictatorships grow in, because it creates fear, resentment, and desperation. Those are the emotions demagogues know how to weaponize.
And then, on top of that economic foundation, you have a political system that’s basically built to reward the worst behavior.

We have one political party, the GOP, that treats winning at all costs as acceptable. Gerrymandering, disinformation, outrage, corruption, voter suppression, shameless norm-breaking, whatever works, they’ll do it. They’re determined to hold power and they’re willing to wreck democratic legitimacy to keep it. And the system helps them do it. The Senate, the Electoral College, gerrymandered districts, and voting restrictions all create choke points where a minority can hold disproportionate power. Add in courts that have weakened voting rights enforcement, and you get a political playing field tilted so hard that people stop believing participation matters.

Meanwhile, the Democrats drive me insane in a different way. They’re feckless. They’re too cautious. They’re too donor-dependent. Too many of them act like this is still a normal era where polite institutions will self-correct if you just act reasonable enough. That world is gone. And too many elected officials across the board are old, detached from reality, and insulated from consequences because they’ll be dead before the long-term damage fully lands. 

 Democrats always say vote for us, we’re not as bad as them. Look how bad they are. Yet they don’t stand for anything meaningful. What concrete policies that do not simply tinker around the edges are they actually proposing that would have a real, immediate impact on the lives of everyday Americans? The only ones who feel like they live up to the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society are AOC, Zohran Mamdani, and Bernie Sanders. Maybe Elizabeth Warren. Everyone else seems content managing the status quo while telling us the other side is the apocalypse. I believe them about the apocalypse. I just don’t believe them that they have a solution. 

Then there’s money, because money is the glue holding this entire rotten structure together.

Corporations and wealthy operatives have been building influence machines for decades: funding colleges, think tanks, media narratives, lobbying operations, and pipelines into government and the courts. Politics becomes an ecosystem where what’s possible is defined by donors and the people donors pay. Citizens United in 2010 didn’t invent that, but it absolutely poured gasoline on it by expanding how wealthy interests can flood elections through independent spending. The practical effect is obvious. The public gets a vote, but the investor class gets the menu.

Then the economy does its part. Many free trade and globalization policies might look efficient on paper, but they gutted parts of the middle and working classes in reality. Whole communities got hollowed out, jobs disappeared, wages stagnated, and the people who benefited told the losers to just adapt. When people are struggling, they look for someone to blame. Immigrants become an easy scapegoat, much easier than blaming the rich and powerful people at the top who actually structure the economy and capture most of the gains.

And that’s where you hit the wall, because even if people see what’s happening, what are they supposed to do?

So many Americans are barely scraping by. How do you protest if missing work means losing your job or apartment? How do you get educated when it costs tens of thousands of dollars? How do you stay informed when local news is dying, media ownership is consolidating, and social media is basically an outrage machine that profits from disinformation? How do you risk arrest when legal fees and missed work could financially destroy you? People have almost no leisure time, constant stress, and this lingering dread that one bad event, a medical bill, a car repair, a layoff, could wreck their entire life. That’s not a population set up for civic virtue. That’s a population set up for burnout and manipulation.

Then comes the part that feels like the tipping point. The normalization of cruelty, and the collapse of shared reality.

This administration has gone beyond what many of my worst fears as a progressive were. Watching a mother get killed in public and then watching people justify it by calling her a domestic terrorist shook me to my core. I feel ashamed that this is the one that hit me so hard given how many examples of state violence and law enforcement abuse are sitting all over our history. But it hit me, because it felt like a signal flare. Rights are becoming conditional, and violence is being rebranded as necessary as long as it targets the right enemy.

And then there’s the foreign policy mess. 

Threatening to take over Greenland, talking like we’re entitled to other people’s land (like we have previously in our history) acting like alliances don’t matter. That wasn’t on my Trump 2.0 bingo card either. It’s surreal. It’s humiliating. It’s scary. We’re starting to sound less like a democratic republic and more like a strongman state with a flag and a story we tell ourselves.

What scares me just as much as the actions is the reaction. The eagerness of many people on the right to say she deserved it, to treat brutality as morally fine because the label domestic terrorist was applied. This is terrifying. Social media and Fox News aren’t the only sources of brain rot, but they are major accelerators. They’ve trained people to live inside a reality where the other side isn’t mistaken, it’s evil. Where democracy is optional. Where cruelty is justice. You can’t reach across the aisle with that. There is no aisle. There are two separate realities.

So how do we have a free society when we’re living in two different realities? How do we run a democracy with this much poverty, ignorance, inequality, greed, and corruption? We don’t have civic virtue because we can’t afford it, materially or psychologically. People are stressed, atomized, and constantly primed to hate. Both sides fear and despise the other and assume the worst about each other.

Here’s the thing. I genuinely wanted another path. I hoped Democrats would learn from Trump 1.0. I hoped they’d come out swinging with policies so concrete and immediate that they cut through the lies. Policies that regulate the economy, regulate the media ecosystem, and actually improve daily life fast enough that people feel it in their bodies, not just in talking points. I want Team America, unironically. I want a country built around freedom, justice, security, dignity, and equality. I want renewal and reconciliation.

I love my country so much. Despite all it's flaws, it's injustices and everything. It's my home. It's done great things. We've gone to the moon, abolished slavery (in theory, see prison labor), we created a multiethnic Republic. But I don't know how we recover from this. 

The Democrats are too feckless. The system is too captured. The reforms we’d need, constitutional changes, structural election reform, serious anti-corruption rules, serious economic floor-building, are insanely hard to pass through institutions designed to slow change and protect incumbents. And even if sanity returned tomorrow, we’d still need accountability for abuses of power, because if you don’t punish it, it becomes precedent. But accountability would trigger backlash and probably violence again. That’s how broken this is.

So what the fuck do we do?

That’s why I keep landing on national divorce, even though I don’t like it. It feels like giving up on a country I want to believe in. It feels like admitting we failed. But I don’t see a stable one country future if we can’t agree on reality, rights, and legitimacy. If we keep forcing it, I think we get a slow-motion collapse into permanent crisis and periodic political violence. A separation sounds extreme, but the situation is already extreme.
If it ever happened, it would have to be slow and deliberate. Let the right have their Christian utopia across much of the South and Midwest. 

Let the left have the coasts and the Northwest. Do it over ten years, with safeguards designed specifically to prevent an India and Pakistan scenario. No mass displacement. Real protections for minorities trapped on the wrong side. Clear rules on citizenship and movement. Serious security arrangements to prevent political violence. I’m not writing a legal blueprint. I’m describing how fractured we are, and how dangerous the alternative feels.

But this again brings up the problem of moneyed interests. I have no doubt they'd swoop in during the national divorce process to try and rig things in their favor. 

And to our European and Western allies, we’re not all ignorant, thuggish caricatures. A lot of us are horrified, exhausted, and watching this unfold with dread. Many of us feel powerless not because we don’t care, but because the system is structured to keep normal people financially insecure, information-poisoned, and politically irrelevant.

Yes, it sounds like excuses. But it’s also the truth. Millions of people are doing the best they can inside a system that feels rigged, brittle, and increasingly dangerous. And I honest to God hope we can still find a way out that doesn’t involve divorce, because if we keep pretending this is normal, I think the outcome is worse.

TLDR: This crisis was built over decades. Inequality and economic insecurity hollowed out civic life, money captured institutions, and media ecosystems trained people to live in different realities. The GOP has embraced winning at all costs, Democrats feel too feckless to meet the moment, and the system is structured to amplify minority power and block reform. I still want reconciliation and renewal, but I’m increasingly resigned to the idea that some kind of carefully managed separation might be the least-bad way to prevent the country from sliding into permanent crisis and political violence",https://www.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1qamjj4/how_we_got_here_and_where_we_go_from_here/
Reconstructed America - Washington CoN Meetings - Decisions about East Asia (Preview) - Part 1 - READ EVERYTHING,1qa232u,19,24,2026-01-11 15:26:19,TWAAsucks,Presidentialpoll,"*(Before starting in-character talk, I need to explain what this is. After the collapse of the Empire of Japan, the US and the Coalition of Nations will decide how to act in East Asia: which forces to support, which territorial claims to support, what to do with unorganized regions, etc.* ***YOU*** *will make these decisions in the next post. This post is a preview of what these decisions will be. There will be questions and options. Instead of conducting many polls on Reddit itself, I will create a Google Form where you would choose different options. Maps will be provided. Not in all cases will the answer with majority or plurality be final, as context to other decisions will matter. Ask if you have questions. Anyways, time to begin.)*

The scene is like none other that Washington has seen in a long time. Powerful people from around the world are ready to decide the future of the entire region. The United States of America is represented by President Vern Ehlers alongside Secretary of State John McCain, Secretary of Defense Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., with Attorney General Ben Miller present for some reason. However, the President isn't in charge of the meetings. Just weeks ago he asked his former presidential opponent Wesley Clark to come out of retirement and become Commander of the CoN Strategic Forces in East Asia. This is not just a military title, but also a leadership one. Ehlers couldn't deny Clark's abilities and pushed for his appointment, likely to show a unified effort.

The US isn't the only power at the table. Other CoN members take part in the initial Operation *Fallen Sons of Fallen Suns*, and their voice matters. The President of the European Union, Viacheslav Chornovil, holds the position and must prove it isn't useless. He overshadowed his countryman and rival, President of Ukraine Hennadiy Udovenko, as Ukraine has nothing in play. The German Union is represented by President Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chancellor Claudia Nolte, having the strongest European voice. Somewhat a dynamic duo of outsiders, they lead the allied coalition in Germany. The United Kingdom of Britain and Ireland has Prime Minister Frank Field, willing to show cooperation after a contested election. France is represented by President François Léotard, willing to hear proposals. Another key player is the President of the Russian Republic, Garry Kasparov. This may be a make-or-break moment for the young president, as the country placed its trust in him and in the future of the Russian Republic.

These meetings take place over several days. There are many talks, debates, and some shouting, but in the end everything is organized into a collection of questions answered by vote. Every country has one vote, so each side must decide where it stands.

So here is the overall map of East Asia at the moment:

https://preview.redd.it/0qhdun7fjqcg1.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a1feb4db7b72dec29adfb9596ac818fcee35ed

# Japanese Mainland

https://preview.redd.it/kbjlwuphjqcg1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f0ac33e3f39730b1f39153a2bca22cf11e119b4

The first and most important question is Japan itself. The mainland is in a second warlord state, with many factions fighting for power. The royal family is nowhere to be seen and Emperor Naruhito is presumed dead, making the conflict all or nothing.

Much of the central islands are controlled by General Ichirō Ozawa and his military junta. By CoN advisors' assessment, this faction has the biggest advantage. Ozawa opened the door for cooperation. Not supportive of democracy and ruling with an iron fist, the general promises to stabilize the country and stop suffering. His methods are ruthless and he already purged people in his ranks. Still, if the CoN wants to stop the bleeding, generals suggest backing him.

The Democratic forces present a natural choice, but with disadvantages. They control the largest number of nuclear weapons, yet their fighting forces are weak, and the CoN wants to avoid more nukes flying over Japan. These forces are not united under one leader, and their territories are often disconnected. Some groups committed documented war crimes. This could change with military aid and leadership. The US and others don't want boots on the ground, but aid could be a solution.

Another option is cooperation with Admiral Shintaro Ishihara. This likely would not result in a unified Japan, which some CoN nations see as positive. Ishihara controls key naval ports, easing humanitarian aid. Though a dictator, he expressed ideas of democracy coming one day. Advisors distrust him, as he lied about administrative actions and is cruel to enemies. Still, the CoN could take the chance.

Other factions exist that the CoN would not support but could threaten peace. These include the militant feminist group *Onna-musha*, which moved from Okinawa to the south and proclaims the rule of men is over and the Empress should rule. They disrupted aid shipping. There are Socialist and Communist groups: Soviet Socialists, Totalitarian Socialists, Syndicalists, Militant Socialists, Agrarian Communists, and others. There are feudal states like kingdoms, oligarchies, and even a new empire in the north. Further north are navy factions, police states, minority-based republics, and dictatorships. There are also cults, smugglers, and pirates.

Beyond supporting the General, Democrats, or Admiral, there is the option of staying away militarily. This view is voiced by reluctant CoN members. It means non-interference and letting events play out. The main issue is security: if uncontrolled, nobody knows how it will affect the world. Still, it is an option.

The final option, requiring the most convincing, is an allied occupation of mainland Japan. It is the riskiest choice, as many nukes are controlled by different groups. This would require more operations like *Fallen Sons of Fallen Suns*, and even then the risk of a nuclear strike on a CoN country is high. Occupation would give full control over reconstruction, but many believe the risks outweigh benefits. Still, the US could push for it if Ehlers and Clark see it as necessary.

So the options are:

* **Support one side;**
* **Not interfere;**
* **Try to occupy Japan.**

If supporting one side wins, the question becomes:

* **Support General Ichirō Ozawa;**
* **Support Democratic forces;**
* **Support Admiral Shintaro Ishihara.**

# China

https://preview.redd.it/liuj9a6jjqcg1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=80067a5ef4760af16199fae3341467226ecc9061

The situation in China is more stable than in Japan, but still unstable. The remains of the Reorganised Chinese Government, a former Japanese puppet state, have been pushed into coastal areas as other forces advance. The question now is what to do next.

The Hainan Republic, a CoN ally for decades since the Japanese occupation of China, controls a large part of the south. The Republican Forces, fighting to re-establish the Republic of China, control the plurality of the region and are the main force opposing the RCG. Officially allies, they are rivals behind the scenes. Both seek to unify China in their own image, driven by ethnic composition and different approaches to the conflict.

The Hainan Republic includes many ethnic minorities, Han Chinese, and even Japanese populations that lived in HR-controlled areas before and after Japan’s collapse. HR favors diplomacy over military conflict with ethnic states. The Republican Forces are led by Han Chinese who believe unification must result in a Han-led Chinese state. They reject negotiations on minority independence and favor force.

The choice is between the Hainan Diplomatic Solution and the Republican Military Solution. The Hainan option would spare the CoN additional aid commitments, but the Republican option is more popular with the general population. There is fear that rejecting the Republican Solution could lead to conflict with the Hainan Republic. There is also the Socialist Republic of Zhuang, which may reject unification into a non-socialist system.

Another option is to stay out and let the conflict play out. As with Japan, this allows focus elsewhere, but leaves the CoN without control over events.

So the options are:

* **Support the Hainan Diplomatic Solution;**
* **Support the Republican Military Solution;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Korea

https://preview.redd.it/2lpsie3pjqcg1.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=61d25e63d90cf6e4d6362f25afd95d3f5d8b28b8

The situation in Korea is the most stable of any large former Japanese colonial possession. After the rapid power vacuum following the September 11th Incident, military forces largely made up of ethnic Koreans aligned with the Korean Government in Exile under Kim Pyong Il and Kim Dae-jung and took control of most of the region. Many Japanese soldiers were arrested, but small forces of the Reorganised Korean Government remain in the Haeseo region in the west, where the main naval ports are located. Experts believe it is only a matter of time before the RKG falls, making the decision easier.

One option is to help the Free Korean Forces destroy the RKG. This would ensure Korea becomes a loyal CoN ally and could assist in other regions.

The other option is to provide no military aid and let Korea defeat the RKG alone. This would save resources for more unstable regions, but Korea would be less willing to help the CoN later.

So the options are:

* **Help the Free Korean Forces;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Indochina

https://preview.redd.it/xok4ye2sjqcg1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d822326c038a7b09619ed038231a0c1715e728b

In Indochina, countries reacted quickly and took territories formerly under Japanese administration. However, many disputes remain over who has valid claims.

Thailand claims much of the area due to Thai populations. However, these populations belong to different Thai ethnic groups. Critics argue this weakens Thailand’s claim, while others say it strengthens it. Some instead argue for creating an independent state.

Vietnam points to ethnic populations in the northeast but expands its claims for strategic reasons into areas without ethnic Vietnamese populations. Vietnamese leaders argue these territories are needed to secure the country against neighbors and Chinese groups.

Cambodia makes a similar claim to Thailand, as many Khmer people live in disputed areas, especially in the south. However, they are from different ethnic groups, leading to arguments for an independent state. Cambodia also has the least stable government of the three, raising concerns that annexation would not improve living standards.

Some believe the CoN should not interfere and let the three countries resolve the issue themselves. In this case, however, the risk of conflict is much higher.

So the initial options are:

* **Support someone's claims;**
* **Not interfere.**

If the CoN chooses to interfere, the options are:

* **Support Thailand's claims the most;**
* **Support Vietnamese claims the most;**
* **Support Cambodia's claims the most;**
* **Find a compromise.**

# Mongolia & Jinyu

https://preview.redd.it/wpa2p2wtjqcg1.png?width=1289&format=png&auto=webp&s=7612578544d3aca0882ed3205da1f4a274a282fb

Mongolian people revolted even before the September 11th Incident, but gained a massive boost after it. The Mongolian State was established days after 9/11 and already controls large territory populated by Mongolians. The main issue is that it is not democratic, but a mix of military junta and oligarchy. Militarily establishing democracy is out of the question. The decision is whether to recognise the Mongolian State as sovereign.

Recognition could establish good diplomatic relations between the CoN and the MS. It would allow the CoN to use soft power to introduce limited freedoms and possibly push the country toward democracy in the future. Abstaining from recognition has advantages as well. If the CoN does not recognise Mongolian independence, it would help Chinese allies in their efforts to unify China by reclaiming “rogue states.”

So on the matter of Mongolian independence the options are:

* **Recognise the Mongolian State;**
* **Not recognise the Mongolian State.**

Closely tied to Mongolia is the question of Jinyu. Jinyu people are a Chinese minority far from other minority regions. They revolted against Japanese rule and are now in a tense situation with the Mongolian State. Mongolians claim Jinyu as part of their country, while Jinyu, which has a more democratic government, claims independence from both China and Mongolia. The situation is delicate.

The first option is to recognise Jinyu as a sovereign country and guarantee its independence. This could create a small democratic CoN ally and deter a Mongolian attack. However, it risks conflict with the Mongolian State.

The second option is to recognise Jinyu’s independence without guarantees. This avoids direct conflict with Mongolia, but may not prevent an attack.

The third option is to recognise Jinyu as part of the Mongolian State. This would improve relations with the MS and prevent armed conflict. However, it goes against the wishes of most Jinyu people and sacrifices a potential democratic ally for an authoritarian one.

The final option is to stay away and let the situation play out. This would likely result in the Mongolian State absorbing Jinyu, but could later allow Chinese Republican Forces to take the territory. This avoids blame, saves resources, and supports CoN allies.

So on the Jinyu question the options are:

* **Recognise Jinyu’s independence and guarantee it;**
* **Recognise Jinyu’s independence only;**
* **Recognise Jinyu as part of the Mongolian State;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Tibet

https://preview.redd.it/zxf9km2yjqcg1.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2ea34d2410fd9bfdadef2d95a6cfa56c70510ff

Tibet gained de facto independence after the collapse of Japanese authority, but its status remains uncertain. The Tibetan government controls most of the region and seeks international recognition. However, its political system is deeply religious and not democratic, raising concerns among some CoN members.

One option is to recognise Tibetan independence. This would create a stable buffer state and reduce immediate conflict. Recognition could also allow limited diplomatic pressure toward reform.

Another option is to delay or deny recognition. This would align with Chinese Republican claims and avoid encouraging separatism, but risks unrest or future conflict.

The final option is to stay out and let the situation develop without CoN involvement.

So the options are:

* **Recognise Tibetan independence;**
* **Not recognise Tibetan independence;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Uygur

https://preview.redd.it/xu0y0jczjqcg1.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=c019b13484ae45cb1b9181990431a89aff8f72f4

The situation of the Uygur people is similar to that of Tibet, but with key differences. Uygurs control less territory than they claim, and cooperation with India is limited, as India occupies some areas claimed by the Uygurs. There are additional disputes with neighboring states, though these are addressed separately. Despite the population being predominantly Muslim, assessments suggest extremist Islamist groups are unlikely to gain influence, limiting the range of options.

The first option is to recognise Uygur independence. This would improve CoN relations with the Uygurs and could encourage the emergence of a democratic Uygur state.

The second option is to not recognise Uygur independence. As with Tibet, this would strengthen the legitimacy of the Chinese Republican Forces, but unlike Tibet, it would not risk the territory falling under Indian control.

So the choices are:

* **Recognise Uygur independence;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Uygur–Kyrgyzstan–Tajikistan Border Dispute

https://preview.redd.it/iwrg5ce7kqcg1.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=402fde7b7de28d5b98ed39f7367e42763ba4d043

There is a territorial dispute between the Uygur state, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan along Uygur western borders and the eastern borders of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The Uygur claim is based on national unity, as most of the disputed territory has a Uygur majority. Kyrgyz and Tajik claims focus primarily on regional security.

Supporting Uygur claims would strengthen relations with the young Uygur state but damage ties with more established regional powers.

Fully supporting Tajikistan is effectively off the table, as many CoN members remain angered by Tajik assistance to Japan during the invasion of Afghanistan. Supporting Kyrgyzstan, however, is an option. This would secure a CoN-aligned partner in Central Asia but would do little to improve relations with the Uygurs.

A third option is to support a compromise solution, in which each side gains some territory without fully satisfying any claim. This approach avoids alienating any party but produces limited strategic gains.

So the choices are:

* **Support Uygur claims;**
* **Support Kyrgyzstan’s claims;**
* **Support a compromise solution;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Kazakhstan–Mongolian–Uygur Border Dispute

https://preview.redd.it/wbi7zjiakqcg1.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebd68c6f9bab5132391b42ca4a4ca474cfb3d1b0

This dispute involves the Uygur state, Kazakhstan, and the Mongolian State. Uygur claims are based on ethnic unification, as many Uygurs live in the disputed areas. Kazakhstan argues both ethnic unity and territorial security. Mongolian claims are smaller and focus mainly on security, though some ethnic Mongolians live in the region.

Fully supporting Uygur claims would give them most of the territory, improving relations with the Uygur state while harming ties with Kazakhstan and Mongolia.

Fully supporting Kazakhstan would significantly strengthen a potential future EU-aligned partner but would damage relations with Uygurs and Mongolians.

Supporting Mongolian claims effectively results in a limited compromise, pleasing the Mongolian State but leaving the other two dissatisfied. Even without recognising Mongolia, its claims would persist through Chinese Republican positions.

So the choices are:

* **Fully support Uygur claims;**
* **Fully support Kazakhstan’s claims;**
* **Support a compromise solution;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Yunnan Territorial Dispute

https://preview.redd.it/7f3ucz5dkqcg1.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f0d86513d0c9e51c581c4c7d2497ef9332e6a10

This dispute concerns Tibet and the Chinese states. India occupies the western part of the territory and is unlikely to relinquish it, leaving the CoN to decide which remaining claims to support.

The Republican Forces claim the entire region, and supporting them would fully align with their vision of Chinese unification. However, this would damage relations with Tibet and the southern Chinese minority states, making this dispute part of the broader choice between the Republican and Hainan visions for China.

Supporting the Hainan vision would mean recognising Tibetan and Chinese minority claims instead. This would strengthen relations with Tibet and support diplomatic unification, but would reduce CoN influence over the Republican Forces.

The final option is to stay out of the dispute entirely.

So the options are:

* **Fully support Republican claims;**
* **Support Tibetan and Chinese minority claims;**
* **Not interfere.**

# North-Western Sichuan Dispute

https://preview.redd.it/vzl6lc3fkqcg1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=350f1eb47769549623678b37005632ed9a56268d

This is a smaller dispute between Tibet and the Republican Forces. The situation closely mirrors the Yunnan dispute, but without the involvement of Chinese minority states, making it more straightforward.

So the options are:

* **Support Republican claims;**
* **Support Tibetan claims;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Mongolia–Tibet–Republican–Uygur Dispute

https://preview.redd.it/s3zgot9hkqcg1.png?width=1459&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0402e44d397fb5a2cae88f3fde3b4842adced66

This is a four-sided dispute involving the Mongolian State, Tibetan authorities, the Republican Forces, and the Uygurs. Mongolian claims are based on ethnic Mongolians in the region and former Jinyu claims, which the Mongolian State continues to press despite Jinyu backing away. Tibetan claims are primarily strategic, as few Tibetans live in the area. Republican claims stem from both Chinese unification goals and the presence of Han Chinese populations. Uygur claims are ethnic, as many Uygurs live in the disputed territory.

Supporting Mongolian claims would only make sense if the CoN recognises the Mongolian State. It would improve relations with Mongolia but severely damage relations with the Republican Forces and overlap with their claims.

Supporting Republican claims would reinforce Chinese unification and Han consolidation, but would antagonise Mongolia and negatively affect relations with Tibet and Uygurs.

Supporting Tibetan claims would strengthen CoN influence in Tibet and counter Indian influence, but would significantly anger the Uygurs due to overlapping claims.

Supporting Uygur claims would improve relations with the Uygurs but damage ties with Tibet.

A compromise solution would require significant effort and would not fully satisfy any side.

Finally, the CoN could stay out, avoiding diplomatic overreach but gaining little influence.

So the choices are:

* **Support Mongolian claims;**
* **Support Republican claims;**
* **Support Tibetan claims;**
* **Support Uygur claims;**
* **Support a compromise solution;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Manchuria

Manchuria is one of the most delicate issues on the table. It borders Korea, the Republican Forces, and the Mongolian State, and contains large populations of ethnic Japanese, non-Han Chinese minorities, and mixed communities. Unlike most of the former Empire, Manchuria enjoyed a degree of autonomy in the later years of Japanese rule, leading to unusually high ethnic tolerance and integration. Any solution must account for this diversity.

One proposal is to divide Manchuria among neighboring states: portions to the Republican Forces, Korea, and Mongolia. While this could reduce immediate tensions, it fails to protect Japanese and mixed populations and satisfies no party.

Another option is to give most of Manchuria to the Republican Forces to support Chinese unification. This would create a strong CoN ally but risks severe ethnic tensions involving Japanese, Koreans, minorities, and mixed communities.

A third option is to award most of the region to Korea, partly as a reward for its rapid liberation and relative tolerance of Japanese minorities. This would almost certainly provoke conflict with the Republican Forces.

A fourth proposal is to place Manchuria under the Hainan Republic. As the CoN’s longest-standing ally in the region, Hainan’s diplomatic and minority-focused approach could manage ethnic tensions better than others and avoid open conflict with the Republicans. However, governance would be difficult due to distance, would require substantial aid, and could strain relations with Korea.

The final and most controversial option is to establish an independent Manchurian state. Given the region’s diversity, local self-rule could be viable and would create a CoN-aligned buffer between Korea and China. However, the state could collapse, be exploited by neighbors, or require extensive long-term support.

So the options are:

* **Compromised division;**
* **Give Manchuria to the Republican Forces;**
* **Give Manchuria to Korea;**
* **Give Manchuria to the Hainan Republic;**
* **Establish an independent Manchurian state.**

# Mongolia–Republican Dispute

https://preview.redd.it/10f4f1rokqcg1.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=cacdc7410fd8c1a17155d40aa19f6f1ff549b6ce

This is a localized dispute between the Mongolian State and the Republican Forces along Mongolia’s southern border and China’s northern territories. As with many other cases, the conflict is driven primarily by ethnic composition and security concerns.

Supporting Mongolian claims would improve relations with the Mongolian State but damage ties with the Republican Forces.

Supporting Republican claims would favor a stronger CoN-aligned partner in China, at the cost of worsening relations with Mongolia.

A compromise solution would divide the territory, avoiding major escalation but leaving both sides dissatisfied.

Finally, the CoN could stay out of the dispute. Given its limited scale, non-interference would avoid alienating either side and allow focus on higher-priority regions.

So the options are:

* **Support Mongolian claims;**
* **Support Republican claims;**
* **Support a compromise solution;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Nemets

https://preview.redd.it/i7hiuhdqkqcg1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e6e6c19b25ed5243ad10f3f76a25a5995a69850

The Nemets did not mount large-scale resistance against Japanese rule, as Imperial forces largely withdrew when the Empire collapsed. As a result, there is no strong or unified movement for an independent Nemets state. The region lacks major population centers, and communities are small and widely dispersed. Establishing an independent country would require extensive CoN investment.

One option is to commit resources to building an independent Nemets state. Even with heavy aid, its long-term stability and resistance to foreign influence are uncertain.

The alternative is the Russian solution. President Garry Kasparov proposes incorporating the territory into the Russian Republic. Russia controlled the area before Japanese occupation, there are no competing claims, and this option would empower a CoN member while resolving governance issues.

So the options are:

* **Attempt to establish an independent Nemets state;**
* **Give the land to the Russian Republic.**

# Eni-shuku, Ensei, Anegawa, Koshū, and Magata

https://preview.redd.it/c88sizk1mqcg1.png?width=1759&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9548ef8dec4322e4ab363bcceececfaefef8088

These territories share a similar situation. Eni-shuku (Yeniseisk), Ensei (Krasnoyarsk), Anegawa (Bratsk), and Koshū (Irkutsk) were left behind when Japanese forces withdrew, with no local independence movements emerging. The population is overwhelmingly ethnic Russian, with small Japanese, Chinese, and in Koshū’s case Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities. Magata (Magadan) is the easternmost territory and has a larger Indigenous population, but Russians still form the majority.

The most straightforward solution is to transfer all these territories to the Russian Republic. This would strengthen a CoN member, satisfy the majority population, and resolve administrative uncertainty.

An alternative proposal, mainly supported by Eastern European CoN members, is to create new independent states. One version suggests a united state of Eni-shuku, Ensei, Anegawa, and Koshū, with Magata forming a separate country. This would limit Russian expansion but would require massive investment and is widely seen as unsustainable, as the population would likely favor eventual union with Russia anyway.

Each region is therefore addressed separately.

For **Eni-shuku, Ensei, Anegawa, and Koshū**, the options are:

* **Give the land to the Russian Republic;**
* **Attempt to establish a united independent state.**

For **Magata**, the options are:

* **Give the land to the Russian Republic;**
* **Attempt to establish an independent state.**

# Tanu Tuva

https://preview.redd.it/diz7hnrskqcg1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=624cc17127b9915b86ca6154ba8d10534c16e4f6

Tanu Tuva is claimed by the Russian Republic, but unlike many northern territories, it has a majority indigenous population. Tuvans resisted Japanese rule early in the Empire’s collapse, though the region was not a Japanese priority and was abandoned after the September 11 Incident.

One option is to incorporate Tanu Tuva into the Russian Republic. This would strengthen a CoN member and require no additional CoN aid, but would ignore local independence sentiment.

The alternative is to support Tanu Tuvan independence. This could create a new CoN-aligned state, but would strain relations with Russia and require significant long-term assistance. It is also unclear whether a democratic system would gain majority support.

So the options are:

* **Give the land to the Russian Republic;**
* **Support Tanu Tuvan independence.**

# Altai Republic–Khakassia–Tanu Tuva Dispute

https://preview.redd.it/ezobpkwukqcg1.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=d053a1d0b18008b81c246e51346cdfc1ae2224f7

Regardless of Tanu Tuva’s final status, the territorial dispute between it, the Altai Republic, and Khakassia must be addressed. The dispute is rooted in mixed ethnic settlement, with Altai, Khakas, and Tuvan populations spread across the area and no clear majority.

Relations between the CoN and both the Altai Republic and Khakassia have deteriorated due to their increasingly authoritarian governments, making full support for either unlikely. Kazakhstan and the Mongolian State border the region but make no claims, simplifying the situation.

One option is to support Tanu Tuvan claims. This would either strengthen a newly independent Tanu Tuva or help unite all Tuvans under the Russian Republic, depending on earlier decisions.

Another option is a compromise solution that respects ethnic distribution and formally defines borders. This could reduce future conflict but risks reigniting ethnic tensions if mishandled.

The final option is non-interference. This avoids responsibility and blame but limits CoN influence in the region.

So the options are:

* **Support Tanu Tuvan claims;**
* **Support a compromise solution;**
* **Not interfere.**

# Taiwan

https://preview.redd.it/2wjqzcbwkqcg1.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=43ebe9141fd0e2e33d47460eb8db1b0a870ca933

Taiwan served as a key strategic hub for the Empire of Japan, and its revolt was widely seen as a turning point in the collapse of Japanese control over China. Now liberated, the island must decide its future amid competing claims. Taiwan’s population is ethnically diverse, including Han Chinese, Chinese minorities, and Japanese communities.

Supporting Taiwanese independence would reflect this distinct identity and geographic separation from the mainland. However, the island is currently ruled by a general, and it is uncertain how quickly or willingly power would be transferred to a democratic government.

Supporting the Republican Forces’ claim would reinforce their vision of a unified China and could ease the transition, as the current leadership is Han Chinese. This option would strengthen Han dominance at the expense of minorities.

The Hainan Republic’s claim offers the most diplomatic approach. Hainan’s emphasis on ethnic tolerance aligns well with Taiwan’s diversity, but stabilising the island would require accommodating its current leadership and could prove risky.

So the options are:

* **Support Taiwanese independence;**
* **Support the Republican Forces’ claim;**
* **Support the Hainan Republic’s claim.**

(RECAP) Trump's Actions in Venezuela were ILLEGAL!!! | Lichtman Live #194,1q98c0e,1,0,2026-01-10 16:24:45,PrivateFM,13KeysToTheWhiteHouse,"**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/live/EpDZ6MXX-5g](https://www.youtube.com/live/EpDZ6MXX-5g)

*\*If you find any inaccuracies in this summary, please don't hesitate to let me know and I'll make the necessary corrections accordingly.*

**Discussion**

* Professor Lichtman opened the stream on the fifth anniversary of the January 6th Capitol attacks by highlighting the explosive recent testimony of Special Counsel Jack Smith, who appeared before Congress on New Year's Eve. Smith’s testimony confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results and prevent the peaceful transfer of power. Lichtman argued that Trump is actively attempting to rewrite this history, transforming a violent insurrection into a patriotic event by pardoning rioters under the false pretense that they were denied due process. The Professor drew a sharp parallel between these pardons and Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, a figure Lichtman identified as one of history's most notorious drug traffickers. Hernández had been convicted in US federal court for facilitating the importation of over 400 tons of cocaine into the United States, utilizing the Honduran military and police force to protect drug shipments. Lichtman emphasized that, contrary to Trump’s claims of unfair treatment, Hernández had received full due process during his prosecution, making his pardon a blatant act of rewriting history to justify criminal behavior.
* The conversation shifted to the Trump administration's declaration that it is now running Venezuela, a claim Lichtman dismantled by pointing out that Maduro's vice president was recently sworn in alongside delegations from American adversaries like Iran, Russia, and China. Lichtman condemned the administration's labeling of this intervention as a military operation and law enforcement mission, asserting these actions are illegal, immoral, and historically illiterate. He provided a detailed historical critique of US interventions, noting that toppling dictators often leads to worse outcomes, such as the power vacuum following Saddam Hussein's removal in Iraq, the chaos after Muammar Gaddafi's fall in Libya, and the rise of the brutal Pinochet dictatorship in Chile after the US-backed coup against the democratically elected Salvador Allende. He also referenced the 1954 US intervention in Guatemala, which overthrew the democratically elected government of Jacobo Árbenz and ultimately led to a decades-long civil war and the Silent Holocaust, a genocide against the Mayan people. Lichtman warned that the current resource extraction operation in Venezuela lacks any plan for governance and is purely motivated by oil interests.
* Lichtman and Sam discussed the administration's failure to secure international support for the Venezuela operation, noting that the United Nations Security Council and key NATO allies like Spain, France, and Denmark have openly condemned or refused to support the move. The Professor compared the administration's military operation rhetoric to Vladimir Putin’s use of terms like ""special military operation"" to justify the invasion of Ukraine, arguing that bombing a country and removing its leader constitutes an act of war regardless of the terminology used. They also highlighted the logistical absurdity of the operation, observing that major oil companies are reluctant to invest in Venezuela due to the political instability, prompting Trump to suggest using taxpayer money to subsidize these corporations—a move Lichtman contrasted with the administration's simultaneous cuts to social safety nets like Medicaid and food stamps.
* The discussion expanded to the administration's aggressive foreign policy rhetoric regarding Greenland, specifically Stephen Miller's assertion that the United States has a claim to the territory equal to that of Denmark. Lichtman refuted this by outlining Greenland's political evolution from a Danish colony in the 18th century to its integration into the Danish realm in 1953, the granting of home rule in 1979, and its achievement of self-government in 2009. He argued that Trump is misapplying the Monroe Doctrine—which was originally designed to prevent European colonization in the Western Hemisphere—to justify a new doctrine that essentially claims the US can seize territory at will. Lichtman warned that threatening a NATO ally like Denmark with a military takeover could shatter the alliance, as Article 5 of the NATO charter stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all.
* Lichtman analyzed the sudden withdrawal of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz from his gubernatorial reelection campaign, a move driven by Republicans effectively tying his administration to the Feeding Our Future scandal, a massive scheme involving the misappropriation of federal food aid intended for children. Lichtman noted that the Trump administration is using this controversy as a pretext to freeze ten billion dollars in social service funding for five Democratic-led states. The Professor further argued that this crackdown is specifically designed to target the Somali community in Minnesota, contrasting this aggressive enforcement with President Trump's history of pardoning white criminals who have committed similar financial crimes, thus exposing a racially biased double standard in the administration's application of justice.
* Lichtman criticized the Pentagon's newly announced review of the effectiveness of women in ground combat roles, characterizing it not as a good-faith inquiry but as a smokescreen orchestrated by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ultimately remove women from these positions. The Professor pointed to Hegseth's past record of explicitly stating women should not serve in combat and highlighted the hypocrisy of the administration threatening Senator Mark Kelly’s military rank and pension for reminding troops they are not required to follow illegal orders—a stance Hegseth himself had publicly supported in 2016.
* Finally, the Professor expressed deep frustration with the Department of Justice's failure to meet the deadline for releasing the Epstein files, noting that less than one percent of the documents have been produced despite previous claims that they were ready for release. Lichtman accused the administration of a combination of laziness, stupidity, and malice, pointing out the contradiction in Attorney General Pam Bondi’s earlier assertion that the files were on her desk versus her later claim that they did not exist, suggesting a deliberate effort to bury the information to protect political allies while exclusively investigating Democrats.

**Q&A Highlights**

**1. Explanation of BRICS and Its Relation to the Capture of Maduro:**  
Professor Lichtman described BRICS as an alliance of nations that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. He explained that these nations have been highly critical of the Trump administration's intervention in Venezuela and suggested that the operation against Maduro is part of a wider effort to destabilize this bloc of nations, pointing to the administration's other attempts to exclude South Africa from international meetings and its military aggressions against Iran. He characterized this foreign policy as a kind of low-budget version of the axis of evil, aimed at undermining any country that challenges American dominance.

**2. Possibility of Future Military Moves Against Colombia, Cuba, and Greenland:**  
Professor Lichtman warned that the military operation in Venezuela is likely not a one-time event but rather the beginning of a broader policy of aggression. He cited rhetoric from both Donald Trump and senior advisor Stephen Miller indicating potential actions against other nations, including Colombia, Cuba, and even Greenland. Lichtman described this approach as a smash and grab strategy focused on resource seizure and projecting power. While he noted it is impossible to know if these threats will materialize, he stressed that the administration's stated intentions suggest further military interventions are a real possibility.

**3. Comparison of US Monetary Aid in Iraq to Venezuela and Oil Company Investment:**  
Professor Lichtman affirmed the parallel between the potential situation in Venezuela and the aftermath of the Iraq War, where the US spent vast sums to stabilize a deteriorating society. He expressed strong doubts that major oil companies would willingly invest in rebuilding Venezuela's infrastructure, given that corporations prioritize stability and certainty above all else. Lichtman highlighted the profound hypocrisy of the administration proposing to use American taxpayer money to subsidize some of the world's richest corporations while simultaneously cutting essential domestic programs like Medicaid and food stamps. He concluded that it is unlikely even the current Republican-controlled House would approve such funding, and it would have zero chance if Democrats regain control.

**4. Impact of Educating the Public on the Draft and Its Potential Reinstatement:**  
Professor Lichtman stated he would be profoundly shocked if the military draft were to be reinstated. He explained that the draft, which has not been used since the Nixon administration ended it in 1973, is now considered politically toxic. While he acknowledged from his personal experience of being drafted during the Vietnam War that conscription can powerfully galvanize anti-war movements, he argued that the immense political backlash any modern president or Congress would face makes its return almost unimaginable.

**5. Venezuelan Action Signifying Peak Oil and the Logic of Invasion:**  
Professor Lichtman firmly rejected the idea that invading Venezuela signals that the world is running out of oil. He pointed out that the United States is a net exporter of oil and has no desperate need for Venezuela's specific type of heavy crude. He argued that the administration's true motivation is its commitment to expanding the use of fossil fuels, in direct defiance of overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. Lichtman cited the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as bomb cyclones and massive wildfires, as proof that the planet is nearing a tipping point, making the administration's actions a dangerous pursuit of plunder.

**6. Parallels Between Stephen Miller Running Venezuela and Paul Bremer in Iraq:**  
Professor Lichtman fully endorsed the comparison between Stephen Miller potentially governing Venezuela and L. Paul Bremer's disastrous administration of post-invasion Iraq. He called the notion of placing an incompetent and immoral figure like Miller in charge of a nation of nearly 30 million people a recipe for catastrophe. Lichtman explained that Bremer's key decisions in Iraq, such as disbanding the Iraqi army and purging Ba'ath party members from government, directly fueled the insurgency and chaos that followed. He held up this history as a critical cautionary tale that the current administration is foolishly ignoring.

**7. Strategies for Legitimate Political Opposition and the Demonization of Progressives:**  
Professor Lichtman advised Democrats to study Harry Truman’s successful 1948 presidential campaign as a model for combating accusations of socialism. He detailed how Truman, despite being written off by pundits and attacked as a leftist, embarked on a nationwide grassroots whistle-stop train tour. On this tour, Truman directly attacked the unproductive do-nothing Congress and passionately advocated for progressive policies like national health reform, affordable housing, and civil rights. Lichtman urged today's Democrats to stop being defensive and instead proudly campaign on their historic achievements, such as Social Security and the Affordable Care Act.

**8. Comparing Trump’s Actions to Andrew Jackson’s Trail of Tears and Polk’s Manifest Destiny:**  
Professor Lichtman agreed that Trump’s actions are on a similar moral level as some of the darkest chapters in American history. He specifically compared them to Andrew Jackson’s forced removal of Native Americans on the Trail of Tears and James K. Polk’s instigation of the Mexican-American War. However, Lichtman drew a crucial distinction: while Polk's war, though racist and aggressive, resulted in a massive expansion of US territory, including California and the Southwest, Trump's actions offer no such strategic or tangible benefit to the country. They are purely destructive, creating chaos with no positive outcome.

**9. Democratic Failure to Highlight Student Loan Garnishments:**  
Professor Lichtman concurred that Democrats should be making the issue of student loan garnishments a major focus. He framed the administration's policy as a punitive attack on ordinary Americans who sought to better themselves through education, many of whom were victims of predatory for-profit colleges. He contrasted this harsh stance against student borrowers with the administration's willingness to provide enormous financial benefits and tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations, arguing this stark hypocrisy is a powerful political issue that Democrats are failing to exploit.

**10. Likelihood of a Coalition Imposing Sanctions on the US and Global Economic Impact:**  
Professor Lichtman explained that a broad international coalition is highly unlikely to impose sanctions on the United States, despite global outrage at its actions. The reason, he stated, is that the US economy is the largest and most central to the global financial system. He argued that any attempt to sanction the United States would trigger a devastating worldwide economic collapse. This reality serves as a powerful deterrent, forcing even the most critical allies to moderate their responses and avoid direct economic confrontation.

**11. Odds of Trump Remaining in Power Until the End of His Term Amidst Scandals:**  
Professor Lichtman suggested that Trump’s hold on power is showing signs of weakening. He pointed to polling on the Venezuela intervention, which has less than 40 percent support and has failed to produce the expected rally-around-the-flag effect seen in past military conflicts. He believes that while a politically motivated removal from office is improbable because the Senate would never convict him, the most significant threat to Trump serving his full term is his personal health.

**12. Historical View of Trump’s Reelection After January 6th and Comparable Controversies:**  
Professor Lichtman asserted that there is no historical precedent for a US president being reelected after a controversy on the scale of January 6th. He reviewed major presidential scandals like the Teapot Dome scandal and Watergate, noting a consistent pattern: these events either occurred during a president's second term or led directly to their resignation or decision not to seek reelection. He concluded that Trump’s political survival and return to power after inciting an insurrection is a unique event in American history, making its long-term perception difficult to predict.

**13. Psychology Behind the Republican Obsession with Conspiracy Theories:**  
Professor Lichtman, while clarifying he is not a psychologist, explained that conspiracy theories are appealing because they offer simple explanations for complex problems and consistently blame an external group or other. This allows believers to avoid self-reflection or responsibility. He noted that these theories frequently target groups like immigrants, feminists, and Jews. To illustrate the mindset, he told a joke from the Weimar Republic about a rabbi who preferred reading a Nazi newspaper because, unlike the Jewish press which detailed persecution, the Nazi paper claimed Jews secretly controlled the world, offering a perverse sense of power.

**14. Consequences if the Supreme Court Guts the Voting Rights Act:**  
Professor Lichtman described a potential Supreme Court decision to gut the Voting Rights Act as a body blow to American democracy. He reminded the audience that President Ronald Reagan called the Act the crown jewel of American law because it finally dismantled the Jim Crow systems that had disenfranchised Black voters for a century. Lichtman warned that nullifying this law would be a tragic step backward, reopening the door to discriminatory voting practices and severely damaging the principle of one person, one vote.

**15. Congressional Actions to Prevent Another Insurrection:**  
Professor Lichtman stated that the current Republican-controlled Congress is doing nothing to prevent a future insurrection, largely because its members have embraced the false narrative that January 6th was a patriotic protest. He did, however, credit the previous Congress with taking a meaningful step by passing the Electoral Count Reform Act. He explained that this law clarified that the Vice President's role in counting electoral votes is purely ceremonial and significantly raised the threshold for members of Congress to object to a state's certified results, thereby strengthening the process against future attempts at subversion.

**16. Potential Coverage of the 2026 Quebec Election:**  
In response to a viewer's question, Professor Lichtman expressed interest in potentially covering the 2026 Quebec election. He mentioned his fondness for Quebec from his travels there and said that, having been alerted to the upcoming election, he would keep it on his radar and possibly discuss it as it draws closer.

**17. California Voting to Join Denmark and European Fear of Trump:**  
Professor Lichtman used a viewer's satirical question about California joining Denmark to address the genuine and profound fear among European allies regarding the Trump administration. He explained that the threat to take over Greenland has created an unprecedented rift within NATO. If the US were to act, it could theoretically trigger Article 5 of the NATO charter, placing member nations in the impossible position of having to defend Denmark, a fellow member, against the United States, the leader of the alliance. This potential for the complete collapse of the Western security alliance is a source of terror in European capitals.

**18. Role of Hugo Chavez Versus Maduro in Venezuela’s Economic Collapse:**  
Professor Lichtman laid the blame for Venezuela's economic ruin on both Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro. He explained that Chavez initiated the country's decline with policies that weakened the vital oil industry and eroded democratic institutions. Maduro, he continued, then took a bad situation and made it catastrophically worse, accelerating the economic mismanagement and intensifying the authoritarian crackdown into a full-blown dictatorship.

**19. Public Support for Regime Change Compared to the Truman Presidency:**

Professor Lichtman stated unequivocally that American public opinion no longer supports the kind of interventionist regime-change policies that were common during the early Cold War. He used polling data showing that over 70 percent of Americans oppose the US taking over the governance of Venezuela as concrete proof of this shift. He contrasted this modern sentiment with the broad support President Truman received for his policies of containing communism, highlighting how much the public's appetite for foreign intervention has diminished.

**20. Viability of Venezuelan Oil and Trump as a Power Bully:**  
Professor Lichtman confirmed that Venezuelan oil presents significant logistical challenges, as it is a heavy crude that is difficult to extract and requires specialized refineries. He also referenced expert opinions that it could take anywhere from two to ten years to restore its production. For these reasons, he agreed with the analysis that the intervention is less about a practical plan to secure oil and more about Donald Trump acting as a power bully on the world stage. He concluded that the entire operation has the hallmarks of a Wag the Dog scenario: a manufactured foreign crisis intended to distract voters from pressing domestic issues like the struggling job market and rising healthcare premiums.

**Conclusion**

Professor Lichtman concluded the livestream by urging viewers to remain vigilant. He framed the current period of unprecedented political chaos and international aggression not as a peak, but as the very start of a new, turbulent era, advising viewers that what we are witnessing is merely the beginning of the beginning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/13KeysToTheWhiteHouse/comments/1q98c0e/recap_trumps_actions_in_venezuela_were_illegal/
A Simplified History of the Indian Subcontinent,1q8gxby,2,0,2026-01-09 18:56:47,Accurate-Self7608,EuroAsianMix,"The first humans in the Indian subcontinent came from Africa. Many thousands of years later, Iranians arrived and interbred with them. Out of this emerged the Indus civilisation, one of the oldest civilisations in the world. Over time, it declined, as power is never eternal and always shifts. At that stage, Aryans from Eastern Europe arrived. They were superior to the declining civilisation, and so the Indus civilisation was absorbed into the Aryan, creating a new civilisation which was a synthesis of the two, known as the Dharmic civilisation. Interbreeding also took place during this period.

Many years later, those in positions of power established the caste system, which became the largest institutionalised form of racism in human history. Those with higher Aryan bloodlines were placed in the upper castes, while those with a greater percentage of Indus ancestry were relegated to the lower castes. This has been demonstrated through both historical and genetic studies.

Centuries later, groups from East Asia, Central Asia, and West Asia entered the subcontinent. During this period, another civilisation, the Islamic civilisation, was introduced. Eventually, Europeans arrived, bringing with them Western civilisation. Finally, the British conquered the subcontinent and created a single administrative zone.

After the First and Second World Wars, Britain lost its former power. At the same time, the people of the subcontinent demanded power for themselves. As a result, India, along with West and East Pakistan, was founded. Later, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan.

India, which was founded 79 years ago, adopted the Colonial System of the UK instead of the UK System. Then it also incorporated elements of the Soviet Union’s model. Instead of adopting French secularism, it adopted anti-secularism, neutrality, and not adoption of modernising like the Japanese during the Meiji era, resulting in a failed socialist state called India.

Then our neighbour Pakistan’s founder wanted a secular, westernised country, but due to many reasons it became Islamicised and is now run by military dictatorship. It is also a failed state.

Then our other neighbour Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan with India’s help. Many years later, it experienced growth, but corruption persisted. Following protests, the country destabilised, radicalised into an Islamic nation, and became another failed state.

These countries give us a valuable lesson in how not to build a country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroAsianMix/comments/1q8gxby/a_simplified_history_of_the_indian_subcontinent/

"What if there was a new World order Bloc, without the USA and Israel, with no other religious state led countries, or dictatorships either - Military and Economic Bloc.",1q7t5jc,0,13,2026-01-09 00:26:07,Telinoz,whatif,"Recent events around USA threatening allies, NATO members, has led to a lot of discussions about the current World order. NATO, UN etc. Stating that allies cannot survive without the USA - Russia rolls Europe and China is more of a threat elsewhere to other allies outside of NATO countries.

What if there was a new World order, a new Bloc formed for Military and Economic reasons that set to ensure a new stronger more Global Bloc without the USA or Israel.

The attached images in the comments, and this post detail a possible Bloc that could be made.

  
Selection criteria, and explanations;

I used Freedom in the World Ratings website, Freedom House, with their Free, Partly Free and Not Free ratings.

This was to ensure, no dictatorship countries or territories make it to the Bloc, this just so happens to cover religious state led countries that are not free. Civil rights, political rights, Women's rights, minority rights etc.

I then sourced GDP data, to focus on economic side of things - and it just happens to be that the most global set of data is 2023 as most recent years is still being gathered.

Same with population data, as I wanted to see how that balanced out for potential forces for economic and military reasons.

UN lists countries, but I also wanted to add in territories as well that have their own voting rights, economy and GDP data, as in some cases you want territories to be in the Bloc for strategic reasons.



The new Bloc, must have a similar article 5 style clause - attack one, attack all - Otherwise the whole point on proving that the developed World can do without USA and Israel is lost... 

That applies to China as well, you will see I would add and recognise Taiwan as well, this is not just about Europe being stronger, but adding a deterrent to China as well.



Based on that, I grouped all countries and territories into 4 categories;

B - Bloc, added to the new World order Bloc - full access support, military and Free trade agreements for economic support.

N - A Neutral country, not in the Bloc, but some support for Military exercises and no limits for economic interactions

D - Denylist - Zero military support, sharing of tech, intelligence - and regulated, sanction economic interactions with the aim of cutting ties as soon as possible and find different supply chain solutions.

H - Hostile - No economic interactions, and obviously no military support or exercises.

  
The % of GDP spending for a Military Budget for the Bloc, which would be in addition to each countries spending, creates a decent budget for a Bloc Army as well.

Combined manufacturing, technology, a series of Bloc standard Military hardware can be made all the way up to an Nuclear Aircraft carrier - and, for those, I selected 6 carriers in bases at strategic points around the World which are detailed in the table notes and on the World map I made.

This is theory crafting ok, so timelines would be a minimum decade for most of it to be done, but key countries if USA drops out / kicked out of NATO could be sorted out in less than a year.

I also added a Map showing all approx 750 to 780 USA bases in other countries around the World, these would all have to go, and be replaced with new Bloc bases and soldiers.

  
As you can see, USA remains Neutral and the guidelines above apply - this is assuming they calm down and re-direct from their current path of threats to Canada, Greenland etc and other countries that are current allies.

  
The last part of the What if, adds in two more variations, India and Brazil.

I added a small sub-table, that shows what happens if India moves from Neutral to Bloc Status, and then another one that shows India AND Brazil moving to Bloc status.

I was curious to see what tips the balance in favour for the new Bloc for both GDP and Population.

This essentially creates a new World Order, split into 3 groups.

1.  The New Bloc

2. USA + Israel

3. Russia, China, Iran - pretty much the current hostile countries to existing alliances

  
vs. The two main groups at the moment, but with USA pretty much Veto everything amongst allies and thinking it can do whatever it wants, that needs to change.

  
At this point, it doesn't show Military hardware, troop counts, etc per country and that would take another few weeks of me playing around to work that out, as much fun as this theory crafting has been during the holidays with a few beers, I will leave that to a later time.. but, there are plenty of comparison websites, threads, YouTube videos on this as this topic of NATO without USA and how that would work for Military hardware is discussed a lot... 

Last thing, Global currency would change within these countries from the US dollar, going away from USA also means this has to change as well... likely pick would be the EURO as it is already in the bulk of the major countries in this new Bloc and a strong currency.

Failed Precedents and Painful Consequences of Radical Extremism and Perfectionism: Taking Communist Revolutions, Excessive “Political Correctness,” the 1989 Democracy Movement / June Fourth Incident, and the Hong Kong Anti–Extradition Bill Movement as Examples

Moreover, excessive radicalism and an insistence on perfect, thorough solutions often produce the effect of “going too far and achieving the opposite.” Typical examples include the socialist and communist revolutions and subsequent construction that took place around the world in the twentieth century. In contrast to the hierarchical oppression of feudal societies and the brutal coldness of capitalist societies, socialism and communism were beautiful visions aimed at human equality and happiness, and were indeed worthy of pursuit.

Yet in the Soviet Union, China, Eastern Europe, and even Cambodia, various enormous tragedies occurred in the name of building socialist societies and realizing communist ideals. An excessive emphasis on revolutionary purity led to endless political purges and rivers of blood; an obsession with the “dictatorship of the proletariat” shackled national development with dogmatism; economic policies that ignored real conditions and objective laws caused great famines and bloated industrialization; and the promotion of uncompromising class struggle resulted in the slaughter of millions of lives.

Although these tragedies had specific causes such as power struggles and interest conflicts, they were also related to the intense pursuit—at least in name—of the fundamentalist goals within Marxist–Leninist–Maoist theory. After suffering brutal far-left disasters and political struggles, many Chinese, Russians, and Eastern Europeans later turned to extremely conservative and laissez-faire far-right paths, which was itself a case of “extremes reversing” caused by earlier far-left catastrophes.

In recent years, controversies in Western countries surrounding “political correctness” have also reflected the reality that radicalism and the pursuit of perfection can provoke backlash. “Political correctness” is a product of developed societies that have accumulated extensive experience and lessons through various historical sufferings and have evolved into highly civilized societies. Specific “politically correct” norms include opposing discrimination against or mockery of ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, transgender people, and victims of crime or disasters; opposing the promotion of hatred and resentment toward particular groups; opposing the denial of historical oppression, massacres, and enslavement of Black people and Indigenous peoples in U.S. history; and acknowledging scientific conclusions in professional fields such as the reality of climate change and the correctness of evolution.

These forms of “political correctness” are necessary both emotionally and rationally, and they help protect vulnerable groups, reduce hatred, promote social harmony, and advance science. However, excessive emphasis on “political correctness” by some radical leftists and establishment figures has triggered backlash from those who resent it. Even some people who initially accepted “political correctness,” under incessant emphasis and rigid regulation—combined with real-life interpersonal conflicts and the darker aspects of human nature—gradually came to loathe it, deliberately expressing or privately endorsing views opposed to it. One reason for Donald Trump’s successful election as U.S. president was precisely his disregard for “political correctness” and his freewheeling expression of discriminatory and hateful remarks, which resonated with and attracted support from those who detested “political correctness.”

In some specific conflict events, radicalism and uncompromising thoroughness are also easily met with backlash. For example, the 1989 democracy movement had already achieved significant results, and the Chinese Communist Party had made enormous concessions that, viewed today, are almost unimaginable. At that time, support for democratization included not only figures such as CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, but even Deng Xiaoping did not strongly oppose democracy. Deng’s political stance was similar to that of János Kádár of Hungary—an enlightened pragmatist—who wavered between moving toward democracy and maintaining authoritarian rule, attempting to find a compromise that would allow partial democracy while preserving CCP dominance. Where history would head depended on changing circumstances and, especially, real-world power struggles.

At the time, both domestic public opinion (with broad support for the democracy movement across sectors) and the international environment (the peak of the third wave of democratization, with both the United States and the Soviet Union supporting China’s democratization, and democratic forces across Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa expressing solidarity) were highly favorable to China’s democratic forces. If the Tiananmen Square protests had ended peacefully, with students and people from all walks of life broadly participating in political activities and civic movements and putting the achieved consensus on political democratization into practice, China might well have undergone a democratic transition similar to that of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe later on—perhaps even with a better outcome, had cooperation between officials and the public been effective.

However, due to the intransigence of a small number of radical actors, compromise and withdrawal were not reached in time, providing hardliners within the CCP with a pretext. Deng Xiaoping also shifted to support suppression, and in the end it was like eggs striking stone: China’s subsequent historical fate was rewritten from “hope” to “darkness.”

(It is worth noting that after the June Fourth crackdown occurred, a temporary compromise was actually reached through the mediation of Liu Xiaobo and others among the so-called “Four Gentlemen of Tiananmen,” whereby students withdrew in exchange for the cessation of repression. From the perspective of protecting life and humanitarianism, this is of course beyond reproach and worthy of praise. But it also demonstrates the essential weakness of hardline forces and the cowardice behind their high-sounding rhetoric.

On the one hand, they were hardline, yet they had not thought through what to do if violent repression truly occurred—whether they dared to sacrifice themselves, and how to make such sacrifice meaningful. Had there been no compromise after the crackdown, and had students, workers, and citizens confronted repression head-on—given that many among them had intricate ties with CCP officials at all levels, including the highest—and especially if some idealistic children of high-ranking cadres, particularly those from military families, had rushed toward tanks and gunfire and been killed or wounded, thereby dragging their parents and relatives “into the water,” then after tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of casualties, the regime might indeed have hesitated, feared, softened, halted repression, or even collapsed or fled abroad.

Even if hardliners had continued repression, it might very likely have triggered splits within the ruling group and even mutinies (at the very least, those whose children, relatives, or friends died in the repression would not all have been cold-blooded and selfish), as in the Romanian case. In that scenario, even a sacrifice of 300,000 lives could arguably have been “worth it” if it secured democratic success for China, freed billions of Chinese people then and in the future from shackles, restored their rights and dignity, and left later generations to remember the courage and merit of those sacrifices as inspiration to strive forward and defend democracy.

But the actual situation of June Fourth was that, at the life-and-death moment when repression had already occurred but not escalated further, forces including hardliners and extremists instead became fearful, retreated, abandoned the idea of “using blood to open the people’s eyes,” chose to preserve their strength, wait and see, or even flee outright, rather than press on to create a turning point. As a result, hundreds to thousands died, tens of thousands were imprisoned, democratization was aborted, and the outcome was left tragically unresolved.

Such fear at the critical moment is of course understandable—bullying the weak and fearing the strong is basic human nature, and I myself have had similar experiences. But objectively speaking, this pattern—being hardline and rejecting compromise in advance, then collapsing at the first real confrontation, losing lives and prior gains—is the worst possible outcome for a struggle.

By contrast, India’s “nonviolent noncooperation” movement, which consistently adhered to peaceful, rational, nonviolent principles from the outset, saw participants face batons and gunfire from British colonial rulers, endure brutal beatings and even the killing of comrades without retreating or losing heart, and persist relentlessly until victory was achieved (of course, this was also due to differences in the opponent’s level of civilization, and the movement’s success had multiple causes rather than relying solely on “nonviolent noncooperation”).

The Hong Kong anti–extradition bill movement was similar. Setting aside whether some of its demands were reasonable, in terms of methods and outcomes alone, large-scale peaceful demonstrations had already forced the Hong Kong government to make concessions and withdraw the Extradition Bill, achieving more concrete results than the earlier “Occupy Central” movement and demonstrating to both the Hong Kong authorities and Beijing the will and power of Hong Kong citizens.

Had matters ended there, or had subsequent resistance remained peaceful and sustained, victory in parliamentary elections and other political contests would have been entirely possible (as confirmed by the results of the 2019 Hong Kong District Council elections), and greater political space could have been expanded on the basis of such public opinion and mobilization. However, the anti–extradition bill movement gradually evolved into violent acts of smashing, looting, and arson, including indiscriminate attacks on mainland Chinese people, pro-establishment individuals, and Chinese-funded or pro-establishment businesses and shops. These were not isolated incidents but became quite widespread, providing the CCP and the Hong Kong government with a pretext for repression. From the perspective of the CCP and the Hong Kong authorities, it was also impossible to tolerate large-scale violence or to compromise and retreat, as doing so would undermine authority, lead to more violence, and, for the CCP, raise concerns about imitation on the mainland.

Thus, repression became the only option, and moderate factions within the central and Hong Kong governments found it difficult to intervene. The cornered central authorities and Hong Kong government decided to quell the situation and take the opportunity to uproot democratic forces. Consequently, the machinery of violence and various public powers were fully mobilized; peaceful demonstrations and violent actions alike were suppressed; political parties and civic organizations were eradicated; and freedom of the press, speech, and academia were all destroyed. Hong Kong was left with no space for democratic or other anti-establishment forces to operate. (As for claims that even without resistance, the Xi Jinping regime would have destroyed Hong Kong’s democratic and localist forces anyway, this could indeed have happened, but it was not inevitable; even if repression had occurred, it likely would not have been as absolute as it is now. When one side is in a weaker position, it should avoid providing the other with pretexts for attack as much as possible.)

That said, whether in the case of the 1989 democracy movement or the anti–extradition bill movement, excessive radicalism and a failure to “know when to stop” were not the primary causes of failure, nor the only causes. Fundamentally, repression by the ruling group was the decisive factor. And even if compromise had been made, it might not necessarily have been met with compromise in return.

The CCP could just as well have used compromise—especially the termination of the movement and the dispersal of the public—as an opportunity to suppress grassroots forces that had already gained momentum and posed a threat to the regime, making it easier to defeat them one by one. The failure of “Occupy Central” can be seen as an example where peaceful assembly and dispersal did not yield optimal results. Although it had some impact, it clearly failed with regard to its two most important demands—“genuine universal suffrage” and “dual universal suffrage.”

If the 1989 democracy movement had “known when to stop,” it would certainly have achieved some results, but it might not have fundamentally altered one-party dictatorship. Limited freedoms and rights could have been reclaimed at any time by conservatives. If the people did not resist but instead endured passively, dictators who bully the weak and fear the strong might have become even more ruthless. As seen over the past three decades, despite widespread political apathy and minimal resistance among Chinese people, the stability maintenance apparatus grew increasingly strong in the later Hu–Wen period, and under Xi Jinping even the semblance of “peaceful, uneventful lives” has been denied to most ordinary people.

Thus, “the tree may wish to be still, but the wind does not stop.” When democratic forces are strongest, morale is highest, and mobilization and participation are widest, failing to seize the momentum and instead deflating oneself is also unlikely to produce good results. Had that path been taken, the CCP might have made some short-term concessions without abandoning authoritarianism, and later—due to changes in internal and external environments and political struggles—conservatives could have gained the upper hand, intensified authoritarianism, and divided and suppressed the democracy movement. The people, unable to regroup, would have been defeated piecemeal, and democracy would remain distant. In that case, today’s histories and commentaries might instead say that “the 1989 democracy movement failed to press forward and persist to the end, compromised and retreated, and thus missed a historic opportunity for China’s full democratization, laying the groundwork for later conservative forces to return to power and reimpose authoritarian oppression.”

During and after the anti–extradition bill movement, Xi Jinping steadily intensified authoritarianism and was unlikely to tolerate Hong Kong—a special administrative region under CCP control—acting independently and openly criticizing him and the CCP regime. Thus, even without intense resistance, Hong Kong people might have been gradually constrained through “boiling the frog slowly”–style repression, ultimately arriving at much the same outcome as today. It is hard to imagine that Xi Jinping and other power holders, amid extreme regression on the mainland, would tolerate Hong Kong holding annual political vigils commemorating June Fourth, or daily public political activities and media discourse openly opposing him and the CCP.

In sum, historical change is influenced by many variables. A change in one variable does not necessarily determine whether a particular outcome will or will not occur. Altering one variable can directly or indirectly alter others, and changing a single variable may well lead to outcomes just as bad, or even worse, than if it had remained unchanged. Compromise and moderation are necessary, but it is also wrong to attribute the failure of movements solely to protesters’ lack of compromise.)


The Pursuit of Radicalism and Perfection Can Be Maliciously Exploited and Invite Backlash: Taking Historical Reform Movements, the Distinction Between Corruption and “Political Donations,” the Different Evils of “Power” and “Capital,” Animal Protection, and the Evaluation of Political Figures as Examples

Excessive pursuit of radicalism and perfection can also be exploited by those who obstruct reform. Throughout history, when central governments have introduced policies intended to benefit the people, lower-level officials—fearing damage to their vested interests—have often attempted to resist them. They dare not openly oppose such policies, but instead push their implementation to extremes, causing good policies to produce harmful consequences and provoke strong resentment from all sides, thereby achieving their goal of blocking or overturning the policies.

Whether in various reform movements of ancient times (such as the reforms of Wang Anshi or the Hundred Days’ Reform) or in the numerous reforms and rectifications of today (healthcare reform, education reform, fiscal and tax reform), vested interest groups frequently and deliberately drive policy implementation toward extremes in order to force higher authorities to retreat or even abolish the policies. (Of course, some extreme measures are not driven by this motive—for example, Shandong’s “hundred days without births,” Beijing’s expulsion of the so-called “low-end population,” and the recent high-intensity COVID controls—these were not cases of lower levels intentionally pushing extremes to compel upper levels to halt policies, but rather of deliberately exerting force upward to curry favor with superiors, discipline the populace, and display official authority in order to gain benefits.)

Overemphasis on perfection also blurs differences in the degree of good and bad, and in the scale of gains and losses. It treats systems, policies, ideas, and events that are all imperfect but differ markedly in degree, as well as individuals or groups that all have flaws but where some are clearly “flawed warriors” and others merely “flies,” as uniformly “bad” or “evil,” asserting that “all crows are black.”

For example, it equates regulated and supervised “political donations” under democratic systems with corruption under authoritarian rule; it draws an equivalence between the relative economic tightness of ordinary people in developed countries and the struggle of Chinese citizens for basic food, clothing, housing, and transportation; and it compares limited speech restrictions in rule-of-law and free societies with the tight, comprehensive censorship of totalitarian systems.

Such positions may appear to reflect moral rigor and intolerance of evil (though some are deliberately malicious), but they inevitably lead to the situation described by the saying “when water is too pure, there are no fish; when people are too exacting, they have no companions.” They weaken enthusiasm and support for the relatively better side, allow those who are relatively worse, more evil, and more harmful to evade the proportionally greater condemnation and punishment they deserve, obstruct limited but valuable progress, and deprive further reform efforts of their foundation and stepping stones.

This is similar to how people in China often denounce the evils of capital and capitalists, while rarely mentioning the fact that capital is relatively gentler than power, and capitalists relatively less brutal than bureaucrats—thereby causing the more dangerous evil of power to be ignored or downplayed. Likewise, those who criticize the many problems of the reform and opening-up era often obscure the far darker and more desperate historical reality of the Mao era.

Opponents of animal protection often criticize animal welfare advocates for loving cats and dogs but not chickens, ducks, fish, pigs, or cattle (and if they claim to care about those, critics then ask why they do not also protect rats, flies, mosquitoes, or even bacteria and viruses). In this way, they deconstruct the value and necessity of protecting some animals, deliberately using rigid and partial logic (rather than a complete and systematic rationale) to negate the compromises that animal protectors make based on reality.

Beyond evaluating events, when judging historical figures, it is likewise inappropriate to criticize as equivalent those who all committed wrongs or crimes but whose degrees of culpability differ markedly. Figures such as Chiang Kai-shek, Deng Xiaoping, and Park Chung-hee, while authoritarian and responsible for the killing of innocents, also achieved certain economic and social accomplishments.

If they are lumped together with figures such as Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung—whose crimes were extreme—and all are labeled simply as cruel dictators, this may not be entirely indefensible, but it objectively downplays the evils of the latter group and erases the contributions of the former in certain domains. Such an approach, which fails to distinguish degrees of right and wrong, depth, and severity, is clearly unfavorable to an objective and comprehensive reflection of complex historical realities, and to accurate judgment and appropriate differentiation in dealing with historical figures.

Furthermore, under the effect of “extremes reversing,” when perfectionist goals fail, former adherents are likely to lose confidence entirely and become cynical or withdraw from society, unwilling even to participate in incremental reform, thereby pushing reality even farther from ideals. This is similar to how the failure of extreme communist policies led many people in those countries to develop a generalized aversion to all left-wing and progressive ideas.

The tragedies of the Cultural Revolution and June Fourth also lie in this post-failure conservatization. After the failures of the Cultural Revolution and the 1986 student movement and the 1989 democracy movement, Chinese intellectuals—and indeed large segments of the public—who had once been passionate about politics largely chose to withdraw, becoming refined egoists. The popularity since the 1990s of ideas such as “farewell to revolution” and “getting rich quietly” is precisely the product of failed radical demands and the collapse of corresponding political ideals. These outcomes are exactly what reform blockers and major wrongdoers hope to see and actively promote.

Extremism and the Pursuit of Perfection Often Come at the Expense of Others, Groups, Goals, or Values: Taking the Development of Heavy Industry in “Socialist States,” the “Dynamic Zero-COVID” Policy, WikiLeaks’ Disclosure of State Secrets, Radical Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Early Twentieth-Century China, and the Failures of the Two Ancient Emperors Wang Mang and Yang Guang as Examples

Extremism and thoroughness may appear “perfect,” but they are only “perfect” or victorious for certain specific goals or groups. For society as a whole and for broader, more diverse populations, they instead represent harm and failure—and they often rebound against the very goals they seek to achieve at all costs. This is because pursuing the perfection of one goal or insisting on the full realization of certain groups’ interests almost inevitably comes at the expense of other goals and by encroaching upon others’ interests.

For example, when countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea concentrated their resources on developing heavy industry, they consumed resources needed by other sectors, hindered the normal development of light industry and services, and turned peasants into “blood donors” and “sacrificial victims.” This led to distorted economic structures and an inability to meet citizens’ everyday needs for light industrial goods, agricultural products, and services, becoming an important cause of eventual economic collapse and systemic sclerosis.

Since the founding of the People’s Republic, various departments and localities have pursued “showcase projects” and enforced “one-size-fits-all” policies for the sake of political performance or to curry favor with leaders. While achieving certain objectives, these actions have inflicted even greater harm on people’s livelihoods. Similarly, in recent years China’s “dynamic zero-COVID” policy—centered on high-intensity lockdowns and quarantines—did indeed curb the spread of the virus, but it severely infringed on personal freedoms, damaged economic development, and caused tangible and intangible losses far exceeding the harm caused by COVID itself.

The actions of “extreme information libertarians” such as Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, and Julian Assange—publicly disclosing nearly all secrets they knew and advocating complete transparency of governments and politics—have undoubtedly helped expose the dark sides of U.S. and global politics and the infringement of citizens’ privacy through the combination of state power and big data. Yet extreme information libertarianism inevitably undermines counterterrorism and national security, damages international political operations and diplomatic relations, produces various negative effects, and in turn becomes a pretext for restricting information freedom.

In China after the Xinhai Revolution, the movements of “national salvation and enlightenment” surged. People broadly regarded resisting foreign invasion and colonialism externally, and pursuing democracy and prosperity internally, as firm and non-negotiable goals. In principle, this was of course correct. However, excessive nationalist tendencies—such as blind boycotts of foreign goods, harassment of foreigners in China (though many actions were self-defense), and the adoption of extremely exclusionary slogans—led to the deterioration of relations between China and the great powers, especially Japan.

Facing a neighboring and powerful Japan, Chinese citizens adopted radical anti-Japanese attitudes and pressured the Nationalist government to take a hard line. China’s radical nationalism, from a position of weakness, stimulated even more extreme Japanese nationalism and militarism, pushing the two nations into confrontation and making peaceful coexistence impossible, accelerating Japan’s invasion of China. As a result, China’s democratic development and economic and social progress were destroyed by the War of Resistance Against Japan and its aftermath.

Of course, the fundamental fault and crimes lay with Japan. Yet had there been room for compromise—had the Chinese people chosen to “bide their time and build strength” rather than loudly opposing imperialism and Japan, emphasized self-strengthening over excessive rigidity from a position of weakness—China might have avoided a series of subsequent disasters, history might have taken a different course, and Sino-Japanese relations would not have become as profoundly distorted as they are today. If one looks only at Sino-Japanese official and popular relations and interactions before the September 18 Incident and even the August 13 Incident, Japan actually rendered considerable assistance to China, especially to the Han Chinese, such as promoting the anti-Qing national democratic revolution and serving as an intermediary for the transmission of Western modern civilization.

After Japan’s invasion of China, especially the Nanjing Massacre, however, everything became irreparable. Even after diplomatic normalization, the relationship remained profoundly unhealthy and distorted. Japan’s support for the CCP’s dictatorship further destroyed any genuine friendship between China and Japan, a tragedy for both countries, and especially for China. The boycotts of Japanese goods and expulsions of Japanese nationals from 1919 to 1937 did not make China stronger or more prosperous; instead, they intensified Sino-Japanese antagonism.

By contrast, after reform and opening up, China’s comprehensive importation of Japanese goods and invitation for Japanese nationals to work and live in China effectively declared the failure and futility of the struggles a century earlier—losing both dignity and practical benefit. (Conversely, had China followed a path more like South Korea’s—focusing first on self-strengthening rather than boycotts, and only after strengthening itself pursuing autonomy and “rooted development”—it might have truly developed its national economy and safeguarded the interests of its people.)

History also offers many examples of feudal rulers driven by grandiose ambitions who spared no cost to pursue certain goals, such as Wang Mang, who forcibly implemented comprehensive political and social reforms, and Yang Guang, who was obsessed with massive construction projects and foreign campaigns. Some of their goals may have been well-intentioned and even had positive significance, but by disregarding real constraints and paying any political, economic, and livelihood cost, they provoked widespread rebellion and universal defection. By the time they abandoned their goals, it was already too late; their states collapsed and they themselves perished.

Their fates also demonstrate that excessive pursuit of narrow goals and self-interest, and an insistence on “perfection,” are often overly difficult and costly, especially as they provoke backlash from numerous groups whose interests are harmed. In the end, everything falls apart: not only are radical goals unattainable, but even preserving or restoring the former, imperfect state becomes impossible.

Power outages were not the goal of the action, but rather the fossil fuel industry. We apologize to the less affluent residents of southwest Berlin. However, our sympathy for the many villa owners in these neighborhoods is limited. We explain why in our article below.

The attack on the gas-fired power plant is an act of self-defense and international solidarity with all those who protect the earth and life. The infrastructures that serve the “technological attack” and promote the destruction of the earth can be sabotaged. Fossil fuel energy production can be stopped. Smart city metropolises, such as Berlin is supposed to become, can be prevented. With Stromnetz Berlin, a building block of this catastrophic vision of a smart city has been hit.

Our detailed explanation is attached to this information.

>NEW YEAR'S GREETINGS 2026. BE OF GOOD CHEER!

>Greed for power, greed for energy, greed for destruction
In the greed for energy, the earth is being depleted, sucked dry, burned, ravaged, burned down, raped, destroyed. Entire regions are being made uninhabitable by the heat. They are simply burning up. Or habitats are disappearing under the floods or due to rising sea levels. Several thousand residents of Tuvalu in the Pacific are already seeking refuge in Australia.

>Last year, the CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere rose to 423.9 parts per million, a value that surpasses all previous records. At the same time, climate researchers agree that the huge transatlantic ocean currents will eventually break down due to global warming. This collapse of the ocean currents, which has given the north a mild climate until now, is only part of the catastrophe that awaits us. The extent of this devastation is simply ignored, abstracted, and discussed at global climate conferences until the extent of the destruction has disappeared into tables and declarations of intent.
But the hunger for energy is insatiable and is eating its way through the Earth's crust and our lives, among other things, to feed artificial intelligence, which then spews out stereotypes and nonsense and confuses, disorients, and/or manipulates us. Meanwhile, language, expression, and liveliness are increasingly reduced, mutilated, and limited with each new “learning” of AI based on previous data.

>We feed our data into the “clouds,” which are nothing more than gigantic, energy-guzzling computing and server centers. They also drink our drinking water and excrete numbers that bombard us with useless, supposedly important spam on our screens until we have forgotten how to look our neighbors in the eye. Having become dependent on these small devices, we are always ready to send an emoji and feed “big brother,” whose algorithm registers our deviations from the norm and answers our search queries before we have even finished thinking. We sit together with our friends while the feeds consume us, and we sink into our devices instead of talking to each other in real life. We are serving our own surveillance, and it is total. The tech companies are in the hands of men of power, which we give them. We devour the colorful images that the machines filter for us and starve in front of our screens from loneliness and alienation. 

>We are becoming mindless zombies who run each other over in traffic. We are prisoners in a digital system that increasingly deprives us of our right to exist if we do not submit to the rules of the game and move our lives to social media, chat rooms, and artificial realities. We don't get any money, we can't book or buy anything in cash. Without access to the digital world, we are increasingly excluded, losing touch with what seems normal. We are afraid of what is happening to us and bury ourselves even deeper into our screens instead of turning off our devices and taking away the power of those who track, pursue, observe, and manipulate us. We blind ourselves to the knowledge that Edward Snowden risked his life to spread. We turn a deaf ear to the silent cries of indigenous peoples and farmers who see the planet's lifeline burning before their eyes. On the contrary, with every post we feed the fire that surrounds us and causes temperatures to rise to new record highs every year. One day, we will simply sit in front of glowing screens or dead devices and die of thirst and hunger. It is no longer difficult to imagine this.

>We're not saying we know the way out. But we know we have to stop this destruction. Hedonism can no longer ensnare us once we've smelled the cold sweat that spreads when there is no way out. No more forward and no more backward. Only the horror of where we as humanity have ended up. When the question comes back to us, what did you actually do to prevent what is coming? You saw it coming, the survivors, the next generations, will ask us. Please don't come to us with the parties. Please don't come to us with the brown alternatives in pinstripe suits and costumes. And not with the Greens or the Left either. Don't give us the economy, whose free market will solve the problem. Business and politics deal with death every day. With dictatorships and butchers. Concerns are virtually non-existent when it comes to satisfying the hunger for energy, for example. Russia is still supplying gas to Europe via Nord Stream 1. And the U.S. wants Venezuela's oil. That's why military attacks are now taking place. And fracking gas is being shipped in from all over the world. Currently, 79% of it comes from the US! Fracking is extremely harmful to the environment. Even during extraction, methane losses of 6 to 10 percent are assumed, which further heats up the atmosphere.

>95% of the gas burned in Germany is imported. Climate summits only produce tactical lip service because oil-producing countries are not interested in climate protection, but in money. Because metropolitan countries base their policies on money and growth, lobbyists in Europe are currently being given a free pass on the phase-out of combustion engines.

>German Minister of Economics Katharina Reiche, for example, was State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Transport, lobbyist for the Association of Municipal Companies (VKM), and manager at E.ON subsidiary Westenergie. E.ON Minister Reiche presents herself as a supporter of hydrogen, but is primarily focused on natural gas. She wants to issue tenders for additional gas-fired power plants with a capacity of 10 gigawatts, which are to be connected to the grid by 2031, corresponding to approximately 25 new power plants. 20 billion euros have been earmarked for these new gas-fired power plants.

>Reiche would prefer to postpone Germany's climate neutrality from 2045 to 2050 anyway.

>The main perpetrators of human-induced climate destruction are not those who suffer most from it, who pay for it with their health and their lives. The people of the Global South are already paying the highest price. The countries of the Global North, and soon China among others, are deciding the fate of everyone. China, as a communist, racist, and patriarchal dictatorship, can use “rare earths” to blackmail countries that do not toe the line, gradually weaving countries, cultures, and political systems into the cocoon of the new dictatorial world power. Over 85% of the world's refined “rare earths” come from China. And it is the rich who are the problem. It is the super-rich who are setting the world on fire. In the East, in the West, in the South and in the North. 60 percent of the investments made by the super-rich worldwide go into gas and oil. And around 300 super-rich individuals emit more CO² than the 110 poorest countries in the world. These criminals know this. They don't care. Their greed for even more wealth and power sets the standard that everyone follows. They are preparing their own “rescue” on isolated islands or in space once they have burned up this earth. A few years ago, we would have laughed at these misogynistic crackpots, but they are deadly serious. Zuckerberg wants more “masculine energy.” Musk “produces” children on an assembly line so that his clan will survive.

>None of the perpetrators are solving the “problem.” And the fundamental problem is certainly not being solved at the regional level. On the contrary, the whole world is arming itself for the final battle for raw materials, water, food, and access to strategically important regions in order to prevent or at least delay the demise of their own spheres of influence. So that the population can be offered the chance to participate for as long as possible. So that we in the global North, cocooned in a world of consumption and an imperial lifestyle, can participate and confirm the power of their increasingly authoritarian concepts. Because it is no longer about freedom for all, it is only about security for some. The promise of security is an exclusive right of those who can enforce it for themselves. We make the losers pay for our imperial lifestyle, those who are too weak to defend themselves against “us.”

>We reject the offers of participation in a burned-out world with our militant action. That is why we carried out the action at the gas-fired power plant in Lichterfelde.

>This does not prevent us from becoming entangled in an imperial way of life at the expense of other life, but it does send a signal. Once again, as many people and groups in different parts of the world are doing. As some groups here, such as volcano groups, have been doing consistently since 2011.

>We know that these words do not reach many people—they are so far removed from the idea of a world and a coexistence that is not based on destruction that these words reach them as little as the misery of the world that is transported daily in high resolution on our screens. We can list facts for miles and miles and still not be heard.

>We are not the first and we will not be the last to try to reach people with words anyway. We are not the first and last to resort to sabotage, because we are playing for time. At the same time, we and others are using the time we have gained to reverse the destruction of all life forms. People call us eco-terrorists, but we respect life. People call us irresponsible, but we are taking responsibility to end this imperial, destructive way of life.

>Our public welfare-oriented campaign is socially meaningful. We are trying to stop the exploitation of the earth, prevent CO₂ deaths, and halt the diseases associated with the climate catastrophe. We are also trying to put an end to species extinction and make the world a better place to live for everyone. Those who call us “eco-terrorists” are themselves the true eco-terrorists, expressing this in terms of selfish interests and power calculations.

>We see the unconscious who think they are smart and consider climate change to be fake news. They consider empathy to be woke and only have their own interests in mind, without recognizing how the things around them are interconnected. Behind this spreading rejection of facts, we see a system of those who invest in the destruction of the Earth. They are the same people who hold power over the tech companies, which allows them to breed a species of humans who applaud when people drown, die of thirst, starve, or otherwise perish in their attempt to reach Europe or the US. These manipulated prosperity chauvinists and party supporters second Trump, Modi, Miley, Netanyahu, Merz, Weidel, Putin, Höcke, Orban, Vans, Xi, and whatever else they are called, in their “defense” of freedom. The freedom to decide who must die and who must not. Who gets access to wealth and who does not. Yet every refugee who dies while fleeing has their counterpart here in a deep depression. Every person who starves makes us fatter and sicker.
We, the people of the global North, of the rich metropolises, derive no benefit from the misery of others. Material wealth is not wealth in the sense of an idea that can be enjoyed by everyone.

>If only a small portion of the population in every country would say, “Enough is enough. Not with us, not in my name. No one should die at our expense.” If we refuse to function and play along, if we become sand in the gears of a machine that we ourselves have been feeding, then something will start to happen, then we can develop the power to stop the causes once and for all.

>But we need an international movement to reject progress that is based solely on destruction, murder, and robbery. We call out desperately, angrily, and resolutely, joining the calls of others: Sabotage the fossil fuel infrastructure, the power grids, the exploitation of the earth, the server centers, the chip industry and its suppliers, destroy the foundations of the automotive and arms industries, of air travel, of mansions, yachts, spaceships, and golf courses. Destroy the police headquarters that guarantee patriarchal property relations, because the earth belongs to itself and to all living beings, not to humans, or rather to men alone, and not to the richest among them. This cry of despair is also a wake-up call, a cry of hope, and it has no local boundaries; it is global. We are talking about an international movement that does not refer to a patriarch, not to the gallery of heads that communists worship, but one that starts from different premises. One that is understood in China, in Europe, in the USA, in India and Pakistan, in every corner of the earth where Starlink has reception, in every country where the deadly drone seeks its target and needs electricity to do so. In every country where, without energy, the warring forces are blind and people can leave the battlefields without anyone being able to issue orders to kill them. Where the stock markets no longer function and bitcoins can no longer be accessed.

>We say it again, we have ideas but no definitive answers about the path. But we do have answers about the goal. Every contribution counts. But trying everything within our power to put an end to this imperial way of life cannot be wrong. The progress of destruction is man-made, and we can also stop it. In the steps of resistance, in the echoes of different languages and cultures, in what others send out to us, we will find and recognize ourselves. It's about the Earth. It's about life. It's against immature, stupid men at the levers of power who act as if they were operating a toy excavator.

>There is no time for frustration about resistance to man-made climate change and the growing number of deniers of this change. We must learn from our defeats, not by joining parties or privatizing or settling into collapse, but by establishing facts. Shutting down a gas-fired power plant is one such fact, but it can also be occupying land, squares, and forests, or destroying the golf courses and airports of the rich. Imagination and determination are required.

>Switch off the greed for energy, switch off the digital management of life, switch off the progress of destruction.

>Today we attacked the gas and steam turbine cogeneration plant in Lichterfelde. The power plant produces a total electrical output of 300 MW using natural gas. The target was the high-voltage power lines in order to cause significant damage to the company. We set fire to the cable bridge, which is not publicly listed and runs from the Lichterfelde power plant across the Teltow Canal, on the side of the green space. We also short-circuited the scorched cable strands with steel rods lying around.

>Das Energieunternehmen wird auf dem freien Markt Strom in Echtzeit kaufen müssen, um die Vertragsverpflichtungen zu erfüllen, die sie mit der Auslieferung des Stroms eingegangen sind, sobald der Ausfall der Lieferung bemerkt wird. Wir gehen nicht davon aus, dass wir dadurch 100.000 Haushalte vom Netz abgetrennt haben, sondern dass wir diese nur vom Netz des Gaskraftwerks abgetrennt haben. Das mehrfach gesicherte Energienetz wird über andere Wege der Energieleitungen die Haushalte in kürzester Zeit wieder über das weit verzweigte Stromnetz anschließen. Der kurzfristige Kauf von Energie zu den marktüblichen Preisen ist möglicherweise teurer als zu dem Zeitpunkt, als das Energieunternehmen den Strom an der Leipziger Strombörse (EEX) gekauft hat. Um nicht hohe Vertragsstrafen an die einzelnen Energieabnehmer zu zahlen bleibt ihnen kein anderer Weg. Wir haben über zwanzig 110 KV Leitungen kurzgeschlossen und die Fernwärmerohre nicht in den Anschlag einbezogen. Aber wir können Auswirkungen auf die Fernwärme nicht ausschließen.

>Our action differs in practical terms from the action in Adlershof on September 9, 2025, against the technology center. That involved a supply line that neglected redundant protection. The situation was similar with the “Vulkangruppe Tesla ausschalten” (Shut down Tesla volcano group), which took Tesla off the grid by destroying a supply line, affecting around 5,000 private households. In our case, the power will not be cut off in front of a facility such as the technology park or the Gigafactory, causing a blackout at that facility, but rather the power plant with its extensive network of cables will be disconnected from the power grid. It will still produce electricity, but will no longer be able to feed it into the grid and thus will no longer be able to supply it. However, the ability to supply private households via other power plants remains intact, which is also the intention of the authorities and energy giants. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that our action will have a greater impact on individual transformer stations.

>We have not interrupted the supply of district heating (thermal output around 690 MW).

> Individual households are not the target of this action. The aim of the action is to cause significant damage to the gas industry and the greed for energy.
If there are prolonged outages in private households, we want to make it clear that they are not the target of the attack. This effect was neither intended nor calculated by us. We have ruled out any danger to human life at all times.

>Since we cannot be 100% certain what chain reactions, beyond our control, our shutdown of the gasworks might cause, we have the following request for any households that may be affected: Ring your neighbors' doorbells. Please consider helping elderly or vulnerable people in the event of a power failure. Support yourself and others by offering solidarity and assistance. Keep each other informed.

>The combined heat and power plant in Lichterfelde was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swedish state-owned energy company Vattenfall AB, with annual sales of €7.6 billion and the fourth-largest electricity company after E.ON, RWE, and EnBW.

>In 2021, the power plant was “re-municipalized” and now belongs to the city of Berlin. As a result, the power plant is being partially dismantled and converted to accommodate additional capacity. This only sounds good at first glance.

>Stromnetz Berlin GmbH is currently making extensive investments in the expansion of Berlin's grid infrastructure in order to meet the growing demands of the so-called energy transition. To this end, Stromnetz Berlin's subsidiary BEN (Berliner Energie und Netzholding GmbH) is receiving €380 million from the European Investment Bank – “to prepare for the ongoing energy transition.” The “energy transition” is a smokescreen that obscures the fact that it is all about energy without transition and without ifs and buts. The main thing is energy, sustainable or not. Stromnetz Berlin wants to double its capacity by the beginning of 2030. The goal is a “modern” digitized power grid. In concrete terms, this means hundreds of thousands of meters of new power cables and grid components, as well as more digital services. We can guess that this is not being done out of charity. Ostensibly, it is about the city's security of supply, but on closer inspection, it is about a growth mania in a competition forced by the government. The battlefield is the city and our living conditions. The city is a commodity. Competitiveness with other major cities is intended to encourage more start-ups to settle there, more companies researching and producing armaments, more digital service providers and tech companies that consume even more electricity than the millions of Berliners use privately. It is also about e-mobility, which of course does not aim to promote public transport, but rather to put even more metal rolling through the streets powered by lithium batteries, and even more AI-dominated systems spewing out self-driving private vehicles. This is then classified as “infrastructure expansion,” which will cost the state another €3 billion by 2029, after the A100 motorway has eaten its way deeper and deeper into the city. Investments of up to €770 million will be made to renew the power grid.

>This all sounds rather tedious, but it is of great importance to us as residents of Berlin and Brandenburg, because it is our lives, our land, our water, and our future that are being negotiated here. For Giffey, the economic liberal of the SPD, the expansion of grid capacities and new power lines is a central prerequisite for Berlin as an investment location. These economic liberals, destroyers of a livable future, think of the city in terms of numbers, sums of money, growth rates, and competition with other cities. People don't count, or only as low-income or high-income variables. The former must be managed and restricted in some way—including through police and repressive measures, such as walling off a park in Kreuzberg. The latter are flattered, because their money stimulates consumption. For this group, the city is made smart and pretty. Berlin is a brand and is treated as such.

>For Giffay, the expansion of the power grid corresponds to the rapid digitization of everyday life, as if it were a force of nature descending upon us. As if it were not the tech corporations and tech fascists who are deciding on the implementation of AI, which, according to the Federal Ministry of Economics, will double global electricity consumption by 2030. It is not politicians and economic liberals who decide that cash payments will no longer be accepted on BVG buses, forcing people to use digital payments, which also ensures that they can be tracked, in a rebellious city with a tradition of militant movements that need to be controlled. When politicians decide to give the police and secret services access to Palantir surveillance software, whose driving force is a fascist from the US and whose software provides a digital network for monitoring people. Giffay promotes the expansion of the grid with “our” companies and the increasing electrification of mobility: “For the love of Berlin, the most modern power grid for the climate-neutral capital.” And, skilled at defusing criticism, Stromnetz Berlin has included “citizens' councils” as fig leaves, which can exercise ridiculous participation in trivialities but have no say in the direction of energy policy decisions and the design of the city. After Vattenfall and the city were forced by a broad citizens' initiative to initiate a “re-municipalization,” a nationalization of the power grid, and to appoint BEN as the owner, they are continuing business as usual and the madness continues unabated. The vision is clear: Smart City – Stromnetz Berlin says it all: “Berlin is on its way to becoming one of the leading smart city metropolises. This transformation process has already begun in all areas of urban life.” And: “Intelligent infrastructures, and especially the ‘smart grid’ (intelligent power grid), will form the foundation – as a networked operating system, it will become the backbone and catalyst of the energy transition.” Apart from the fact that we consider the term “energy transition” to be window dressing and would replace it with “technological attack on human conditions,” we agree.

>The specific attacks on the Adlershof Technology Park, Tesla's Gigafactory, the infrastructure of Vattenfall's Reuter coal-fired power plant, and Vodafone's hub in Adlershof are reference points for our action, as are the many militant actions that highlight the destruction of our planet. Even if these acts of sabotage cause high financial losses, they cannot force a change in political direction as individual (!) actions. But they point the way and direction that we recommend to all metropolises. Paralyze the infrastructures that serve the “technological attack” and promote the destruction of the earth. The consensus on participation in the project of an imperial way of life can be revoked. A mass social movement against the global destruction of the foundations of life and against all wars and resource plundering goes hand in hand with the ability to sabotage power grids and energy arteries.

>The attack on the gas power plant is an act of international solidarity with all those who protect the earth and life. Our resistance is diverse, and often, in the fog of disinformation, different cultural approaches, and linguistic differences, we still need too much time to recognize our commonalities. But we are confident that in the darkness, the light is not far away. When we place this action in the context of global resistance, whether in the US, Latin America, Asia, China, Russia, Europe, or Australia, against all manifestations of domination, rule, and destruction of the earth, we are confident that we will be heard, that these contributions will be translated, that translated contributions will reach us, that subversive communication will take place on the winding paths of resistance, recognizing each other. And intervening. And doing so without bloodshed, if possible, but determined to cut off the rulers' lifeline.

What are your controversial alternate history opinions?,1q597ys,9,6,2026-01-06 04:49:00,maproomzibz,WIAH,"Here's mine: 

\- if Byzantines survived into modern day, it would eventually become some kind of Eastern European dictatorship, or some kind of corrupt low trust society country like modern day Greece, not some glorious country. And Westerners would continue to bash it as a backward place. 

\- Korea would've been better off without Korean War and North conquering it all.

\- Al-Andalus, if it survived, would not go to America and colonize it, like the Spanish did.

\- Alexander the Great would not be able to conquer India if he survived, (India already had a competant ruler, Chandragupta, and their empire to Macedonia would be like Persia and Rome).

\- All AHs that include Rome magically expanding more and more, (and even worse colonizing America) are all boring and unrealistic (and then the same classical culture with same architecture surviving), and I would refer to watch a Roman alternate history going through cycles like China or other civilizations. And Rome become a larger Byzantium, and then also getting cultural influences from Germans, and then interacting with future Muslim or Slavic  countries like Poland, Russia and Caliphate.

\- Even as a pro-Palestine, all the scenarios of Jews being sent to Kenya, Madagascar, etc are all dumb.

(fun fact, Saudi Arabia is a strong US ally, who is also partially responsible for helping commit the Genocidal acts in Yemen)

I support the ethnic minorities and other people of Sudan who are being subject to unimaginable atrocities by the UAE funded RSF, as well as being betrayed by their own Sudanese army (fun fact, Israel is a strong ally of the UAE, and made over a billion dollars worth of arms deals with them right before the Sudanese Genocide restarted in 2023)

I support the people of the Eastern DR Congo who are being subject to unimaginable atrocities by the Rwandan funded M 23 (fun fact, Israel is a strong ally of Rwanda and made arms deals with them before the Congolese Genocide restarted in 2025, and they also armed the Hutu supremacist Rwandan government before the Tutsi Genocide of 1994, despite knowing that they hated Tutsis. Israel was also a strong ally of the Mobutu dictatorship, which was one of the most corrupt regimes in recent human history and stole much of the wealth of the Congo from its people in order to make a few friends of the dictator very rich)

I support the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities who are being persecuted by the CCP (fun fact, China is actually Israel's largest trading partner) 

I support the people of Tigray who were subject to unimaginable atrocities by the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies (fun fact, Israel was a strong ally of Ethiopia and made arms deals with their military before the war in which the Genocide took place)

I support the people of Haiti, who are being terrorized by gangs roaming the country (fun fact, Israeli and American weapons have been found with Haitian gangs by the UN)

I support the people of West Papua, who are being subject to unimaginable atrocities by the Indonesian military (fun fact, Israeli weapons have been found with the Indonesian military despite the West Papua Genocide being obscure, yet easy to access, public knowledge, and Israel made trade deals with the Suharto dictatorship of Indonesia who committed Genocides in Indonesia and what would become East Timor, despite knowing about the atrocities committed by the regime)

I support the people of Kurdistan and Assyria in their struggles for self determination, and who have been subject to unimaginable atrocities in recent history (fun fact, Israel is an ally of Turkey, which has committed Genocide against the Kurdish people on at least two separate occasions, in the 1920s-30s and 1980s-90s to be particular. The Turkish military has also committed acts of violence against Assyrians caught in the crossfire between them and Kurdish militants opposing the Turkish occupation. Israel made over a billion dollars worth of arms deals with Turkey in the 2000s, even though it continued to occupy Northern Kurdistan and parts of Assyrian lands.)

I support the Armenians of Artsakh who were subject to complete Ethnic Cleansing by the Azerbaijani military (fun fact, Israel is one of Azerbaijan's strongest allies, supplying 70% of their weapons in exchange for Azerbaijan supplying 40% of Israel's oil. Arms deals between the two continued despite the Anti Armenian racism in Azerbaijan that led to the Ethnic Cleansing of 2023)

I support the decolonization movements of Canada, the US, the Caribbean and Latin America (fun fact, Israel armed death squads in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, including the ones responsible for committing the Guatemalan Genocide. Israel also supported the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile and the Argentinian military junta, both of which killed thousands of people in what can only be considered Genocides)

For no particular reason, I would like to remind readers of Israel's strong support for the apartheid regime of South Africa, for the Genocidal French government in Algeria, for the Serb ethnofascists during the Bosnian Genocide and the Sri Lankan government during the Tamil Genocide. 

And I support the Christians and other people of Northern Nigeria who are being subject to unimaginable atrocities by Muslim extremists, as well as the religious minorities in all South Asian countries like Pakistan, India and Bangladesh who are often targets of violence and discrimination, as well, and other people groups suffering because of their ethnicity, religion, nationality and other things they should not be punished for. I will stand with them, regardless of whether Israel contributes to their suffering or not. 

Dear zionists, it seems like your beloved ""oasis of human rights"" has helped persecute many of the people you want me to support. Speaking of which, I rarely see you support them, and when you do, you often  ignore all responsibility that Israel bears for injustice against them. It's almost like you don't actually care about them and only want to use a weak whataboutism argument to both distract from what is happening in Palestine and to personally attack the people speaking out against it. 

Even if Israel never supported the regimes I just talked about, it would not justify, among other things:

The eviction of thousands of Palestinian fellaheen before 1948

The Ethnic Cleansing of the Nakba between 1947 and 49
The continued Ethnic Cleansing of Palestinians (especially the Naqab Bedouin) between 1949 and 1967

The occupation of the rest of Palestine in 1967 which caused another wave of Ethnic Cleansing called the Naksa

The continued Ethnic Cleansing from then until today

The building of illegal settlements both within and outside the Green Line

The terribly inadequate response to settler terrorism against Palestinians

The apartheid against Palestinians through legally protected discrimination in land sales, housing, funding of government institutions and other parts of life

The blockade of Gaza after 2006 and the collective punishment of the population of Gaza that the UN predicted would make the place unliveable by 2020

The Genocide of Gaza from 2023 to 2025 where at least 80,000 identified dead were killed by direct Israeli actions (not to mention the ones who have not yet been found) and where most of Gaza faced some of the worst destruction in modern history. 

The systematic rape and torture in absolutely vile ways, of Palestinians all across Palestine from 1948 until today, causing unimaginable trauma for survivors 

The appropriation of Palestinian heritage, whether that be food, archeological sites, clothing or anything else that is claimed as Israeli when in reality it is not

The very denial of the existence of Palestinians as a distinct people group (let alone an indigenous one) despite numerous records showing South Levantine Arabs identifying as Palestinians well before the zionist movement (and every genetic study including Palestinians confirming that they are Arabized descendants of Bronze Age Levantine groups like Canaanites)

The dehumanization of Palestinians sickeningly prevalent across Israeli society that robs them of the very opportunity to be taken seriously as equal human beings, let alone progress in their lives 

Nothing justifies the decades of cruelty that the State of Israel and Zionism have enacted upon the people of Palestine, and nothing will stop Palestinians from one day being free in the land of their ancestors ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1q3rciq/dear_zionists_i_condemn_atrocities_happening_in/
USA is right in invading Venezuela,1q2w81p,4,22,2026-01-03 14:41:33,discipline4succes,KeralaDesham,"I saw a post here demonizing the USA and making Venezuela and maduro look good, this post is a rely to that 

1. The main reason 

• China is encircling Taiwan

• In 2027, China will commemorate the 100th anniversary (Centenary) of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)

• Xi Jinping has said his generals to have Taiwan as part of China by 2027.

• 40% of Chinas heavy crude oil imports is from....

U guessed it.... Venezuela....

• Think of how huge China and its population military

• If USA hold venezuelas heavy crude oil supply and stops supply to them, it’s gonna cost China a lot more and harder for them if war starts

2 Secondary reason 

• Venezuela is not a democracy, it’s an authoritarian state

• Means a dictator and his military and intelligence organization is running the country, not the people 

• USA is coming to bring democracy to Venezuela is giving humans in Venezuela political rights 

3 Minor reason 

USA imperialism is way better Chinese imperialism

USA imperialism ideology is democracy, Chinese imperialism ideology is  dictatorship and no form of criticism 

4 Another minor reason 

This is not a republican or a democrat issue. This is an American issue, a global issue for democracy. Hurting Chinese heavy crude oil imports or at least making it more expensive and also meantime bringing democracy to Venezuela is worth a war with Venezuela 

5 India’s Relation

• A weak China is better for India, 

• China has territorial claims on eastern India, 

• China is already occupying a part of Kashmir, 

• During the pahalgam attacks and Indias retaliation on Pakistan. China was fully on pakistans side

• While America was at least bit more neutral maybe even pro India. But definitely more pro India and anti Pakistan than China 

6 Minorities

• Literally all relegious people, Hindus, Muslims, christians. They’re all safer and in a better place in a us global hegemony world than Chinese global hegemony world

The Background, Characteristics, and Influence of The Taebaek Mountains

    The film The Taebaek Mountains is adapted from the long novel of the same name by the Korean writer Jo Jung-rae. It tells and depicts a series of historical events that occurred in Beolgyo-eup, Boseong County, South Jeolla Province, during the period from Japan’s surrender to the outbreak of the Korean War. (In Korea, an “eup” is roughly equivalent to a “township” in China.) The Taebaek Mountains presents not only the customs and stories characteristic of South Jeolla Province and the Beolgyo region, but also reflects the historical realities widely seen across the entire “three-thousand-li land” of the Korean Peninsula during those years. After the original work was adapted into a film, the complex narrative was condensed, yet the film still preserved the basic structure of the story, restored the essence conveyed by the novel, and, by making use of the advantages of visual media, rendered the story more vivid, expressive, and emotionally compelling.

    Moreover, the superb direction of Im Kwon-taek—known as the “Godfather of Korean Cinema”—and the outstanding performances of actors such as Ahn Sung-ki, the “national leading actor,” further enhanced the excellence of the film. Upon its release in 1994, the film won more than ten awards, including Best Film at the Blue Dragon Awards, the highest honor in Korean cinema, marking a milestone in Korean film history. 

The publication of the complete version of the novel, as well as the production and release of the film, all took place several years after Korea’s democratization in 1987. For this reason, the film also reflects the social sentiments of the time—when the right-wing military dictatorship had ended, pluralistic democratic politics was beginning to take shape, and Korean society, especially the intellectual community, was reexamining history, calling for humanitarianism, and experiencing the rise of center-left ideologies.

    Yet what the film reflects goes far beyond these aspects; it carries even richer and more complex meanings and values. To explore these, one must examine and analyze the detailed content of the novel and the film one by one.


The Repeated “Changes of Flags” in Beolgyo-eup, South Jeolla Province: Beginning with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident

    At the beginning of the film, subtitles explain the historical background of The Taebaek Mountains: the U.S.–Soviet Cold War and ideological confrontation led to the division and conflict of the Korean Peninsula. The melancholy opening theme and the scene of a flock of geese circling above the Taebaek Mountains foreshadow the tragic nature of this story.

    The film opens with the ringing of telephones in the police station and the youth corps breaking the nighttime quiet of Beolgyo. Yeom Sang-gu, the inspector general of the youth corps who is playing cards, and Nam In-tae, the police chief on duty at the station, hear news of a revolt in Yeosu and the fall of Suncheon. They immediately flee Beolgyo with their men. Meanwhile, Yeom Sang-gu’s elder brother, Yeom Sang-jin—who had joined the South Korean Workers’ Party (the South Korean branch of the Workers’ Party of Korea, conducting underground activities in areas controlled by the Rhee Syngman regime)—leads a guerrilla unit under the command of the South Jeolla Provincial Party Committee, raising the North Korean flag and occupying Beolgyo without a fight.

    The real historical background of this story is the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident of October 1948. Anyone with some knowledge of modern Korean Peninsula history will be familiar with this event. It was the largest military rebellion to occur after the establishment of the Rhee Syngman regime, which governed the southern side of the 38th parallel, and it had major implications for the peninsula’s situation. Before the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident, the Rhee regime’s rule was relatively stable, and Kim Il-sung had not yet decided to invade the South. But after the incident, Kim Il-sung perceived conflict within Rhee’s government and widespread social unrest, and consequently decided to march south to unify the peninsula.

    Indeed, the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident was a concentrated reflection of the unstable military morale, fragmented public sentiment, and social turbulence in the southern half of the peninsula (for convenience, hereafter abbreviated as “South Korea,” even though some events occurred before the formal founding of the Republic of Korea). The immediate trigger for the incident was the refusal of certain Korean troops stationed in Yeosu to suppress the civilian uprising in Jeju. And the cause of the Jeju uprising itself was the military and police suppression of demonstrators. Both the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion and the Jeju uprising were supported and encouraged by the South Korean Workers’ Party.

    The fundamental reason the South Korean Workers’ Party was able to successfully incite revolt was the severe social contradictions in South Korea and the authoritarian and arbitrary rule of the Rhee Syngman regime (these two points will be discussed in later sections). 

Meanwhile, the left-wing forces advocating the establishment of a “communist paradise,” along with the seemingly energetic northern half of the peninsula, held considerable appeal for soldiers and civilians in the South—who were bewildered by chaos and suffered from injustice and exploitation under Rhee. As a result, a series of military and civilian uprisings erupted, with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident being the largest military revolt among them.

    Returning to the film to trace clues: after Yeom Sang-jin’s guerrillas occupy Beolgyo, they enthusiastically contact other rebel forces while immediately launching a purge, subjecting local landlords, bureaucrats, military and police officers, and other anti-communist and pro-government figures to denunciations and executions. Except for Kim Sa-yong, the father of the protagonist Kim Beom-u (played by Ahn Sung-ki), who is spared because he once taught Yeom Sang-jin and helped support his schooling, all other landlords and pro-government anti-communist individuals who failed to flee are killed—over 100 people in total. For a single “eup,” this amounted to a brutal massacre.

    But within less than three days, government forces defeated the rebels holding Suncheon, and the Beolgyo guerrillas were forced to flee hastily—killing civilians perceived as hostile to the left before their retreat. When government troops, police, and militias returned to Beolgyo, they quickly launched retaliatory operations, slaughtering relatives of guerrillas and informants who had cooperated with them. Later, during a series of government military and police purges, many individuals accused of having had secret contact with guerrillas were also killed. At night, the left-wing guerrillas struck back in turn, raiding towns, executing informants, forcibly conscripting young men, and seizing cattle and grain.

    Such cruel cycles of mutual slaughter and retaliation were occurring throughout the peninsula from 1945 to the 1950s. On the surface, these killings stemmed from conflict between two regimes (the Kim Il-sung regime and the Rhee Syngman regime) and two ideologies (communism and feudal capitalism). But the more immediate cause lay in unequal distribution of wealth—especially land—which drove survival-based violence and created vicious cycles of hatred and retaliation.

The Land Issue: The Focal Point of Political Struggles and Ideological Confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, and the Root of Life-and-Death Struggles Among the People

  The land issue on the Korean Peninsula can be traced back to the feudal period of Joseon (here the term “feudal” follows Marxist historiography and related translations, same below). The feudal dynasty of Joseon, similar to China’s ancient dynasties, was also built upon the rule of the landlord class, and the dynasty primarily represented the interests of that class. However, compared with China, the feudal dynasty and entire traditional society of Joseon had an even more rigid structure. 

Joseon’s traditional culture, which inherited and modified Confucian culture from China, became more conservative and more strictly bound by ethical norms and hierarchical propriety. As a result, social classes became even more sharply divided. In ancient Joseon, the “yangban,” composed of aristocrats, officials, scholars, and military officers, were the privileged class of the nation and the ethnicity. They enjoyed far higher status and wealth than commoners, maintained hereditary succession, intermarried among themselves, and formed tightly knit cliques. The most important resource that demonstrated and secured their wealth and status was land.

    The yangban aristocracy controlled most of the land on the Korean Peninsula, but naturally did not cultivate it themselves. They hired tenant farmers to work the land, and these tenants gradually became servants attached to them. Although the peninsula’s tenant farmers were not officially labeled “serfs” like Russian peasants, the degree of oppression they suffered—especially their loss of personal freedom—was in some respects even worse than Russia’s “serfs,” and harsher than what Chinese peasants experienced. This was related to Joseon’s relatively stricter institutional and cultural system, as well as the peninsula’s limited land, dense population, low per-capita farmland, heavy farming pressure, and the lack of any real room for peasants to migrate.

    The yangban aristocrats lived lives of comfort or even indulgence, while peasants survived by cutting expenses and living on the brink of hardship. Whether peasants could live slightly better, or even simply have enough to eat, often depended on the personality or momentary mood of their yangban masters. Therefore, the conflict of interest between the aristocracy and the peasants was extremely severe, and society was highly stratified. Yet due to Joseon’s deep mastery of Confucian traditions and institutional structures adopted from China, the ruling class of Joseon succeeded in maintaining long-term stability. Even in rare instances of dynastic change (far fewer than in China), these were merely changes of power among the elite, with very few peasant revolts.

    Furthermore, although the yangban were extravagant, they also served as the backbone of the Joseon dynasty (and other local regimes on the peninsula), bearing responsibilities such as governing the state, maintaining order, developing the economy, promoting education and culture, undertaking construction projects, and defending against foreign invaders. They were the central force that enabled Goryeo/Joseon civilization to survive and flourish for centuries. It was precisely because they were supported by the peasants that they could escape the hardships of subsistence agriculture, avoid being burdened by farming labor, and instead concentrate on fulfilling their responsibilities.

    Most importantly, the Korean Peninsula is small in area and historically suffered repeated invasions—from Japan in the east, from Chinese dynasties in the west, and from nomadic or hunter-gatherer tribes in the north. Thus, internal unity was necessary to resist external aggression, which to some extent alleviated internal contradictions. In resisting foreign invasions, the yangban played a central role, and peasants could only unite and form military strength under yangban leadership. Under the monarch’s command, the two classes cooperated and enabled the relatively weak Joseon to withstand external threats and preserve statehood and civilization.

    However, this did not mean class contradictions did not exist. On the contrary, long-term oppression resulted in increasing class rigidity and intensifying class antagonism, with resentment accumulating over time. With the opening of the country in the 19th century and the influence of modern civilization, as well as the various impacts of Japanese colonial rule (which created a crisis of national survival while also weakening the rule of the Joseon aristocracy), the yangban system, along with the entire traditional social structure, faced fierce challenges. The Donghak Peasant Revolution, which occurred shortly before the First Sino-Japanese War, was a violent uprising of the Korean peasantry against internal and external oppression.

    After the peninsula became a full colony of Japan in the early 20th century, neither the Japanese colonizers nor Korean right-wing anti-Japanese nationalists and modernizers such as Syngman Rhee advocated thoroughly destroying the old system or the yangban aristocracy, nor did they intend to change land distribution or the broader relations of production. Instead, they actively sought to win over and utilize the old elite.

    For example, while Japanese colonial authorities killed, exiled, or expelled anti-Japanese yangban, they also supported and employed pro-Japanese yangban, transferring the land of the former to the latter. Korean peasants thus suffered dual oppression—from Japanese colonizers and from pro-Japanese yangban aristocrats. And right-wing nationalists represented by Syngman Rhee placed national liberation from Japan above all else, but had no intention of liberating the peasants. Instead, they likewise sought to win over yangban and other landlords and capitalists (after coming to power, the Rhee regime even harmed peasant interests to please the landlord class, which will be discussed later).

    The only forces that firmly advocated completely abolishing yangban privileges, dismantling the traditional social structure, granting peasants and other oppressed groups full citizenship, and equal distribution of wealth were the emerging groups of Korean socialists/communists. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, socialists in Korea were extremely marginalized and merely one branch within the broader nationalist movement. Moreover, due to the peninsula’s small population and limited social and cultural infrastructure, most Korean socialists operated in China, Japan, or Russia, with many holding foreign citizenship rather than Korean citizenship.

    After the victory of the Russian October Revolution and the establishment and rise of the Chinese Communist Party, many Korean socialists in Russia and China joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the CCP. Compared with right-wing nationalists like Syngman Rhee—who were also active abroad but maintained closer ties with anti-colonial movements inside the peninsula (Rhee and others were active mainly in the United States, Western Europe, and Kuomintang-controlled China)—the left-wing socialists remained relatively marginal both abroad and within Korea. For example, the March First Movement—marking the beginning of modern independence struggles on the peninsula—though influenced by the ideology of national self-determination and liberation, was led by traditional landlord elites (yangban) and emergent bourgeois figures (the peasants who joined were merely followers under their landlords’ orders). Its goals were national independence, not socialism or communism.

    Even so, some anti-imperialist and anti-colonial socialists remained active on the peninsula, the most prominent being Pak Hon-yong, who later became the actual leader of the South Korean Workers’ Party. Among the core figures of the later North Korean regime, Pak Hon-yong was the only one who had been long active on the peninsula during the colonial period (others such as Kim Il-sung, Kim Chwae-hyŏk, and Heo Ga-i were mainly active abroad in China or the Soviet Union). The “provincial party,” “county party,” and guerrilla forces mentioned in the film all belonged to the South Korean Workers’ Party established by Pak Hon-yong. It was through the persistent struggle of Pak Hon-yong and others on the peninsula—including enduring imprisonment and torture—that socialist ideology and related movements took root among grassroots populations, forming the foundation for both the establishment of the North Korean regime and the left-wing resistance under the South Korean Rhee government.

    The main promise made by Pak Hon-yong and other socialist/communist activists to mobilize peasants for revolution was the redistribution of land—confiscating all land from the landlord class without compensation and dividing it among peasants, realizing “land to the tiller” and equal prosperity. Of course, they also preached communist ideology to peasants, denouncing the evils of feudal Confucian norms and the injustice of hierarchical systems, and claiming they would establish an earthly paradise of equality. 

Although these ideas contradicted the education instilled in peninsula residents for thousands of years, they nevertheless resonated with many long-oppressed peasants, especially poor tenant farmers. Meanwhile, some intellectuals from relatively affluent or even aristocratic backgrounds were drawn to left-wing ideals out of pure idealism and joined the revolutionary cause at the risk of their lives.

    The left-wing guerrilla forces in the film are precisely those directed and commanded by the South Korean Workers’ Party. In their internal review after retreating from Beolgyo, when Ahn Chang-min, an intellectual, criticized the party’s mistakes, Yeom Sang-jin fiercely demanded that he stop criticizing the party, because “the Party is always sacred and wise; all criticism of the Party is wrong.” This clearly reveals the Party’s strict control over revolutionaries and the severity of party discipline. It also shows that the communist forces in Korea at that time had already developed strong tendencies toward dogmatism and extremism.

    The background composition of the guerrilla core members reflected the typical makeup of participants in the left-wing movement on the peninsula. Yeom Sang-jin was born into a poor farming family, entered the teachers’ college through his diligence, came into contact with left-wing thought, and—combined with his personal and family suffering—became awakened and turned into a revolutionary. 

Ahn Chang-min represented upper-class intellectuals who leaned left; he devoted himself to the left-wing revolution purely for ideals, not personal gain, even betraying his own class background for those ideals. Another figure, Jeong Ha-seop (the guerrilla messenger who gradually develops feelings for the shaman Sohwa), came from a landlord family and, driven by idealism, also became a “progressive youth” who rebelled against his class. But he was younger than Ahn Chang-min and even more passionate and pure in his revolutionary zeal.

    Most other guerrillas were from poor peasant backgrounds. Many joined simply to obtain land or because they could no longer endure landlords’ oppression. For example, the tenant farmers who killed a landlord surnamed So—who had tried to sell land to avoid redistribution—and then defected to the guerrillas, were typical. Many others were forcibly conscripted or semi-forcibly coerced into joining, entering the “revolution” in a confused state.

    Professional revolutionaries as leaders, intellectuals as the backbone, and peasants as the main body—this was the basic composition of the left-wing forces on the Korean Peninsula (the same was true in other agricultural countries such as China and India). Intellectuals joined for the ideal of universal equality, peasants joined to gain their own land, and all aspired to a distant yet beautiful “communist paradise.”

    The rise of left-wing forces advocating land revolution naturally provoked fear among the traditional landlord class. Whether pro-Japanese yangban or nationalist landlords, capitalists, and intellectuals, all intensely hated communist forces. The Japanese colonial authorities violently suppressed left-wing movements—Pak Hon-yong was repeatedly arrested and tortured, once nearly driven insane, and later released and escaped to China only through extensive rescue efforts. Right-wing nationalists led by Syngman Rhee likewise refused to cooperate with the left (and certainly not with communists like Pak Hon-yong or Kim Il-sung), viewing one another as enemies.

    The confrontation and conflict between the left and right, between aristocrats and commoners, and between landlords and tenant farmers continued from the colonial era into the post-liberation period, and became even more violent due to the division of the peninsula—resulting in massive massacres and warfare.

Religion and Political Theory,1qbs2eg,0,1,2026-01-13 14:01:00,nerdose,philosophy,"when a belief system becomes law, it ceases to function as belief in any meaningful philosophical sense. in iran, a fundamentalist interpretation of islam was transformed into state power, and conscience was replaced by coercion. faith was no longer voluntary but enforced through punishment, surveillance, and violence. what was demanded was not conviction, but submission.
this collapse of belief into obedience destroys moral agency. a person cannot be said to freely believe when refusal carries the threat of imprisonment or death. religion, once fused with absolute power, becomes an instrument of domination rather than a system of meaning.
for many of us who escaped this system, the problem does not end in exile. in western societies that claim to value free inquiry, speaking critically about religious authoritarianism is often treated as moral transgression. lived experience of oppression is dismissed, while the ideology that enabled it is protected from critique.
the result is a quiet moral failure. those harmed by enforced belief are asked to restrain their speech in the name of tolerance. but tolerance that requires silence from the oppressed is not a virtue. it is complicity.",https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-politics/
Stand with Iran not Islamophobia,1qbrqkk,1,0,2026-01-13 13:47:31,psymonone,complaints,"I am so sick of right-wing media using what’s happening in Iran as an excuse to launder Islamophobia.

“See? Even people over there hate Islam.”

No. Shut up. That’s not what’s happening and you know it.

People in Iran aren’t risking their lives because they woke up one day and decided they hate a religion. They’re fighting an authoritarian theocracy that controls their bodies, their speech, their futures, and their dissent through state violence wrapped in religious justification.

They don’t hate faith. They hate being ruled by it.

Americans love to forget this, but separation of church and state is not universal. It’s foundational here. In Iran, religion is the government. You don’t get freedom of belief, you get obedience. You don’t get pluralism, you get clerics deciding how you live or whether you’re allowed to live at all.

Watching pundits twist a revolt against oppression into “proof” that Muslims hate Islam is disgusting. It’s lazy, dishonest, and dangerous. It takes people fighting tyranny and turns them into props for bigotry.

You can be religious and still oppose theocracy. In fact, many of the people protesting are. Wanting freedom from religious rule is not Islamophobia. It’s the same impulse that led to the First Amendment.

Stop flattening real human suffering into culture-war ammo. People are being beaten, imprisoned, and killed, and you’re using it to score racist talking points.

The Fakir who would not beg,1qbr3z0,3,0,2026-01-13 13:20:06,Electrical_Trust3873,PurbaIndia,"[Fakir Mohan Senapati](https://preview.redd.it/0y94drona4dg1.jpg?width=993&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74e5e7ce6145cd6efd9d5276bdc58237a80c12a7)

There is something theatrical about the way poverty tries to destroy certain men. It throws everything at them—dead parents, spousal deaths, illness, hunger, humiliation—and then sits back to watch the show. In the case of Braja Mohan Senapati, poverty made an error. It assumed the boy would break.

The boy who would become Fakir Mohan Senapati, the father of modern Odia literature, began life as an unwanted burden. Father Lakshmana Charan passed away when he was barely one and half years old. His mother died soon after. The only person standing between him and oblivion was his grandmother, Kuchila Dei. Fakir Mohan was so sickly that his grandmother, in a final gamble with fate, took him to a Muslim Pir.

In desparation, she made a deal with God: if he survived, she would rename him Fakir Mohan—after a Muslim mendicant—and he would beg at religious gatherings. The child lived and Brajamohan became Fakir Mohan. But he would spend his life refusing to beg.

Illness clung to Fakir Mohan like a second skin. So persistent was his sickliness that he couldn’t begin learning the alphabet until he was nine—an age when other children were already racing ahead. Even then, education came with a price that had nothing to do with money. At the old-type primary school, young Fakirmohan paid for his lessons by staying behind to cook for the teacher, wash utensils, perform odd jobs—a child labourer masquerading as a student.

But even this meager education was too much for his jealous uncle Purushottam to bear. While his uncle’s own children were sent to prestigious missionary schools—the kind that promised futures—Fakir Mohan’s learning came to a grinding halt. At 10, he was deployed as a wage-earner at the quayside of Balasore, his formal education amounting to less than what a modern child completes in a few months.

Here is where the story should have ended—another talented boy crushed under the wheel of circumstance, forgotten before he could begin. But the apparently insignificant, ill-clad child-laborer possessed something poverty couldn’t confiscate: an appetite for knowledge that bordered on the pathological.

When his uncle apprenticed him to a notary public in the Salt Department, Fakir Mohan somehow found time to pick up Bengali, Persian, and Sanskrit from different teachers. This wasn’t education; this was theft—stealing moments of learning from the margins of exhaustion. Later, when he was past the age of 50, he would casually arrange for a pundit to teach him Telugu during a stay in Tekkali.

His relationship with English was particularly absurd: he knew nothing of the language until 23, by which time he was already Head Pundit of the Mission School at Balasore. Then, stung by the mockery of a European officer’s orderly, he simply decided to learn the “royal language” and did.

At 15, when the Salt Department was abolished, Fakir Mohan found himself among the unemployed locals wandering the office premises like ghosts haunting their former lives. But this purposeless loafing germinated something. The neglected orphan made a decision entirely his own: he would get proper education.

Without informing even his grandmother, he enrolled at the Mission School at Barabati. He attended classes semi-naked—no upper garment—while his cousin Nityananda was covered in expensive satins. The contrast was designed to humiliate, but Fakir Mohan felt only joy while his teachers marveled at his brilliance, his sincerity, his humility.

But he couldn’t afford the school fee of four annas—25 paise—per month. The arrears accumulated like unpayable debts. His uncle, yielding reluctantly to combined appeals in the first year, flatly refused help in the second. After six months of struggle, Fakir Mohan gave up in disgust and despair.

The irony is almost too perfect: the man who would usher Odisha into the modern age couldn’t finish primary school because he lacked four annas a month. Yet within months, the headmaster of his former school invited him back—not as a student but as a teacher, at a salary of two Rupees and fifty paise. His grandmother, who had loved him through everything, ran about in supreme happiness at this first great achievement. The salary was later raised to four rupees, considerable income at a time when a paisa had more purchasing power than a modern Rupee.

Fakir Mohan proved himself to be a resourceful teacher. Unable to find geography maps, he made his own. Asked to teach mathematics in his third year, he mastered arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry by himself—there was nobody in Balasore who could help him with the advanced subjects. The erstwhile child labourer transformed, as though by miracle, into an extraordinarily brilliant teacher of mathematics, literature, and history.

His reputation grew until the European Mission authorities installed him as headmaster of the only respectable educational institution in Balasore, at monthly salary of Rs 10. Under his guidance, the school dominated state scholarships year after year. More remarkably, this man with rudeimentary primary education won government rewards for his Odia textbooks on mathematics, geography, trigonometry, and Indian history.

But Fakir Mohan’s real battle was cultural. Bengalis mocked the Odias for lacking suitable textbooks. To wipe out this insult, the humble schoolmaster turned to Odia language and literature itself. He set up a printing press and became the face of linguistic resistance, publishing newspapers, even as jibes like “bloody ring leader” were thrown at him by his opponents. He published journals, wrote poems, epics, essays, stories, and novels with nonchalant brilliance, never bothering about rhetorical finesse, creating works that carried the genuine, racy speech of common people but made tremendously meaningful by intuitive genius.

If professional humiliation wasn’t enough, his domestic life had its own tumults. His first marriage at the age of 13 was to Lilavati Devi, a woman who, alongside his heartless aunt, made his existence unbearable—harsh, arrogant, delighting in doing the opposite of what he wanted. When she died after a year-long illness, he married again, this time to 12-year-old Krushna Kumari, who filled his life with love for next 25 years. When she died after 25 years of marital life, she plunged him into unrelieved sorrow for another quarter century until his death.

When he retired to Cuttack in 1896, at the age of 53, something miraculous happened. The man who had spent his childhood begging for education, began to give Odia literature everything it needed to become modern from his Cuttack home. His novel *Chha Maana Atha Guntha* dissected feudalistic Odia society with surgical precision. His short story *Rebati* was the first modern Odia short story—a feminist cry from 1898 that still echoes. In *Mamu*, he dissected the moral rot of 1860s Odisha when British overlords, in a rare moment of administrative guilt, had opened lower-rung government jobs to educated Odias. The novel chronicles this particular species of urban parasite—the government clerk who rebuilt their ancestral glory one embezzled rupee at a time. In *Lachhama,* he documented the mid-18th century era when the Mughal empire had declined considerably leaving vacuum into which galloped the Maratha bargees—mercenaries who'd perfected the art of sudden violence. Odisha became the playground of Maratha bargees, who weren't soldiers but enthusiastic vandals on horseback, preferring arson and loot to actual combat.

He died in 1918, having spent his final years producing stories and novels with the energy of a young genius in his prime—an astoundingly productive old age despite domestic torment and prolonged sickness. A year before death, at the ripe age of 75, he enrolled as a student at Satyavadi Vana Vidyalaya, playing with boys, joining recitation competitions, washing his own eating plates.

The grandmother’s bargain with God had been fulfilled in an unexpected way. Despite poverty throwing everything at him, Fakir Mohan never begged. Instead, he made an entire language beg him to save it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PurbaIndia/comments/1qbr3z0/the_fakir_who_would_not_beg/
