**Reflections for India and Bangladesh**

Watching this IAS officer analysis, it is impossible not to see the parallels in our own backyard. What happened in Pakistan over 40 years is currently accelerating in **Bangladesh as well as India.**

In Bangladesh, we are witnessing how quickly the Rule of Law dissolves when radicalization becomes a political tool. Once the extremism is lit, the economic progress of decades can be incinerated in a few short years as investors flee the instability.

However, we must also look at **India** with the same brutal honesty. Across the political spectrum, we see each and every party is indulging in ideological and religious brainwashing to secure their own power. Whether it is Hindus, Muslims, or Christians, every community is being fed a narrative of ""***us versus them***."" Media is adding fuel to this nonstop, so is judiciary giving clean chit to criminals, antisocial elements, rapists etc.

We are forgetting that radicalization is often the byproduct of **deprivation**. When we fail to provide jobs, healthcare, and education, we leave our youth vulnerable to the highest bidder of hate. If we continue to let political  and religious ideologies replace Constitutional Morality, we aren't ""protecting"" any religions too this way, we are simply sowing the same seeds that destroyed our neighbors.

True nationalism isn't found in religious slogans, it is found in ensuring that every Indian has a secure future so they can never be misled into violence. If we don't return to the Rule of Law now, we are simply waiting for our turn to reap a very bitter harvest. We Indians should wake up before our each and every religious and political class and their business class who are supporting radicalism is turning India into next Pakistan or worse. So uphold right values, principles, healthy religion and accountability of political parties all across.

**Also a NOTE To all our own NRI who are driven by religious and political delusion too,  Why the “Escape” Feels Safe Until It Isn’t**

This came to my thinking for a long time. We all can be sitting abroad, watching clips of the subcontinent unravel from the comfort of a high rise in New York, London, Toronto, or Sydney, it’s easy to feel detached. Pakistan is now living through the long term consequences of radicalization while many escaped to Dubai or other and being treated as slaves, or second class citizens there.    
  
Many countries from Asia, China, India, Srilanka, Bangladesh who move abroad looks like it’s being pulled into the same current. From a distance, it all feels like confirmation of a choice well made. I got out. I’m safe. My passport, my money, my legality will protect me.

That confidence is largely an illusion, more so a delusion. No matter how well you assimilate, how polished your accent becomes, or how economically “useful” you are, abroad you are still a minority. That fact doesn’t disappear just because you pay taxes or hold a white collar job. What’s more unsettling is how many NRIs, from this safe distance, actively cheer or fund radical politics back home, telling themselves they are protecting culture or identity. What they don’t see is that the same ideological winds are blowing everywhere now.   
  
The model minority myth is cracking in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia too, their people too hate each one of you coming to their country. You’re increasingly framed not as a professional, but as an outsider, a demographic problem, a job, cultural thief, nuisance, noise, radicals etc you all have seen it already on news. Western far right movements don’t care whether your radicalism back home is Hindu, Muslim, or something else entirely. To them, you are simply “the other.” You end up voting for radicalism in the place you left, while slowly becoming its victim in the place you fled to.

A lot of NRIs place blind faith in the strength of Western legal systems. They believe that institutions will always act neutrally and protect them. That belief ignores how law actually functions. Legal systems are not abstract machines. They are shaped by social sentiment, that same sentiment you fueled cheered back home haunts you where you stay too. When nationalism rises, and it is rising globally, minorities are always the easiest group to marginalize, corner, or discard. You are not woven into the cultural or historical fabric of these societies. You don’t have home field advantage. If the system turns, you are not treated like a stakeholder, you are treated like a variable more so fodder for them. And unlike earlier generations, you may not even have a strong community network to fall back on.

What feels particularly hollow is the way some NRIs enthusiastically support authoritarian or radical politics from the safety of a foreign zip code. Many NRIs even my friends I have seen celebrate policies that erode rule of law and constitutional values back home while thinking, let people there deal with the consequences, I have my dollars or pounds. This logic collapses the moment you look at it honestly.   
  
Capital does not stay where instability grows. If the country you call home becomes hostile, unpredictable, or economically fragile, you are not hurting some abstract group of people. You are actively destroying the only real fallback you ever had about your own self too wherever you live. The homeland you casually sabotage today is the place you may desperately need tomorrow.

There’s also a strange belief that wealth will insulate you from consequences. In reality, money often paints a target. When large sections of a population are kept uneducated, unemployed, and emotionally radicalized, they don’t look at wealthy returnees as success stories. They see symbols of abandonment. Same thing happened in Srilanka, have we all forgotten?   
  
If global anti immigrant sentiment continues to rise, and more people are forced to return, you won’t be welcomed as someone who “made it.” You’ll be seen as someone who escaped while others were left to suffer. Your wealth won’t protect you. It will make you visible and more seen as a soft target.

This isn’t about religion. Hindu, Muslim, Christian, it doesn’t matter. If you actively support the radicalization and brainwashing of your own society from abroad, you are not securing your future. You are undermining it from both ends. You are lighting a fire in your own house and convincing yourself that sleeping in the guest room makes you safe.

Hate doesn’t stay local anymore. Its consequences travel, economically, socially, politically. Whether it reaches you through hate crimes in a Western suburb or through a collapsed homeland that offers no return, the harvest always comes. So maybe it’s time to stop voting for destruction from a distance. Because when the world finally tells you to go back, you might realize there’s nothing left to go back to.",https://v.redd.it/cfege2yyincg1,"Why the whole South Asian subcontinent is at a Breaking Point of Hate through religion, political ideology, identity etc. 23 >English subtext"":

6,"It's not like he beats me, It's not verbal abuse either, should I still divorce him?",1q9popf,Divorce,2,13,2026-01-11 04:21:19,Dry-Connection2776,"I’m looking for ​an outside perspective because I’ve been questioning my reality for a long time.

I’ve been married for over eight years (married in 2017). I was 23 at the time; my husband is about five years older than me. We have one living child, and I recently lost a pregnancy under traumatic circumstances.



From the very beginning of our marriage, my husband has never slept next to me. I have slept alone in ​a bed for eight years. Initially, he said the bed was too firm and that he preferred the couch. At the time, I told myself this was just a difference in personality and that ​w​e dont have to have identical personalities. I minimized it.​ But this pattern of emotional and physical distance never changed.



My husband has always been extremely fearful and prone to panic. Small, solvable situations quickly escalate into worst-case scenarios. This panic spreads outward—to me, to both sets of parents, to friends—until every​one feels ​s​tress.



For example, he once canceled a pre-booked Napa tour because he convinced himself it might be a kidnapping scam. He was too afraid to drive himself, ​(he doesnt like driving) yet also too afraid to trust organized transportation.

  
This pattern has existed throughout our marriage and especially during our child’s early years. He would obsessively worry about our ​d​aughter's health, interpreting normal things as catastrophic diagnoses. I absorb stress easily, and living in a constant state of heightened fear has worn me down.



My coping style is to stay calm, problem-solve, and move forward. His is to panic, escalate, and catastrophize. Over time, ​l​istening to and having elevated stress levels has been exhausting.



I am an American citizen raised in ​O​hio. My husband was a green card holder when we married​, he became a U.S. citizen in early 2022.

A few weeks after his naturalization ceremony, ​m​y parents permanently retired to India. The very night ​m​y parents landed, he exploded at me while I was doing our child’s bedtime routine. He yelled, ​threatened to divorce me, and told me to leave the house—even saying I could “sleep on the road.”



​when he threatened to divorve me, i said ""what about another baby"", ""what about giving Trisha another sibling, they can have each other for the rest of their lives""? 

him: ""i will never have another child with you""

me: ""what""

him: ""i will never ever fucking have another child with you""

This was the night before our child’s first-ever day of daycare...

I was terrified. I called my parents​ and told them what had happened.. The next day, after my father sent a gentle voice message ​to my husband encouraging ​him to be more gentle with me and for use to communicate​e with each other and ""get-along"" , my husband screamed at me again—this time ​saying he's angry that my dad had the  audacity to advice him how to be. My husband yelled about ​how much money​ he makes, ​what his work status​ is,​ and ​got angry at me for“airing dirty laundry”​ to my parents. He said things like:



* “I make $500K—who does your dad think he is?”
* “You contribute nothing.​ Piece of shit”
* “You’re immature and stupid for telling anyone.”

I felt destabilized and afraid​ to file for divorce, I was so young at the time, scared. ​I thought I was stuck in this marriage. I hid my passport, he yelled at me and said that I am conniving and sneaky and have no moral compass because I put my passport in a different location than his. The truth is, I was trying to hide it because my parents had advised me to protect my and my daughters passport and birth certificate in case I needed to flee to another state or country. I thought I was stuck in this marriage because no one was helping me to get out. So fast-forward a year,  When we bought a home, I felt pressured and cornered​ because he said I'm a ""piece of shit"" for not contributing to the home. During arguments, he repeatedly told me I had no say because I “contributed nothing.”​ Eventually, I put in $​300,000 of my own money toward the down payment—largely out of fear and a need to prove my worth.



The house itself was entirely his choice. It was old and required nearly a year of renovation. Throughout this time, conflict was ​regular.



He frequently calls me selfish, transactional, and self-centered​, only caring about myself—even over mundane things, like furniture purchases. During one argument, when I ​said that he is “micromanaging,”​ me, he said that he would “hit me with a shoe.” That moment shocked me.

​When I gasped, he hit his own head with a​ p​lastic bowl hard enough to crack it. 



I had wanted another child ​since 2023. ​I waited to be pregnant until my daughter was older, I waited until the home renovation finished. When I finally became pregnant, I experienced bleeding early on. I had severe nausea that lasted 3 months. During this time, i continued to cook, clean, do dishes, take daughter to school, mow the lawn, mop the floors, and in those 3 months of my throwing up 4 times a day he never held my hand and comforted me while i was throwing up. He instead said ""our life was fine before you started this little project, you brought these troubles upon yourself"". H also jokingly said ""are you mad at the baby because it's giving you all this nausea"". To add to my misfortune, I later was diagnosed with a serious pregnancy complication​. Doctors explained there were ​life changing risks but that close monitoring was possible.

​The doctors said that I would have to come to the hospital every 2 weeks for monitoring, that was a 1.5 hour drive from my home, which I said was not a big deal because this baby was supposed to be worth it, it is a human life, afterall. He said ""oh we gotta drive 1.5 hours going and 1.5 coming, that's a whole 3 hours each time we have to go, and ohhh if we have to live there, we have to pay rent at an apartment, oh our daughter Trisha's summer will get ruined. If the baby is born too early, it could be born with life limiting disabilities, maybe asthma, or autism. We never know.""

My husband fixated on worst-case outcomes and insisted on termination. He became angry whenever I asked doctors clarifying questions, becasue he worried the doctors would take back their offer to terminate the pregnancy. He said ""God is giving us an opportunity out of a possibly horribly future, maybe this is a sign, maybe god wants us to terminate this pregnancy"".  



Whenever i tried to speak with the doctors to ask if we could extend the pregnancy to do more tests and scanning so we could make this baby survive, those stupid effing doctors would say to me ""Um, is your husband there, could you get him on the call too so we can all be there and hear the same thing?"" 

  
A​f​ter my pregnancy medical diagnosis, he told me that when I first ​t​old him I was pregnant​ he prayed ""god, if there ​i​s anything wrong with the baby, ​please make it become a miscarriage​"".



Eventually, under immense pressure and fear, I ​reluctantly agreed to terminate a pregnancy that doctors had told me was my last pregnancy​ every in my entire life.



The day of the procedure, I cried uncontrollably and said I wanted to leave. He insisted I continue. Afterward, while I was recovering in the hospital, he went back to casually talking with friends about work and politics​, real estate, just like it was any other regular Tuesday. they removed my uterus, i will never have another baby in my life again, and he was talking on the phone with his friends about work and politics​, real estate.

At home, I resumed cooking, cleaning, childcare, and household duties almost immediately. When he previously had back pain, I had literally spoon-fed him.​ Literally, made him dinner and fed him with a spoon because his arms couldn't move. After my surgery and loss, I was largely alone.

Three days later, my body began producing breast milk. I stood at the sink, crying, pouring it down the drain—knowing I would never carry another child ​in my entire existence on planet earth, ever again. I would never breastfeed, ever again. ever. 



When I later expressed how pressured and coerced I felt, he said:

  
“It’s not like I held you by the neck and dragged you to the hospital. You walked in​to there yourself.”

​He said ""if it were me, if i were carrying the baby, i would have fought harder for it""   
  
That sentence shattered my trust in my own perception. It made me question my reality.

here's the kicker.....two weeks after my loss, he approached me on several occasions wanting to have sex, I felt disgusted. My child is dead and he is horny????



Is it because I am a woman and biologically, hormonally, I am connected to my baby in my belly - and as a man, he just cannot understand my maternal desires to have a baby? is that why he doesn't understand my grief for the baby I lost forever 2 week ago? 

For eight years, I have done nearly all household labor and childcare. I wake up ​a​t 7, go to bed ​a​t 11:30 every single day,​ I mow the lawn, I cook breakfast, lunch, dinner, I have a job, I take my daugher to school, I give her a bath, I do homework with her, I mop the floors, I sweep, I make the bed, I do laundry, I clean the kitchen, I manage everything.



I cry daily. He sees it and walks away. He does not comfort me, touch my shoulder, or acknowledge my grief. He believes emotions are a waste of time and that success is money, stocks, and career status.



I ​sing and he has never once complimented me while every friend and family has. from the embarrassment I have from his lack of a response, I have stopped sharing my interests, my singing, my thoughts—because I am met with silence or dismissal​. I have lived eight years of marriage alone​ with my daughter.



I am in ​grief therapy. I am exhausted. I feel emotionally abandoned, and deeply lonely.



Sometimes I wonder if I should ignore my unhappiness, focus on work, learn a hobby, and present as a “successful couple” because ​h​e pays the bills.

Other times, I think: I already live like a single parent. I already carry everything. Wouldn’t peace, dignity, and emotional safety matter more?

So I’m asking honestly:​ 

Am I overreacting​? 

I am not looking to punish anyone. I am trying to understand if what I’ve lived through is enough to justify leaving.

7,"​It's not like he beats me, It's not verbal abuse either, should I still divorce him?",1q9pmlm,abusiverelationships,7,14,2026-01-11 04:18:31,Dry-Connection2776,"I’m looking for ​an outside perspective because I’ve been questioning my reality for a long time.

I’ve been married for over eight years (married in 2017). I was 23 at the time; my husband is about five years older than me. We have one living child, and I recently lost a pregnancy under traumatic circumstances.



From the very beginning of our marriage, my husband has never slept next to me. I have slept alone in ​a bed for eight years. Initially, he said the bed was too firm and that he preferred the couch. At the time, I told myself this was just a difference in personality and that ​w​e dont have to have identical personalities. I minimized it.​ But this pattern of emotional and physical distance never changed.



My husband has always been extremely fearful and prone to panic. Small, solvable situations quickly escalate into worst-case scenarios. This panic spreads outward—to me, to both sets of parents, to friends—until every​one feels ​s​tress.



For example, he once canceled a pre-booked Napa tour because he convinced himself it might be a kidnapping scam. He was too afraid to drive himself, ​(he doesnt like driving) yet also too afraid to trust organized transportation.

  
This pattern has existed throughout our marriage and especially during our child’s early years. He would obsessively worry about our ​d​aughter's health, interpreting normal things as catastrophic diagnoses. I absorb stress easily, and living in a constant state of heightened fear has worn me down.



My coping style is to stay calm, problem-solve, and move forward. His is to panic, escalate, and catastrophize. Over time, ​l​istening to and having elevated stress levels has been exhausting.



I am an American citizen raised in ​O​hio. My husband was a green card holder when we married​, he became a U.S. citizen in early 2022.  


A few weeks after his naturalization ceremony, ​m​y parents permanently retired to India. The very night ​m​y parents landed, he exploded at me while I was doing our child’s bedtime routine. He yelled, ​threatened to divorce me, and told me to leave the house—even saying I could “sleep on the road.”



​when he threatened to divorve me, i said ""what about another baby"", ""what about giving Trisha another sibling, they can have each other for the rest of their lives""? 

him: ""i will never have another child with you""

me: ""what""

him: ""i will never ever fucking have another child with you""

This was the night before our child’s first-ever day of daycare...

I was terrified. I called my parents​ and told them what had happened.. The next day, after my father sent a gentle voice message ​to my husband encouraging ​him to be more gentle with me and for use to communicate​e with each other and ""get-along"" , my husband screamed at me again—this time ​saying he's angry that my dad had the  audacity to advice him how to be. My husband yelled about ​how much money​ he makes, ​what his work status​ is,​ and ​got angry at me for“airing dirty laundry”​ to my parents. He said things like:



* “I make $500K—who does your dad think he is?”
* “You contribute nothing.​ Piece of shit”
* “You’re immature and stupid for telling anyone.”

I felt destabilized and afraid​ to file for divorce, I was so young at the time, scared. ​I thought I was stuck in this marriage. I hid my passport, he yelled at me and said that I am conniving and sneaky and have no moral compass because I put my passport in a different location than his. The truth is, I was trying to hide it because my parents had advised me to protect my and my daughters passport and birth certificate in case I needed to flee to another state or country. I thought I was stuck in this marriage because no one was helping me to get out. So fast-forward a year,  When we bought a home, I felt pressured and cornered​ because he said I'm a ""piece of shit"" for not contributing to the home. During arguments, he repeatedly told me I had no say because I “contributed nothing.”​ Eventually, I put in $​300,000 of my own money toward the down payment—largely out of fear and a need to prove my worth.



The house itself was entirely his choice. It was old and required nearly a year of renovation. Throughout this time, conflict was ​regular.



He frequently calls me selfish, transactional, and self-centered​, only caring about myself—even over mundane things, like furniture purchases. During one argument, when I ​said that he is “micromanaging,”​ me, he said that he would “hit me with a shoe.” That moment shocked me.

​When I gasped, he hit his own head with a​ p​lastic bowl hard enough to crack it. 



I had wanted another child ​since 2023. ​I waited to be pregnant until my daughter was older, I waited until the home renovation finished. When I finally became pregnant, I experienced bleeding early on. I had severe nausea that lasted 3 months. During this time, i continued to cook, clean, do dishes, take daughter to school, mow the lawn, mop the floors, and in those 3 months of my throwing up 4 times a day he never held my hand and comforted me while i was throwing up. He instead said ""our life was fine before you started this little project, you brought these troubles upon yourself"". H also jokingly said ""are you mad at the baby because it's giving you all this nausea"". To add to my misfortune, I later was diagnosed with a serious pregnancy complication​. Doctors explained there were ​life changing risks but that close monitoring was possible.

​The doctors said that I would have to come to the hospital every 2 weeks for monitoring, that was a 1.5 hour drive from my home, which I said was not a big deal because this baby was supposed to be worth it, it is a human life, afterall. He said ""oh we gotta drive 1.5 hours going and 1.5 coming, that's a whole 3 hours each time we have to go, and ohhh if we have to live there, we have to pay rent at an apartment, oh our daughter Trisha's summer will get ruined. If the baby is born too early, it could be born with life limiting disabilities, maybe asthma, or autism. We never know.""  


My husband fixated on worst-case outcomes and insisted on termination. He became angry whenever I asked doctors clarifying questions, becasue he worried the doctors would take back their offer to terminate the pregnancy. He said ""God is giving us an opportunity out of a possibly horribly future, maybe this is a sign, maybe god wants us to terminate this pregnancy"".  



Whenever i tried to speak with the doctors to ask if we could extend the pregnancy to do more tests and scanning so we could make this baby survive, those stupid effing doctors would say to me ""Um, is your husband there, could you get him on the call too so we can all be there and hear the same thing?"" 

  
A​f​ter my pregnancy medical diagnosis, he told me that when I first ​t​old him I was pregnant​ he prayed ""god, if there ​i​s anything wrong with the baby, ​please make it become a miscarriage​"".



Eventually, under immense pressure and fear, I ​reluctantly agreed to terminate a pregnancy that doctors had told me was my last pregnancy​ every in my entire life.



The day of the procedure, I cried uncontrollably and said I wanted to leave. He insisted I continue. Afterward, while I was recovering in the hospital, he went back to casually talking with friends about work and politics​, real estate, just like it was any other regular Tuesday. they removed my uterus, i will never have another baby in my life again, and he was talking on the phone with his friends about work and politics​, real estate.  


At home, I resumed cooking, cleaning, childcare, and household duties almost immediately. When he previously had back pain, I had literally spoon-fed him.​ Literally, made him dinner and fed him with a spoon because his arms couldn't move. After my surgery and loss, I was largely alone.  


Three days later, my body began producing breast milk. I stood at the sink, crying, pouring it down the drain—knowing I would never carry another child ​in my entire existence on planet earth, ever again. I would never breastfeed, ever again. ever. 



When I later expressed how pressured and coerced I felt, he said:

  
“It’s not like I held you by the neck and dragged you to the hospital. You walked in​to there yourself.”  


​He said ""if it were me, if i were carrying the baby, i would have fought harder for it""   
  
That sentence shattered my trust in my own perception. It made me question my reality.  


here's the kicker.....two weeks after my loss, he approached me on several occasions wanting to have sex, I felt disgusted. My child is dead and he is horny????



Is it because I am a woman and biologically, hormonally, I am connected to my baby in my belly - and as a man, he just cannot understand my maternal desires to have a baby? is that why he doesn't understand my grief for the baby I lost forever 2 week ago? 

For eight years, I have done nearly all household labor and childcare. I wake up ​a​t 7, go to bed ​a​t 11:30 every single day,​ I mow the lawn, I cook breakfast, lunch, dinner, I have a job, I take my daugher to school, I give her a bath, I do homework with her, I mop the floors, I sweep, I make the bed, I do laundry, I clean the kitchen, I manage everything.



I cry daily. He sees it and walks away. He does not comfort me, touch my shoulder, or acknowledge my grief. He believes emotions are a waste of time and that success is money, stocks, and career status.



I ​sing and he has never once complimented me while every friend and family has. from the embarrassment I have from his lack of a response, I have stopped sharing my interests, my singing, my thoughts—because I am met with silence or dismissal​. I have lived eight years of marriage alone​ with my daughter.

  


I am in ​grief therapy. I am exhausted. I feel emotionally abandoned, and deeply lonely.



Sometimes I wonder if I should ignore my unhappiness, focus on work, learn a hobby, and present as a “successful couple” because ​h​e pays the bills.  


Other times, I think: I already live like a single parent. I already carry everything. Wouldn’t peace, dignity, and emotional safety matter more?  


So I’m asking honestly:​ 

Am I overreacting​? 

I am not looking to punish anyone. I am trying to understand if what I’ve lived through is enough to justify leaving.

8,PSA - Some of the most commonly asked questions on the Subreddit,1q9onkp,PokemonTcgIndia,5,0,2026-01-11 03:30:47,MrBub_bles,"Hello all,

  
Happy Sunday. Great way to start the day with some light reading. The aim is to eventually make a FAQ section for the subreddit so that everyone, especially newcomers can make use of it. These are some of the most commonly asked questions on the sub.

  
1. Where can I buy genuine Pokémon cards in India?

There is no official distribution of Pokemon cards in India. Therefore, the community has to rely on websites run by small businesses or enthusiastic individuals to buy and sell genuine Pokemon products in India.

Please refer to the subreddit Megathread on genuine sellers in the community (**under construction\*\***). In meantime, please ask for names or use the subreddit search function.

Note: There will be a new subreddit Megathread which will have the names of some of the most highly recommended sellers and web-shops by the community members. This thread will also contain names of individual members who are already listed as trusted sellers on the subreddit.

This is being done because there are a lot of complaint being received about the 'pinned excel' list not being updated as frequently or containing incorrect information. The aim to to maintain a simplified database on the subreddit which can be constantly updated. If there are suggestions or concerns regarding this, please let the mod team know.

Important point to note: The subreddit does not guarantee transactions and is not responsible for disputes, losses, or scam. The subreddit is a facilitator which provides the platforms for buying / selling and trading. The individuals involved in the transactions are responsible for their own safety and safety of their money. Please, always do your own due diligence before purchasing.



  
2. Are Pokémon cards sold in local stationery shops genuine?

In most cases, no. Clear indicators include, very cheap packs, odd packaging, or unfamiliar brands.

If the price feels “too good to be true,” it usually is. When in doubt, ask the subreddit before buying, not after. You can take a simple picture of the local shop product and corss reference it with the subreddit.



  
3. How do I start collecting Pokémon cards in India?

Decide why you’re collecting and how do you want to collect. Do you want to:

\- Open packs?

\- Collect specific single cards?

\- Collect your favourite Pokemon or Artist?

\- Collect cards in a binder or graded cards?

To get started , do some personal research. Use resources like [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Browse:Trading_Card_Game) to learn about sets and the cards in them. You can also refer to [PokeBeach](https://www.pokebeach.com/) for news on the latest and greatest sets and get an overview on the cards released.





4. How can I avoid getting scammed while buying or trading?

Basic safety steps:

\- Ask for timestamped photos (username + date).

\- Request clear front & back images.

\- Avoid rushed deals or pressure tactics.

\- Use safe payment methods where possible.

\- Check seller history and community feedback. Ask if you have doubts or use the info in the Megathread (**under construction**\*\*)

If the seller cannot verify any of the details mentioned above, then do not agree to a deal. It is better to not buy the card than to loose your hard earned money.





5. Does this subreddit verify sellers or handle disputes?

The subreddit does try it's best to verify sellers on a surface level. The subreddit relies on vouches and references provided by the seller to verify the legitimacy of the seller. 

The subreddit or the mod team cannot settle any disputes that might happen in case a deal goes wrong. Transactions are entirely at your own risk.

Remember: Most individuals who sell and provide cards are students, regular office going individuals who have a daily job. Sometimes things happen which are not in control of the seller (issues with shipping, lost mail, damaged by courier company etc). If this happens in your case, please reach out to the seller directly via their communication channels to resolve the dispute. If the seller is unresponsive or dismissive, you can either contact the MOD team for mediation or suggestion, or post your experience review on the subreddit as a warning to others.

This helps make other community members aware of seller quality. 



  
6. Why are Pokémon cards so expensive in India?

There is no official Pokémon TCG distribution in India. Usually the prices of Pokemon cards in India are adding up the import costs, customs duties, and shipping charges.

Most products are brought in by resellers / web shops / individuals who also have to add their profit margins to keep things sustainable.



  
7. Should I buy sealed packs or singles?

There is no right and wrong answer to this question.

Singles are recommended for:

\- Specific Pokemon or Art that you would like to collect.

\- Binder collections or gaps in set collections.

\- Helps a lot if you are on a strict budget.

Sealed packs are:

\- For the joy and thrill of opening packs.

\- Luck-based and high risk

\- Mostly for fun or building a sense of community with other.

Open packs for enjoyment only and expect no returns.



  
8. Are graded cards worth buying in India?

Graded cards are a niche market in India due to the high price point. Most collectors prefer raw cards for binders since they are more budget friendly..

Slabs make sense for (from an Indian Perspective):

\- High-end vintage or limited release cards.

\- Iconic Pokémon

\- Long-term preservation or potential resale value if high grades.

However, do not assume graded means easy resale. The price of a high grade cards still makes it unfeasible for most Indian collectors to buy them. Grading is also subjective. 



  
9. How should I store my cards safely?

Recommended at a minimum, penny sleeves and decent to high quality side loading binders

Double sleeving is highly recommended for valuable or long-term card storgae and it also help prevent against dust, humidity and moisture. Use side loading binders for added protection.

Top loaders and Semi-Rigids can also be used fairly effectively but can be expensive and do not guarantee complete protection against moisture and humidity. They are an excellent way to ship your cards since they provide safety against impact damage.

Can I use ring binders?

Contrary to popular belief, ring binders, more specifically D ring binders are are safe for long term storage of cards. This is possible if you

\- Use D Ring Binders.

\- Do not overload your binder more than necessary.

\- Use patience and care while handling cards and turning pages.

\- Store the ring binders with the spine facing upwards. This ensures the weight and pressure of the cards and the pages away from the ring.

Remember, most damage of cards comes from improper handling of cards rather than the storage mechanics.



  
10. Can I post sales or trade listings here?

Yes, but, Follow the subreddit’s sale/trade rules. More specifically Rule no. 2

Always clearly mention:

\- Price

\- Condition

\- Shipping location

Use appropriate timestamped photos where relevant. Be transparent and responsive. Low-effort or misleading sales posts may be removed.



11. Why don’t we have official Pokémon events or leagues in India?

Pokémon TCG has no official organized play infrastructure in India yet. Any tournaments or events are community-run. Availability depends heavily on local organizers and stores. 

12. I’m new and afraid of asking “stupid questions.”

There are no stupid questions and you are always encouraged to ask when in doubt, but...

\- Please search the subreddit first. The question you are searching for may have already been answered by the community.

\- Read pinned posts and FAQs.

= Ask clearly and politely.

A good question helps everyone and can also help not only new members but also veterans who may think differently.



Are any questions missed? Are any of the answers different to what you know or what you understand. Please give feedback on the same. If there are better ways to do something, always, always take time to suggest it either via DM or Modmail. We are always open to discuss.

\*\*About Me\*\*

35, cis female, 165 cm tall. Medium ugly, with curly grey hair. Maharashtrian, working in tech. I love working out—strength training, hiking, and my newfound passions for calisthenics, yoga, and long runs (a noob at the last three).

Fluent in Marathi, Hindi, and English. I quit German and Spanish after A2 level. 😢 I can read Gujarati and understand it fairly well, plus some Punjabi and Marwadi from growing up in a multicultural neighborhood.

Be my accountability buddy. 🤞

Reason for being CF - Want more money, travel and Peace ✌🏻 


Eggitarian (your diet doesn't concern me). Non-smoker, non-drinker, no drugs of any kind—this is non-negotiable. Sorry for being old-school.

\*\*Family\*\*: Quite distant from mine for my own mental peace. Plus point: you won't have to deal with them. 😂 

Caste - Kunbi (OBC) if it matters to you.
Astrology - I am Manglik, this means nothing to me, for your info if you who believe in astrology 

\*\*Work & Finance\*\*: Pretty average at work, not career-ambitious—that's why I still make <30 LPA. Saving and investing aggressively—what if AI makes me jobless? No inheritance to fall back on.

Have mortgage for my 2bhk in rural Pune,  self sufficient to clear it in next few years. 

\*\*Side Hustle\*\*: Certified online fitness coach—money's limited for now, but hoping to grow it. 🧿

\*\*Travel\*\*: 10 Himalayan treks and 70+ hikes in Maharashtra. 14 countries (I started late and travel slow). Unless I climb a few mountains, my itinerary feels incomplete. Most of my travels been solo, would love a company who enjoys it as much as I do.

\*\*Personality\*\*: Quiet or chatty depending on the company, but always direct—no drama or BS. Organized; Sundays are for deep cleaning, gardening, and meal prep. Dog lover—I don't hate cats but prefer not to be around them.

\*\*Political & Religious Views\*\*: I dislike both. If you're a fanboy for any leader, stay an ultra-marathon away. Special disdain for andhbhakts—block me now. Born and raised Hindu, turned atheist during COVID. I don't care about your views unless forced on me. I do love celebrating Gudhi Padwa, Diwali, and Christmas.

\*\*Expectations\*\*

- Age range +- 3-4 years. No chronic or serious diseases

\- Working in a private job or business (remote work is a huge plus—it's my dream for traveling and living abroad).


\- I may move countries; India feels like a scam. As someone who prioritizes health, even low-AQI places can't escape water pollution and food adulteration—plus 30% tax for this? Hell no!


\- Not overly religious, independent decision-maker, empathetic, dog lover.
- At least 5'10"" (no heels 😂).


\- Regular workouts; love for hiking and camping is a \*must\*.


\- I find cooking meditative and often host 20+ people, so expect you to help with grocery shopping and cleaning.


\- Goes without saying: alpha, macho Kabir-sing types—this isn't your Preeti.


\- Hard no: past or present casual hookups or high body count—please avoid.

My DMs are closed, so if you hide your posts or comments, sorry—I won't respond.

\*14th Feb is also my 36th birthday. 🥲🥹

**Ethan Hamish, Project Helios Assistant Director**

*January 15th, 2149*



Giving up Venus in exchange for faster-than-light travel. The Gifrid proposition had reverberated across the Earth like a shockwave. When the UN released the meeting’s official transcript, protests and debates lit up all around the globe. Some economists called it ‘the deal of the millennium’ and a model for mutually-beneficial exchange. Many at the pulpits said it was a faustian bargain—trading away creation for our own selfish advancement. In the end, however, the numbers spoke for themselves. FTL travel offered the kind of seemingly-limitless growth that could only be dreamt of with humanity confined to Earth. Even among more conservative nations, the promise of cheaper goods and millions lifted out of poverty was simply too good to pass up. 



And so, on June 4th, 2148, the United Nations officially ratified the Venus Agreement, with all member nations formally agreeing to abdicate whatever claims they may have had to Venus in exchange for Gifrid technology. Of course there was some political arm-twisting involved to get the stragglers to sign on—something I personally was much too excited by the sheer momentous weight of the occasion to care about. Within a week of us receiving the blueprints and documentation, experts from all across the globe were brought together with a singular purpose in mind—to build humanity’s first interstellar craft. As Scotland’s foremost physicist, I was among the first humans honored with a glimpse of the schematics. 



For two months, the best scientists and engineers Earth had to offer—myself included—poured over the blueprints in search of understanding. Fundamentally, FTL engines only really required two things to function: a power source and a specific type of exotic matter named ‘ahex’ by the Gifrid. For power sources, most ships used either antimatter batteries or fusion reactors—larger vessels generally tended toward the latter, while smaller ones used the former. Fortunately, Thivel’s promise included schematics for everything we’d need, including early designs for both of these engine types. 



“They just handed us the secrets of antimatter on a silver platter, and it’s not even the main course…” noted Rakesh—an engineer from India. His awe had been justified, of course. Gifrid methods of antimatter production and containment were impressive to say the least—hundreds of years ahead of even our most cutting-edge stuff. Then again, I suppose that was to be expected from a species with physicists older than our modern conceptions of physics.



While the engineers were mainly focused on understanding the fueling and propulsion methods of Gifrid ships, the physicists—myself included—spent the next month after the reveal pouring over the provided information on exotic matter. In their centuries of research and cooperation with other species, the Gifrid had discovered various types of exotic matter that seemed to defy physics as we understood it. Ahex particles were widely regarded as the most important type of exotic matter for galactic civilization. Somehow, the mass of these particles could be altered significantly based on surrounding conditions, allowing them to exert disproportionate, or even negative, gravitational force. For a room full of top physicists who’d spent most of their lives fantasizing about this exact technology, the applications were immediately obvious. 



Running the calculations for the fifteenth time, it felt like I was waking up from a dream only to find the fantasy of it alive and well. All the math checked out. If we could manufacture half a metric ton of ahex, we could create a genuine faster-than-light engine. It wouldn’t be cheap, but with Gifrid manufacturing methods we could create a single functional drive in a matter of months. Obviously, just about every nation wanted their own FTL flagship, but the infrastructure required to truly mass-produce ahex would take years to properly set up on Earth, so we’d have to settle for the moment on a single UN-owned ship—the Helios.



What followed was the most ambitious international project to ever take place. Nations all around the world poured an appreciable percentage of their budgets into supplying our team, thousands strong, with resources we needed to build a ship worthy of representing humanity. This ship, a diplomatic and research vessel first and foremost, was to be the largest singular object ever launched into space by humanity. Walking through the half-finished halls of the vessel alongside others in the project, I could scarcely believe how quickly this was all coming together. 



“We’re set to be operational by the end of March,” explained Gary—the project’s director. Compared to previous spacecraft, the Helios was to be an upgrade in every aspect. Artificial gravity generators and inertial dampeners allowed for much more earthlike luxury than its predecessors. Cutting-edge labs and a diplomatic suite for business with a fully-stocked bar and an indoor pool for pleasure. 



Working on the Helios was an honor, but that day in particular I had something else on my mind—as did just about everyone else on earth. The Gifrid colonization vessel was set to arrive on Venus the next day alongside a diplomatic vessel sent to Earth by their leader—the Grand Executive. The meeting was to be broadcast all over the world—it was the first time we’d be meeting aliens face to face. For their safety, the Gifrid would be wearing environmental suits. As assistant Overseer to project Helios, I was again honored by the UN with an opportunity to be there in person: a chance I jumped at.



The plane ride to New York City was more packed than I had been expecting. In the interest of keeping the skies clear for the Gifrid vessel’s arrival, nearby airports would be closed down on the day of the true first contact, so I suppose it only made sense that people would want to get their flights in before then. Popping in my noise-canceling headphones, I listened to a pre-recorded podcast from renowned science communicator Jordan Hathrow. As a famous biochemist, he was one of the only civilian individuals given early access to the Gifrid biology dossiers. Now that they were mostly public, he had released four one-hour episodes just digging into the rudimentary details of how silicon biology worked. I was no biologist myself, but Hathrow was able to break down his findings rather well into digestible information.



From biology to physics to sociology, the scientific community as a whole went into enthusiastic overdrive when the dossiers were finally released. Like a colony of ants flooding to a droplet of melted ice cream, the greatest minds of Earth lapped up all the information they could from those files. Perhaps even more euphoric than the knowledge itself was knowing that it was only the tip of the iceberg. There was so much more to come. 



Given that the UN embassy lacked a landing space that could accommodate the Gifrid’s massive vessel, arrangements were made for the JFK International Airport to be used instead. Touching down in New York City, I made my way to the hotel selected for me and attempted to get some rest as the exhaustion of work warred internally with my excitement for the historic event to come.



The next morning, I made my way back to the airport, where a terminal had been set up to serve as our conference room. Presenting my identification and navigating slowly through the half-dozen security checkpoints, I eventually found myself on the other side and was greeted with a sea of faces familiar and otherwise. Looking up at the second floor, I caught a glimpse of several world leaders conferring in hushed tones. Meanwhile on the main floor, scientists and academics of every discipline conferred excitedly with one another, each discussing their theories and findings. Outside the terminal itself, where a runway awaited the arrival of the Gifrid ship, over a hundred media representatives kept their cameras firmly trained upon where the ship was supposed to land. 



“Any minute now…” I heard from Claire Bouchard—an astrobiologist of some renown from Canada. Of all the scientific disciplines rocked by first contact, biology was rivaled only by physics in how much upheaval was being seen. Along with their diplomats, the Gifrid would be bringing samples of their cells for joint UN labs—something that those in related disciplines were salivating over. 



“Hard to believe first contact was half a year ago,” I began, approaching Claire and offering her a handshake before continuing. “Seems like it was only yesterday we got that signal from space.”



Reaching out to reciprocate my gesture, Claire nodded affirmatively. “You wouldn’t believe how many papers have already been written on silicon biochemistry. My colleagues have been near-feral with speculation. I actually published a few myself.”



“If you think they’re excited, you should see the physics community!” I retorted, recalling the dozens of correspondences I’d received from other physicists seeking my input on their papers. “This upheaval is bigger than Einstein and Hawking combined.” 



Ambling over to a nearby vending machine alongside Bouchard and retrieving two non-alcoholic beverages, I handed one over to Claire and walked with her to a nearby table set up not far from the doors leading outside to the landing pad. 



Taking out my cell phone and opening up the news, I saw live footage of what was happening outside past the barricades. Waves of protestors and sightseers crushed up against each other with signs and cameras respectively. The Venus Agreement had not passed without controversy, and many people were yet to get over it. *“Pincers off Venus!”* Proclaimed one sign, its creator mistaken in their assumption that we could stop the Gifrid from simply taking it if they so chose. In all honesty, I hadn’t expected the first alien civilization we met to be so *reasonable*. The fact that they were willing to negotiate with us rather than simply take what they wanted was contrary to theories like the Dark Forest. As someone who had pondered the question of extraterrestrial life many times myself, I’d half-expected our first contact would be with a weapon rather than an exploration vessel.



As promised, the Gifrid broadcasted codes to the world’s militaries once they were in Mars range, prompting missile defense systems to stand down. “The Gifrid vessel Duhis is officially approaching Earth!” Shouted the American Secretary of Defense, eliciting cheers from around the room and more conspiratorial glances from up top. 



Less than an hour later, everyone in the room watched as the clouds above parted to make way for the kilometer-long Gifrid vessel. Apparently, this was nowhere near their largest warship, but it was the biggest one that the UN was comfortable having near our planet for defense coordination purposes. The diplomats and military personnel onboard were part of an official Earth liaison chosen by their Grand Executive, and as such spoke with far more authority than Thivel had as captain of an exploration vessel. 



Armed personnel formed a perimeter to keep everyone from swarming as they rolled out the proverbial red carpet for the Gifrid, lining up on either side of the vessel’s off ramp as it slowly lowered. Cameras and microphones from media representatives were held just barely past the perimeter as the first Gifrid on Earth majestically paraded themselves out, immediately being met by world leaders. 



It was one thing to be told how large these creatures were or to infer it from the footage, but another thing entirely to see them in person. The Gifrid standing before us was easily over four meters long, their crystalline body encased in a clear bodysuit that revealed their illuminated form. “Hello, Humans of Earth,” it began, lifting more of its elongated body off the ground until it was around eight feet high. “My name is Xivis. I have been personally tasked by the Grand Executive in diplomatically leading our liaison to your… Lovely planet.” There was hesitation in that last part that even the translation device picked up on—a tacit reminder that from their perspective we lived in a frozen hell.



First among the world leaders to approach Xivis for a handshake was Secretary General Vasel, who reached out her hand somewhat hesitantly. Xivis for their part seemed confused at first by the gesture, simply staring at the appendage as though waiting for it to do something. Finally, after a few more awkward seconds, Vasel informed them of the human custom of shaking hands—something which Xivis seemed hesitant to do. “Do inform me if my pincers inadvertently harm you,” they began, reaching one with one of their fine manipulator claws and allowing Vasel to shake it up and down. 



One by one, more world leaders followed her lead and approached to shake Xivis’ ‘hand’, each one holding the gesture for long enough that it could be caught by cameras from all angles. Once the formalities concluded, Xivis spoke into his comms device and half a dozen other Gifrid exited the ship. Each of these Gifrid subsequently introduced themselves as experts in a variety of fields. One of them—their biology expert—was carrying a box that looked like a miniature oven. Immediately upon that one’s entrance into the terminal, I watched as Bouchard and other biologists practically swarmed them. “These are the samples you requested,” said the Gifrid, gently placing the container down onto a table. “We designed it specially to remain within acceptable temperature ranges on its outside whilst keeping Gifrid cells inside of it alive. It also comes complete with an analytical suite. I trust you have brought the cells you promised in exchange, yes?”



As a UN coordinator rushed to retrieve our promised samples—none of them Human for security reasons, though the Gifrid didn’t seem to care so long as they were carbon based—Bouchard approached the Gifrid biologist and offered her own hand to shake. “Ebsu,” Claire almost stuttered with excitement as she spoke the Gifrid’s name. “We look forward to cooperating with you in our research on the intricacies of life in our galaxy.”



“Likewise,” Ebsu replied politely, raising themselves up further—a gesture which seemed to intimidate some of the closer biologists. “Apoligies…” They chittered, noting the discomfort around the gesture. “My people evolved from ambush predators. Making ourselves large and seen is viewed not as a threat in our culture but as a show of honesty.”



That seemed to calm the group at least slightly as they all discussed (read: argued) amongst themselves who should get the first look at Gifrid cells.

As a UN coordinator rushed to retrieve our promised samples—none of them Human for security reasons, though the Gifrid didn’t seem to care so long as they were carbon based—Bouchard approached the Gifrid biologist and offered her own hand to shake. “Ebsu,” Claire almost stuttered with excitement as she spoke the Gifrid’s name. “We look forward to cooperating with you in our research on the intricacies of life in our galaxy.”



“Likewise,” Ebsu replied politely, raising themselves up further—a gesture which seemed to intimidate some of the closer biologists. “Apoligies…” They chittered, noting the discomfort around the gesture. “My people evolved from ambush predators. Making ourselves large and seen is viewed not as a threat in our culture but as a show of honesty.”



That seemed to calm the group at least slightly as they all discussed (read: argued) amongst themselves who should get the first look at Gifrid cells.",the impossible planet first ethan hamish project helios assistant director january th giving up venus in exchange for faster than light travel the gifrid proposition had reverberated across the earth like a shockwave when the un released the meeting s official transcript protests and debates lit up all around the globe some economists called it the deal of the millennium and a model for mutually beneficial exchange many at the pulpits said it was a faustian bargain trading away creation for our own selfish advancement in the end however the numbers spoke for themselves ftl travel offered the kind of seemingly limitless growth that could only be dreamt of with humanity confined to earth even among more conservative nations the promise of cheaper goods and millions lifted out of poverty was simply too good to pass up and so on june th the united nations officially ratified the venus agreement with all member nations formally agreeing to abdicate whatever claims they may have had to venus in exchange for gifrid technology of course there was some political arm twisting involved to get the stragglers to sign on something i personally was much too excited by the sheer momentous weight of the occasion to care about within a week of us receiving the blueprints and documentation experts from all across the globe were brought together with a singular purpose in mind to build humanity s first interstellar craft as scotland s foremost physicist i was among the first humans honored with a glimpse of the schematics for two months the best scientists and engineers earth had to offer myself included poured over the blueprints in search of understanding fundamentally ftl engines only really required two things to function a power source and a specific type of exotic matter named ahex by the gifrid for power sources most ships used either antimatter batteries or fusion reactors larger vessels generally tended toward the latter while smaller ones used the former fortunately thivel s promise included schematics for everything we d need including early designs for both of these engine types they just handed us the secrets of antimatter on a silver platter and it s not even the main course noted rakesh an engineer from india his awe had been justified of course gifrid methods of antimatter production and containment were impressive to say the least hundreds of years ahead of even our most cutting edge stuff then again i suppose that was to be expected from a species with physicists older than our modern conceptions of physics while the engineers were mainly focused on understanding the fueling and propulsion methods of gifrid ships the physicists myself included spent the next month after the reveal pouring over the provided information on exotic matter in their centuries of research and cooperation with other species the gifrid had discovered various types of exotic matter that seemed to defy physics as we understood it ahex particles were widely regarded as the most important type of exotic matter for galactic civilization somehow the mass of these particles could be altered significantly based on surrounding conditions allowing them to exert disproportionate or even negative gravitational force for a room full of top physicists who d spent most of their lives fantasizing about this exact technology the applications were immediately obvious running the calculations for the fifteenth time it felt like i was waking up from a dream only to find the fantasy of it alive and well all the math checked out if we could manufacture half a metric ton of ahex we could create a genuine faster than light engine it wouldn t be cheap but with gifrid manufacturing methods we could create a single functional drive in a matter of months obviously just about every nation wanted their own ftl flagship but the infrastructure required to truly mass produce ahex would take years to properly set up on earth so we d have to settle for the moment on a single un owned ship the helios what followed was the most ambitious international project to ever take place nations all around the world poured an appreciable percentage of their budgets into supplying our team thousands strong with resources we needed to build a ship worthy of representing humanity this ship a diplomatic and research vessel first and foremost was to be the largest singular object ever launched into space by humanity walking through the half finished halls of the vessel alongside others in the project i could scarcely believe how quickly this was all coming together we re set to be operational by the end of march explained gary the project s director compared to previous spacecraft the helios was to be an upgrade in every aspect artificial gravity generators and inertial dampeners allowed for much more earthlike luxury than its predecessors cutting edge labs and a diplomatic suite for business with a fully stocked bar and an indoor pool for pleasure working on the helios was an honor but that day in particular i had something else on my mind as did just about everyone else on earth the gifrid colonization vessel was set to arrive on venus the next day alongside a diplomatic vessel sent to earth by their leader the grand executive the meeting was to be broadcast all over the world it was the first time we d be meeting aliens face to face for their safety the gifrid would be wearing environmental suits as assistant overseer to project helios i was again honored by the un with an opportunity to be there in person a chance i jumped at the plane ride to new york city was more packed than i had been expecting in the interest of keeping the skies clear for the gifrid vessel s arrival nearby airports would be closed down on the day of the true first contact so i suppose it only made sense that people would want to get their flights in before then popping in my noise canceling headphones i listened to a pre recorded podcast from renowned science communicator jordan hathrow as a famous biochemist he was one of the only civilian individuals given early access to the gifrid biology dossiers now that they were mostly public he had released four one hour episodes just digging into the rudimentary details of how silicon biology worked i was no biologist myself but hathrow was able to break down his findings rather well into digestible information from biology to physics to sociology the scientific community as a whole went into enthusiastic overdrive when the dossiers were finally released like a colony of ants flooding to a droplet of melted ice cream the greatest minds of earth lapped up all the information they could from those files perhaps even more euphoric than the knowledge itself was knowing that it was only the tip of the iceberg there was so much more to come given that the un embassy lacked a landing space that could accommodate the gifrid s massive vessel arrangements were made for the jfk international airport to be used instead touching down in new york city i made my way to the hotel selected for me and attempted to get some rest as the exhaustion of work warred internally with my excitement for the historic event to come the next morning i made my way back to the airport where a terminal had been set up to serve as our conference room presenting my identification and navigating slowly through the half dozen security checkpoints i eventually found myself on the other side and was greeted with a sea of faces familiar and otherwise looking up at the second floor i caught a glimpse of several world leaders conferring in hushed tones meanwhile on the main floor scientists and academics of every discipline conferred excitedly with one another each discussing their theories and findings outside the terminal itself where a runway awaited the arrival of the gifrid ship over a hundred media representatives kept their cameras firmly trained upon where the ship was supposed to land any minute now i heard from claire bouchard an astrobiologist of some renown from canada of all the scientific disciplines rocked by first contact biology was rivaled only by physics in how much upheaval was being seen along with their diplomats the gifrid would be bringing samples of their cells for joint un labs something that those in related disciplines were salivating over hard to believe first contact was half a year ago i began approaching claire and offering her a handshake before continuing seems like it was only yesterday we got that signal from space reaching out to reciprocate my gesture claire nodded affirmatively you wouldn t believe how many papers have already been written on silicon biochemistry my colleagues have been near feral with speculation i actually published a few myself if you think they re excited you should see the physics community i retorted recalling the dozens of correspondences i d received from other physicists seeking my input on their papers this upheaval is bigger than einstein and hawking combined ambling over to a nearby vending machine alongside bouchard and retrieving two non alcoholic beverages i handed one over to claire and walked with her to a nearby table set up not far from the doors leading outside to the landing pad taking out my cell phone and opening up the news i saw live footage of what was happening outside past the barricades waves of protestors and sightseers crushed up against each other with signs and cameras respectively the venus agreement had not passed without controversy and many people were yet to get over it pincers off venus proclaimed one sign its creator mistaken in their assumption that we could stop the gifrid from simply taking it if they so chose in all honesty i hadn t expected the first alien civilization we met to be so reasonable the fact that they were willing to negotiate with us rather than simply take what they wanted was contrary to theories like the dark forest as someone who had pondered the question of extraterrestrial life many times myself i d half expected our first contact would be with a weapon rather than an exploration vessel as promised the gifrid broadcasted codes to the world s militaries once they were in mars range prompting missile defense systems to stand down the gifrid vessel duhis is officially approaching earth shouted the american secretary of defense eliciting cheers from around the room and more conspiratorial glances from up top less than an hour later everyone in the room watched as the clouds above parted to make way for the kilometer long gifrid vessel apparently this was nowhere near their largest warship but it was the biggest one that the un was comfortable having near our planet for defense coordination purposes the diplomats and military personnel onboard were part of an official earth liaison chosen by their grand executive and as such spoke with far more authority than thivel had as captain of an exploration vessel armed personnel formed a perimeter to keep everyone from swarming as they rolled out the proverbial red carpet for the gifrid lining up on either side of the vessel s off ramp as it slowly lowered cameras and microphones from media representatives were held just barely past the perimeter as the first gifrid on earth majestically paraded themselves out immediately being met by world leaders it was one thing to be told how large these creatures were or to infer it from the footage but another thing entirely to see them in person the gifrid standing before us was easily over four meters long their crystalline body encased in a clear bodysuit that revealed their illuminated form hello humans of earth it began lifting more of its elongated body off the ground until it was around eight feet high my name is xivis i have been personally tasked by the grand executive in diplomatically leading our liaison to your lovely planet there was hesitation in that last part that even the translation device picked up on a tacit reminder that from their perspective we lived in a frozen hell first among the world leaders to approach xivis for a handshake was secretary general vasel who reached out her hand somewhat hesitantly xivis for their part seemed confused at first by the gesture simply staring at the appendage as though waiting for it to do something finally after a few more awkward seconds vasel informed them of the human custom of shaking hands something which xivis seemed hesitant to do do inform me if my pincers inadvertently harm you they began reaching one with one of their fine manipulator claws and allowing vasel to shake it up and down one by one more world leaders followed her lead and approached to shake xivis hand each one holding the gesture for long enough that it could be caught by cameras from all angles once the formalities concluded xivis spoke into his comms device and half a dozen other gifrid exited the ship each of these gifrid subsequently introduced themselves as experts in a variety of fields one of them their biology expert was carrying a box that looked like a miniature oven immediately upon that one s entrance into the terminal i

12,Chinese-Language Opinion on Iran: Misconceptions—Stereotypes Undervalue Reality; Iran Under Clerical Rule Still Has Some Democracy and Achievements; U.S./Israeli Intervention Exploits Crisis. Iran Needs More Democracy and Human Rights—Judge Facts Objectively,1q9kkls,China,0,4,2026-01-11 00:27:25,Slow-Property5895,"Recently, Israel has launched large-scale attacks on Iran, Iran has retaliated, and the United States has also directly intervened, causing the situation to deteriorate rapidly. This has drawn global attention to Iran, and China and the Chinese-language public sphere are no exception. Within Chinese-language discourse, debates over the Israel–Iran conflict and Iran-related issues have been particularly intense. Different groups, to varying degrees, project many Iranian events and figures onto China-related issues, interpreting and commenting on them through their own positions and value systems, based on their respective perceptions and imaginations.

However, these commentaries are often highly subjective and shaped by preconceived notions. They frequently involve misperceptions of Iran and the Israel–Iran conflict, neglect or exaggeration of facts, and distortions of right and wrong, resulting in various misunderstandings and misconceptions. Here, the author seeks to enumerate some of these misunderstandings and to clarify the issues and facts involved.

First, many people simply regard Iran as an authoritarian and totalitarian state, believing that its regime or ruling group is dictatorial, commits all manner of evils, and stands in complete opposition to its people. They equate it with regimes such as North Korea’s Kim family rule or the Taliban in Afghanistan, which they view as evil regimes. Based on this, they conclude that the current Iranian regime must be eliminated in order for the Iranian people to achieve freedom and liberation.

This is not entirely accurate. Compared with standard democratic countries, Iran’s current regime—namely a dual system in which clerical and secular elements are integrated yet divided in their functions—is indeed relatively authoritarian and power-concentrated, but it is not entirely devoid of democracy. Iran’s president, members of parliament, and local administrative leaders (such as the mayor of Tehran) are all elected directly by the people, mostly through competitive elections with multiple candidates. Although candidates must be vetted and approved by clerical authorities, the elections are still conducted on a one-person-one-vote basis with multiple candidates, and relatively secular and reformist figures frequently defeat conservative candidates favored by the clerical establishment.

Former Iranian presidents such as Khatami, Rafsanjani, and Rouhani, as well as the current president Pezeshkian, are all reformists inclined toward secularism. Although the Iranian president more closely resembles a prime minister in countries with strong presidential systems—responsible for day-to-day administration and implementation—while the Supreme Leader (formerly Khomeini, now Khamenei) is the highest leader and ultimate policymaker, the Iranian president still wields significant administrative and diplomatic power. For example, during Rouhani’s tenure, efforts were made to promote market-oriented economic reforms, improve women’s rights, and improve relations with the United States and Europe. Of course, the Supreme Leader Khamenei also tacitly permitted these reforms, which itself indicates that even conservatives do not entirely reject certain enlightened changes.

By comparison, many monarchies in the Middle East—such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, and Bahrain—are either outright autocracies without democracy or possess constitutional elements yet remain minimally democratic at best. Countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Libya are ruled by military strongmen or fragmented warlord forces and likewise lack democracy. Clearly, Iran is in fact among the relatively more democratic countries in the Middle East and the Muslim world. Although it cannot be compared with highly democratic states and also falls short of Islamic democracies such as Turkey, it is evidently not a fully authoritarian system, let alone comparable to a country like North Korea, which can be said to have virtually zero democracy.

Moreover, in terms of domestic ethnic relations, counterterrorism, and treatment of ethnic minorities, Iran performs better than the vast majority of Islamic countries, and even better than most multiethnic countries elsewhere in the world. The majority ethnic group in Iran is Persian, alongside Azerbaijanis, Kurds, Arabs, and a very small Jewish minority. Relations among these groups are relatively harmonious, and none have suffered significant ethnic oppression (although religious authoritarian oppression does exist). Terrorist attacks are also rare. This is extremely rare and noteworthy when compared with the Middle East, where ethnic conflicts are severe and terrorist attacks frequent, as well as with other countries where either majorities oppress minorities or small groups dominate larger populations.

Second, many people believe that Iranian society has no freedom at all and that the social environment is extremely suffocating. This, too, is a generalization that exaggerates reality.

After the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution, religious authorities did indeed impose constraints on the population through Islamic law, particularly restricting women’s rights, freedoms, and even dress. However, due to a certain legacy of social openness from the Pahlavi era, as well as the longer-standing influence of a relatively enlightened Persian civilization, the reality in Iran is not one in which society is completely ruled by religious law as the clerical authorities might desire or as outsiders unfamiliar with the situation might imagine. Instead, there remains a considerable degree of freedom.

In the more than three decades since Khomeini’s death, religious and social policies have generally become more relaxed. While enforcement can sometimes be strict, more often local authorities “turn a blind eye.” Today, Iranian youth are highly “Westernized,” able to use platforms such as Google and YouTube with ease, and wear jeans and fashionable clothing. Owing to Iran’s Persian secular historical traditions, religious atmosphere is also less intense than in other Middle Eastern countries dominated by Arab populations. Under clerical rule and Sharia law, there exist many secular “unwritten rules” that help sustain social functioning. Of course, in concrete terms, urban middle classes enjoy greater freedom, while rural areas are more conservative. Even so, rural Iran is still incomparable to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.

In 2022, after Iranian woman Mahsa Amini was beaten to death by police for refusing to wear a headscarf, nationwide protests erupted. Not only opposition figures protested against clerical authorities, but even several members of Iran’s national football team—who are part of the establishment—openly expressed support. The national team also repeatedly refused to sing the Iranian national anthem during international matches to show solidarity with the protesters. Apart from a few individuals who were briefly detained, most supporters suffered no serious consequences. Such circumstances demonstrate that Iran retains a certain degree of freedom and space for dissent, rather than being a totalitarian system with absolutely no freedom of expression.

Although Iranian women do face certain restrictions, and some activists and feminists are persecuted, in terms of education, employment, social status, and daily life, they still enjoy a notable degree of freedom and dignity. Women make up more than 60 percent of students at Iranian universities, including the country’s top institution, the University of Tehran. Iran has also produced many female directors, actresses, scientists, and engineers. Examples include the prominent female roles and actresses in the Oscar-winning film A Separation, and Iranian woman Maryam Mirzakhani receiving the Fields Medal, the world’s highest honor in mathematics. In important sectors such as education, healthcare, and scientific research, women’s numbers and contributions are no less than those of men. This grants many Iranian women greater dignity and autonomy, without needing to depend on men. Of course, not only Iranian women but Iranian men as well have relatively high levels of education, also surpassing those in most Middle Eastern countries.

This certainly does not mean that Iranian women are free from constraints or repression, but it is far from the stereotypical image of women having no rights or freedoms and living like servants. Iranian women protest partly because they are oppressed, but also because they possess a stronger sense of dignity and autonomy, as well as space in which to resist. In more authoritarian countries with tighter control, women and various dissenters may not even have the possibility of organizing large-scale street protests, and women’s status is generally lower, with far less awareness, capacity, or conditions for resistance. In some economically developed Islamic countries, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, women may enjoy a fair amount of personal freedom in daily life, but female labor participation rates are low, independent living capacity is limited, and women’s status and autonomy are in fact inferior to those of Iranian women, who are broadly higher-educated and widely employed.

As for Iranian society as a whole, although freedom is indeed insufficient, it is not entirely absent, and in fact exceeds that of some other Middle Eastern countries and several authoritarian countries in the East. Although Iran’s religious authoritarianism is pronounced, compared with Sunni Islam, Shiite Islam in Iran has a stronger tendency toward reform and flexibility, and is more inclined to adapt to practical needs. It is therefore not as extreme or anti-human as stereotypes suggest. For example, Iran’s policies toward transgender individuals and toward ethnic and religious minorities are more enlightened than those of Sunni-dominated systems.

The author does not claim that Iran is highly democratic or highly free, nor that Shiism is particularly tolerant. It is clear that Iran lacks democracy and freedom, and Shiite clerical authoritarianism is certainly not inclusive. However, the degree to which a country is democratic or free should not be judged through simplistic binary thinking, but rather assessed based on facts to arrive at a balanced and appropriate conclusion.

Third, many people believe that Iran is a hegemonic power in the Middle East, an international rogue state that commits all kinds of evils, and that it even seeks to develop nuclear weapons. On this basis, they regard Iran as deeply evil and therefore deserving of attack and destruction.

In reality, however, over the past several decades Iran’s diplomatic and military behavior, compared with that of many other countries in the Middle East and the world, has not been notably in violation of international law or international norms. On the core issue at the center of diplomatic disputes—the Iranian nuclear issue—Iran did not violate the nuclear agreement it once reached with Western countries. After the 1979 revolution, because the Islamic regime opposed the United States while also refusing to align with the Soviet bloc, Eastern Europe, China, or India (as Khomeini put it: “Neither West nor East, only Islam”), and because it stood in opposition to Sunni forces that constitute the majority of the Muslim world, Iran became quite isolated internationally. This constrained its ability to project influence abroad and also forced it to be especially mindful of adhering to international rules, so as not to give hostile countries such as the United States and Israel an excuse to attack it. During the Khomeini era there was once talk of “exporting the revolution,” but this in effect soon ceased amid severe internal and external pressures.

Objectively, this has instead made Iran more self-restrained rather than a bully toward others. In the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War, Iran was the victim of aggression and the defensive side. Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, by contrast, was supported at the time by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and others in its invasion of Iran. In 1988, the U.S. military shot down an Iranian civilian airliner, killing 290 people (including 252 Iranian nationals), but because of Iran’s isolated position, the incident was never properly resolved. During the chaotic situation in Afghanistan in the 1990s, compared with Saudi Arabia and other countries that aggressively exported Wahhabi extremism, and Pakistan, which fostered the Taliban, Iran was relatively restrained—even after Iranian diplomats were massacred by the Taliban—and did not forcefully interfere in the internal affairs of this weaker neighboring country.

Some people compare attacks on Iran to the Allied campaign against Nazi Germany and Japan in World War II. This is clearly a false analogy. Over the past several decades, Iran has not launched wars of aggression against other countries, nor has it committed atrocities such as massacring millions of unarmed people of other ethnicities, or invading other countries and killing tens of millions of their soldiers and civilians. As for the threatening rhetoric by Iran’s theocratic rulers toward Israel, such as calls to “destroy Israel,” these have remained at the level of words and have not been put into practice. By contrast, it is Israel that has assassinated numerous Iranian scientists and military personnel.

As for the so-called “Shiite Crescent” formed by Iran together with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Alawite forces in Syria, pro-Iranian factions in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen, this bloc is a defensive alliance of weaker and minority forces, formed in response to Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Israel. Although the establishment and activities of the “Shiite Crescent” have indeed exacerbated instability in the Middle East, if the actions of all parties in the region and beyond are viewed in an even-handed manner, Iran’s and Shiite forces’ efforts at self-preservation and counteraction are understandable and should not be singled out for unilateral condemnation.

As for the Iranian nuclear issue, anyone who examines the negotiations between the United States and Iran prior to the Trump administration, as well as the relevant engagements by other Western countries and the United Nations, along with related media reports and analyses, can see that Iran had long agreed in negotiations to abandon the development of nuclear weapons and subsequently fulfilled this commitment, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. However, after Trump took office in 2017, he tore up the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, showing complete contempt for contractual commitments. This move also dealt a blow to Iran’s reformists, who favored peace and closer ties with the West, while empowering hardliners. The negotiation process over the nuclear agreement itself demonstrates that Iran was reasonable and acted in good faith. This stands in stark contrast to another nuclear-armed country, North Korea, which refused to honor its commitments under the Six-Party Talks, repeatedly conducted nuclear tests, and engaged in blackmail against all sides.

Fourth, many people believe that attacks on Iran by Israel and the United States can eliminate Iran’s clerical authoritarian forces, promote freedom and democracy in Iran, liberate the Iranian people, and free women from constraints.

This is in fact a case of Chinese liberals and Chinese-language internet users forcibly projecting some of their own perceptions and ambitions regarding China-related issues onto the Iranian issue, in order to vent their own emotions and demands, while disregarding the facts themselves.

The Netanyahu government in Israel and the Trump administration in the United States are both forces that strongly prioritize their own country and their own nation, place their own national interests above all else, are willing to harm the rights and even the lives of people in other countries, and do not hesitate to undermine international law. From their words, deeds, and the values they display, it is clear that they do not genuinely care about human rights, freedom, or democracy in Iran. Indeed, Netanyahu, Trump, and their supporters themselves are quite hostile to feminism, pluralistic democracy, and checks and balances of power, and they practice authoritarianism and suppress dissent at home.

When they speak of Iran’s authoritarian and corrupt regime and its oppression of the people, this is merely a pretext for attacking Iran and a means of sowing division among Iranians. They have not formulated any concrete or feasible plan to bring about regime change in Iran or a transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Nor have they shown respect or care for the Iranian state and people outside the regime. Instead, they simply hope to strike and weaken this hostile country, push it into deeper poverty and internal chaos, and do so at the cost of harming Iranian civilians and undermining Iran’s national interests and Persian national dignity. Although attacks and sanctions by Israel and the Trump administration have indeed, in objective terms, dealt blows to Iran’s clerical ruling group, the greater victims have been the Iranian state and people. Moreover, the clerical establishment can always select new figures to replace those eliminated; while their capabilities may be inferior to their predecessors, their rigidity and conservatism may well be even more severe than those who were “decapitated.”

Long-term sanctions and attacks on Iran by the United States and Israel have also produced the side effect of obstructing human rights progress, by giving Iran’s domestic hardliners both justification and momentum to close the country off from the outside world and intensify internal repression. Iran has elected several reformist presidents, such as Rouhani and Pezeshkian, all of whom clearly expressed a desire to improve relations with the United States and the West. Rouhani even conveyed a non-hostile attitude toward Israel, such as no longer denying the historical reality of the Holocaust and refraining from claims of destroying Israel. Iran is among the countries most suitable for “peaceful evolution.” Yet it was precisely Trump’s two terms in office, and the dominance of Republican hawks over foreign and military policy, that destroyed the possibility of promoting further Iranian openness and reform through peaceful and rational means, allowing conservatives to gain the upper hand and providing them with excuses to pursue rigidly conservative policies.

The economic stagnation, material shortages, popular impoverishment, and loss of national and civic dignity caused by sanctions, blockades, and military strikes imposed by the United States, Israel, and other countries hostile to Iran have also intensified internal contradictions and conflicts within Iran. Different groups and individuals inside Iran have become more prone to harming one another, and the ruling clerical forces have inflicted even harsher damage on the populace than when the external diplomatic environment was more favorable. The Iranian people thus suffer from a dual oppression: internal clerical authoritarianism and external imperial hegemony. They have not obtained freedom, democracy, or liberation, but instead have become poorer and more distressed.

Many Iranian opposition figures themselves have recognized these realities and, amid Israel’s recent large-scale attacks on Iran, have spoken out clearly against attacks by Israel and the Trump administration. For example, Iranian feminist activist Narges Mohammadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023; the long-imprisoned Iranian reformist politician Mostafa Tajzadeh; and Iranian scholar Sadegh Zibakalam, who has been imprisoned multiple times for opposing the government, have all explicitly opposed Israel’s attacks on Iran and argued that Israeli attacks and proposed U.S. participation in attacking Iran cannot bring freedom, liberation, or democracy to Iran. Only a small number of opposition figures, such as Reza Pahlavi, the son of the penultimate shah, support Israel’s attacks on Iran; the majority oppose them.

Of course, figures such as Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi have also criticized the performance of Iran’s theocratic regime during this Israel–Iran conflict, but their criticism targets the regime’s failure to protect the people and its allowing external enemies to exploit vulnerabilities. As Mohammadi stated, “For forty-six years, you have beaten the drums of war but built no shelters for the people, treating them as tools of propaganda. This must be overthrown.” They are not calling for the regime to surrender to Israel or the United States.

Iran certainly needs democracy, but not through the unreasonable methods employed by Israel and the Trump administration, such as tearing up the nuclear agreement without cause, launching violent attacks, or imposing comprehensive sanctions under a strategy of “maximum pressure.” Rather, there should be both pressure and engagement, linking sanctions to economic and trade relations as well as to human rights, supporting Iran’s progressive forces in initiating change, respecting the autonomy of the Iranian people, and gradually facilitating transformation.

Moreover, regardless of motivation, Israel’s attacks on Iran, as well as actions such as the Trump administration’s assassination of Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani, are all violations of international law, lack legitimate justification, seriously undermine international peace and the sovereignty of other countries, and are detrimental to humanitarian principles and human rights. If merely “feeling threatened” were sufficient justification to attack another country, then by the same logic Russia’s Putin regime attacking Ukraine would also become “legitimate.” If one supports Ukraine in opposing Russia while simultaneously supporting Israel’s attacks on Iran, this is clearly a double standard and forfeits moral credibility. Once such a precedent is set, more countries will claim the same justification to attack neighboring states or hostile countries, plunging the world into even greater warfare and chaos.

Fifth, quite a few Chinese opposition figures believe that Iran, together with China and Russia, forms an “evil axis” jointly confronting the West, and they further believe that Israel and the United States striking Iran can also strike and deter China and Russia. This misconception is even more detached from facts and farther from the truth than the previous ones.

Whether historically or today, Iran and China and Russia have never been especially close. Only in recent years, out of a shared need to counter the West, have they developed a loose cooperative relationship. The so-called “China–Russia–Iran iron triangle” is merely a far-fetched invention by some CCP online propagandists, some opposition figures, and various people with their own stances who do not understand the realities. For many years, Iran has faced attacks and sanctions from the United States and Israel, yet China and Russia have not provided Iran with any substantial or forceful support. At most, they import Iranian oil and occasionally conduct joint military exercises, but they have never directly provided military assistance or protection. Moreover, Iran often shows an inclination to cooperate with Europe, for example in oil development and infrastructure construction, and this is precisely one reason why China and Russia feel displeased with Iran. In addition, Iran has more actual democracy than China (see the first section of controversies), which is also an important reason why the CCP and Iran are not close, and why supporters of the Chinese government feel antipathy toward Iran.

After Israel attacked Iran in this round, China and Russia, beyond verbal condemnation of Israel and nominal support for Iran, have taken no substantive actions in political, military, or economic terms. Supporters of the Chinese government (the so-called “fifty-centers” and “little pinks”) have even mocked Iran’s weakness, mocked Iran for electing a reformist president friendly toward the West, and mocked Iran’s desire to improve relations with the West.

Even if Iran’s current regime were to collapse, it would not shake the CCP’s rule in China or Putin’s rule in Russia, just as the collapse of Saddam in Iraq and Gaddafi in Libya did not affect the CCP and China, or Putin and Russia. Although the collapse of Iran’s current regime would to some extent affect China’s influence in the Middle East, that impact would also be limited. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Qatar are even more important partners for China than Iran is, and they are also more stable and reliable, aligning with China’s pragmatic, economy-first, stability-first diplomatic stance. Moreover, if Iran’s current regime were overthrown and a new government emerged, Iran’s economic and trade cooperation with China would not necessarily decrease and might even increase (as seen after Saddam’s fall, when China entered Iraq’s oil market on a large scale once sanctions were lifted). And even if China’s influence in the Middle East were weakened, what would be harmed would only be China’s international competitiveness; it would not bring about freedom and democracy in China.

Furthermore, U.S. assistance to Israel in striking Iran does not mean the United States would similarly strike China and Russia. Trump striking Iran while continuing to be friendly toward Putin and Russia, and refusing to actively support Ukraine, is an example. And in China policy and the Taiwan issue, Trump would not treat the CCP’s China the way he treats Iran. China and Russia are both far stronger than Iran; their military strength, economic scale, and international influence are not comparable to Iran’s. They also have greater cooperative value for the United States and for the Trump administration. Trump also bullies the weak and fears the strong, so of course he would not treat China and Russia the same way—let alone launch military attacks on them.

Trump also admires strongman leaders such as Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, who put pragmatism above all else. He is unwilling even to attack and overthrow North Korea, let alone countries like China and Russia that are stronger and whose leaders suit his preferences even more. Trump and his aides attacking Iran instead reveals the ugly nature of “picking targets based on who they are” and striking especially hard at countries and forces that still seek reason, retain some ideals (even if they are irrational religious zeal), and carry some democratic color, while choosing to let truly evil dictators go free.

The above misconceptions and the author’s rebuttals are only part of the controversies involving Iran-related issues, and they are relatively brief analyses. Due to space constraints, the author will stop here. All of the above can also be verified through various channels, such as checking relevant reporting and investigation data.

The serious misconceptions that some Chinese people and Chinese-language users hold regarding Iran largely stem from forcibly projecting certain China-related frames onto the Iran issue, and then defining it through simplistic and unrealistic binaries such as “democracy versus authoritarianism” and “civilization destroying barbarism,” while making emotional and extreme comments that disregard the complexity of facts and the many-sided nature of the problems. This leads to distorted understanding of many basic facts about Iran, erroneous judgments, confused logic, and mistaken positions. (Moreover, China-related issues—especially China’s foreign-related issues—also cannot be reduced to a simple “democracy versus authoritarianism” or “civilization versus barbarism” dichotomy. One should not assume that U.S., European, or Japanese toughness toward China is goodwill, or that striking China will promote democracy. Issues of freedom and democracy are one matter, while issues of national and ethnic interests are another. Democratic countries are not necessarily kind or peaceful. On the contrary, because they may possess greater legitimacy and popular support, they can be even more aggressive than authoritarian states that prioritize internal stability. Europe and the United States may have somewhat more humanitarian sentiment, yet still place their own interests at the core. Japan and Israel are economically developed and provide good protections for their own citizens’ rights, but that does not mean they are benevolent toward foreigners; on the contrary, they often, for the sake of their own national and ethnic interests—many of which are unjust interests—commit more infringements against other countries and bully people of other ethnicities more.)

If one insists on pointing to similarities between China and Iran, there indeed are some: both countries occupy a marginal, relatively isolated position internationally; both face intense internal social contradictions; and external enemies, under the pretext of criticizing the regimes of China and Iran, are in fact harming the legitimate national and ethnic interests of both countries. The states and peoples of China and Iran suffer undeserved stigmatization and unfair treatment.

Because Iran has long been hostile to the West—especially the United States—and is also separated from and opposed to Sunni Islam, in a context where Western-led global public opinion and Sunni-led Muslim-world public opinion dominate, and because Iran is indeed authoritarian and has human-rights abuses, many negative aspects of Iran are amplified internationally while positive realities are ignored by mainstream discourse. This generates strong stereotypes among those with limited knowledge of Iran’s national conditions; what they know are partial facts. Many Chinese people, including liberals and opposition figures, both feel close to the West and lack sufficient information channels, and they also simplistically equate Iran with China. As a result, their aversion toward Iran becomes even stronger than that of others, they ignore complex realities, and they repeatedly make erroneous evaluations of Iran-related issues.

The author has no interest ties with Iran and obviously has no need to “whitewash” Iran. The reason the author seeks to clarify these issues is that sincere intellectuals and international observers, when faced with a chorus of uniform voices and a “one-sided” public opinion climate, should all the more pursue truth from facts, uphold objectivity, and promote balance—rather than embellish, follow the crowd, and add fuel to the fire. Moreover, whether in China’s domestic affairs, other countries’ affairs, or international issues, speaking up somewhat more for the weaker yet more reasonable side on the basis of facts, and applying more scrutiny and critique to the stronger yet unreasonable side, is precisely the stance and code of conduct that intellectuals, media workers, and people of conscience ought to uphold.

The author also hopes that people in China and around the world, regardless of their positions, should express their views and emotions on the premise of acknowledging basic facts, following logic, and offering reasoned arguments and evidence. Mistaken understandings, assumptions taken for granted, and wishful expectations will not bring about just and good outcomes.

( On the morning of September 28, 2023, I (Wang Qingmin (王庆民), a Chinese writer living in Europe) went to the Embassy of Iran in Germany. After taking a number and waiting in line, I handed my letter addressed to Iranian human rights protesters and those in power to a member of the Iranian staff.

I told the embassy staff that I hold rather friendly feelings toward Iran and do not wish to see the Iranian people killing one another. I hope that the Iranian government will end repression, achieve reconciliation and peace, protect human rights and improve people’s livelihoods domestically, and resist bullying by great powers externally, so that the Persian nation may be reshaped and reborn.

I have long felt sympathy and understanding toward Iran, especially toward the Persian nation. This is because its history, destiny, and present circumstances are similar to those of the Han Chinese in China. The Persian nation has a glorious history; later it was invaded by Islamic forces, converted to Shiism, and has long been besieged by Sunnis. After the 1979 Revolution, it has faced attacks and sanctions from various forces such as the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel.

Although Iran does indeed have serious human rights problems, this is not a justification for outsiders to bully it at will, and such attacks cannot improve Iran’s human rights situation.
The past several years, I have written many articles commenting on Iranian issues, and the year before last I also went to the Iranian embassy to deliver letters. My writings include A Century of Historical Change in Iran and the Turbulent Fate of Women（《伊朗百年历史变迁与女性命运的跌宕》）, Ode to Iranian Women (a poem)（《伊朗妇女颂》）, Iran amid Domestic Protests and External Attack Risks: Rethinking International Intervention（《伊朗内外交困与外部干预的复杂性》）, Several Controversies and Misconceptions in Chinese Public Opinion on the Iran Issue（《中文舆论对伊朗问题的若干争议和误区》）, Saudi–Iran Rapprochement: A Marriage of Convenience under Long-Term Rivalry（《沙特伊朗复交：两国长期争霸下的权宜之计》）, The Background of Israel’s Large-Scale Attacks on Iran and the Disappearance of Compromise and Peace in the Middle East（《以色列大举袭击伊朗的背景与中东妥协和平的消失》）, The 2024 Iranian Presidential Election: A Dull Contest between Conservatives and Reformists amid Internal and External Crises（《2024年伊朗总统选举：内忧外患下保守派与改革派的沉闷竞争》）, as well as this letter addressed to Iran’s rulers, opposition forces, and all sectors of society.

Regarding the protests in Iran in December 2025, I support the Iranian people in their pursuit of freedom, democracy, and improved livelihoods, while also opposing bullying and sanctions against Iran by the U.S. Republican Party and Israel. The international community should treat Iran and its people with sincerity and respect, and should distinguish dictators from the country and its people. It is even more necessary to oppose the United States and Israel exploiting the banner of freedom and democracy to take advantage of turmoil and practice hegemonism.)

",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1q9kkls/chineselanguage_opinion_on_iran/,"Chinese-Language Opinion on Iran: Misconceptions—Stereotypes Undervalue Reality; Iran Under Clerical Rule Still Has Some Democracy and Achievements; U.S./Israeli Intervention Exploits Crisis. Iran Needs More Democracy and Human Rights—Judge Facts Objectively 4 Recently, Israel has launched large-scale attacks on Iran, Iran has retaliated, and the United States has also directly intervened, causing the situation to deteriorate rapidly. This has drawn global attention to Iran, and China and the Chinese-language public sphere are no exception. Within Chinese-language discourse, debates over the Israel–Iran conflict and Iran-related issues have been particularly intense. Different groups, to varying degrees, project many Iranian events and figures onto China-related issues, interpreting and commenting on them through their own positions and value systems, based on their respective perceptions and imaginations.

However, these commentaries are often highly subjective and shaped by preconceived notions. They frequently involve misperceptions of Iran and the Israel–Iran conflict, neglect or exaggeration of facts, and distortions of right and wrong, resulting in various misunderstandings and misconceptions. Here, the author seeks to enumerate some of these misunderstandings and to clarify the issues and facts involved.

First, many people simply regard Iran as an authoritarian and totalitarian state, believing that its regime or ruling group is dictatorial, commits all manner of evils, and stands in complete opposition to its people. They equate it with regimes such as North Korea’s Kim family rule or the Taliban in Afghanistan, which they view as evil regimes. Based on this, they conclude that the current Iranian regime must be eliminated in order for the Iranian people to achieve freedom and liberation.

This is not entirely accurate. Compared with standard democratic countries, Iran’s current regime—namely a dual system in which clerical and secular elements are integrated yet divided in their functions—is indeed relatively authoritarian and power-concentrated, but it is not entirely devoid of democracy. Iran’s president, members of parliament, and local administrative leaders (such as the mayor of Tehran) are all elected directly by the people, mostly through competitive elections with multiple candidates. Although candidates must be vetted and approved by clerical authorities, the elections are still conducted on a one-person-one-vote basis with multiple candidates, and relatively secular and reformist figures frequently defeat conservative candidates favored by the clerical establishment.

Former Iranian presidents such as Khatami, Rafsanjani, and Rouhani, as well as the current president Pezeshkian, are all reformists inclined toward secularism. Although the Iranian president more closely resembles a prime minister in countries with strong presidential systems—responsible for day-to-day administration and implementation—while the Supreme Leader (formerly Khomeini, now Khamenei) is the highest leader and ultimate policymaker, the Iranian president still wields significant administrative and diplomatic power. For example, during Rouhani’s tenure, efforts were made to promote market-oriented economic reforms, improve women’s rights, and improve relations with the United States and Europe. Of course, the Supreme Leader Khamenei also tacitly permitted these reforms, which itself indicates that even conservatives do not entirely reject certain enlightened changes.

By comparison, many monarchies in the Middle East—such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, and Bahrain—are either outright autocracies without democracy or possess constitutional elements yet remain minimally democratic at best. Countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Libya are ruled by military strongmen or fragmented warlord forces and likewise lack democracy. Clearly, Iran is in fact among the relatively more democratic countries in the Middle East and the Muslim world. Although it cannot be compared with highly democratic states and also falls short of Islamic democracies such as Turkey, it is evidently not a fully authoritarian system, let alone comparable to a country like North Korea, which can be said to have virtually zero democracy.

Moreover, in terms of domestic ethnic relations, counterterrorism, and treatment of ethnic minorities, Iran performs better than the vast majority of Islamic countries, and even better than most multiethnic countries elsewhere in the world. The majority ethnic group in Iran is Persian, alongside Azerbaijanis, Kurds, Arabs, and a very small Jewish minority. Relations among these groups are relatively harmonious, and none have suffered significant ethnic oppression (although religious authoritarian oppression does exist). Terrorist attacks are also rare. This is extremely rare and noteworthy when compared with the Middle East, where ethnic conflicts are severe and terrorist attacks frequent, as well as with other countries where either majorities oppress minorities or small groups dominate larger populations.

Second, many people believe that Iranian society has no freedom at all and that the social environment is extremely suffocating. This, too, is a generalization that exaggerates reality.

After the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution, religious authorities did indeed impose constraints on the population through Islamic law, particularly restricting women’s rights, freedoms, and even dress. However, due to a certain legacy of social openness from the Pahlavi era, as well as the longer-standing influence of a relatively enlightened Persian civilization, the reality in Iran is not one in which society is completely ruled by religious law as the clerical authorities might desire or as outsiders unfamiliar with the situation might imagine. Instead, there remains a considerable degree of freedom.

In the more than three decades since Khomeini’s death, religious and social policies have generally become more relaxed. While enforcement can sometimes be strict, more often local authorities “turn a blind eye.” Today, Iranian youth are highly “Westernized,” able to use platforms such as Google and YouTube with ease, and wear jeans and fashionable clothing. Owing to Iran’s Persian secular historical traditions, religious atmosphere is also less intense than in other Middle Eastern countries dominated by Arab populations. Under clerical rule and Sharia law, there exist many secular “unwritten rules” that help sustain social functioning. Of course, in concrete terms, urban middle classes enjoy greater freedom, while rural areas are more conservative. Even so, rural Iran is still incomparable to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.

In 2022, after Iranian woman Mahsa Amini was beaten to death by police for refusing to wear a headscarf, nationwide protests erupted. Not only opposition figures protested against clerical authorities, but even several members of Iran’s national football team—who are part of the establishment—openly expressed support. The national team also repeatedly refused to sing the Iranian national anthem during international matches to show solidarity with the protesters. Apart from a few individuals who were briefly detained, most supporters suffered no serious consequences. Such circumstances demonstrate that Iran retains a certain degree of freedom and space for dissent, rather than being a totalitarian system with absolutely no freedom of expression.

Although Iranian women do face certain restrictions, and some activists and feminists are persecuted, in terms of education, employment, social status, and daily life, they still enjoy a notable degree of freedom and dignity. Women make up more than 60 percent of students at Iranian universities, including the country’s top institution, the University of Tehran. Iran has also produced many female directors, actresses, scientists, and engineers. Examples include the prominent female roles and actresses in the Oscar-winning film A Separation, and Iranian woman Maryam Mirzakhani receiving the Fields Medal, the world’s highest honor in mathematics. In important sectors such as education, healthcare, and scientific research, women’s numbers and contributions are no less than those of men. This grants many Iranian women greater dignity and autonomy, without needing to depend on men. Of course, not only Iranian women but Iranian men as well have relatively high levels of education, also surpassing those in most Middle Eastern countries.

This certainly does not mean that Iranian women are free from constraints or repression, but it is far from the stereotypical image of women having no rights or freedoms and living like servants. Iranian women protest partly because they are oppressed, but also because they possess a stronger sense of dignity and autonomy, as well as space in which to resist. In more authoritarian countries with tighter control, women and various dissenters may not even have the possibility of organizing large-scale street protests, and women’s status is generally lower, with far less awareness, capacity, or conditions for resistance. In some economically developed Islamic countries, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, women may enjoy a fair amount of personal freedom in daily life, but female labor participation rates are low, independent living capacity is limited, and women’s status and autonomy are in fact inferior to those of Iranian women, who are broadly higher-educated and widely employed.

As for Iranian society as a whole, although freedom is indeed insufficient, it is not entirely absent, and in fact exceeds that of some other Middle Eastern countries and several authoritarian countries in the East. Although Iran’s religious authoritarianism is pronounced, compared with Sunni Islam, Shiite Islam in Iran has a stronger tendency toward reform and flexibility, and is more inclined to adapt to practical needs. It is therefore not as extreme or anti-human as stereotypes suggest. For example, Iran’s policies toward transgender individuals and toward ethnic and religious minorities are more enlightened than those of Sunni-dominated systems.

The author does not claim that Iran is highly democratic or highly free, nor that Shiism is particularly tolerant. It is clear that Iran lacks democracy and freedom, and Shiite clerical authoritarianism is certainly not inclusive. However, the degree to which a country is democratic or free should not be judged through simplistic binary thinking, but rather assessed based on facts to arrive at a balanced and appropriate conclusion.

Third, many people believe that Iran is a hegemonic power in the Middle East, an international rogue state that commits all kinds of evils, and that it even seeks to develop nuclear weapons. On this basis, they regard Iran as deeply evil and therefore deserving of attack and destruction.

In reality, however, over the past several decades Iran’s diplomatic and military behavior, compared with that of many other countries in the Middle East and the world, has not been notably in violation of international law or international norms. On the core issue at the center of diplomatic disputes—the Iranian nuclear issue—Iran did not violate the nuclear agreement it once reached with Western countries. After the 1979 revolution, because the Islamic regime opposed the United States while also refusing to align with the Soviet bloc, Eastern Europe, China, or India (as Khomeini put it: “Neither West nor East, only Islam”), and because it stood in opposition to Sunni forces that constitute the majority of the Muslim world, Iran became quite isolated internationally. This constrained its ability to project influence abroad and also forced it to be especially mindful of adhering to international rules, so as not to give hostile countries such as the United States and Israel an excuse to attack it. During the Khomeini era there was once talk of “exporting the revolution,” but this in effect soon ceased amid severe internal and external pressures.

Objectively, this has instead made Iran more self-restrained rather than a bully toward others. In the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War, Iran was the victim of aggression and the defensive side. Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, by contrast, was supported at the time by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and others in its invasion of Iran. In 1988, the U.S. military shot down an Iranian civilian airliner, killing 290 people (including 252 Iranian nationals), but because of Iran’s isolated position, the incident was never properly resolved. During the chaotic situation in Afghanistan in the 1990s, compared with Saudi Arabia and other countries that aggressively exported Wahhabi extremism, and Pakistan, which fostered the Taliban, Iran was relatively restrained—even after Iranian diplomats were massacred by the Taliban—and did not forcefully interfere in the internal affairs of this weaker neighboring country.

Some people compare attacks on Iran to the Allied campaign against Nazi Germany and Japan in World War II. This is clearly a false analogy. Over the past several decades, Iran has not launched wars of aggression against other countries, nor has it committed atrocities such as massacring millions of unarmed people of other ethnicities, or invading other countries and killing tens of millions of their soldiers and civilians. As for the threatening rhetoric by Iran’s theocratic rulers toward Israel, such as calls to “destroy Israel,” these have remained at the level of words and have not been put into practice. By contrast, it is Israel that has assassinated numerous Iranian scientists and military personnel.

As for the so-called “Shiite Crescent” formed by Iran together with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Alawite forces in Syria, pro-Iranian factions in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen, this bloc is a defensive alliance of weaker and minority forces, formed in response to Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Israel. Although the establishment and activities of the “Shiite Crescent” have indeed exacerbated instability in the Middle East, if the actions of all parties in the region and beyond are viewed in an even-handed manner, Iran’s and Shiite forces’ efforts at self-preservation and counteraction are understandable and should not be singled out for unilateral condemnation.

As for the Iranian nuclear issue, anyone who examines the negotiations between the United States and Iran prior to the Trump administration, as well as the relevant engagements by other Western countries and the United Nations, along with related media reports and analyses, can see that Iran had long agreed in negotiations to abandon the development of nuclear weapons and subsequently fulfilled this commitment, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. However, after Trump took office in 2017, he tore up the Iran nuclear agreement in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, showing complete contempt for contractual commitments. This move also dealt a blow to Iran’s reformists, who favored peace and closer ties with the West, while empowering hardliners. The negotiation process over the nuclear agreement itself demonstrates that Iran was reasonable and acted in good faith. This stands in stark contrast to another nuclear-armed country, North Korea, which refused to honor its commitments under the Six-Party Talks, repeatedly conducted nuclear tests, and engaged in blackmail against all sides.

Fourth, many people believe that attacks on Iran by Israel and the United States can eliminate Iran’s clerical authoritarian forces, promote freedom and democracy in Iran, liberate the Iranian people, and free women from constraints.

This is in fact a case of Chinese liberals and Chinese-language internet users forcibly projecting some of their own perceptions and ambitions regarding China-related issues onto the Iranian issue, in order to vent their own emotions and demands, while disregarding the facts themselves.

The Netanyahu government in Israel and the Trump administration in the United States are both forces that strongly prioritize their own country and their own nation, place their own national interests above all else, are willing to harm the rights and even the lives of people in other countries, and do not hesitate to undermine international law. From their words, deeds, and the values they display, it is clear that they do not genuinely care about human rights, freedom, or democracy in Iran. Indeed, Netanyahu, Trump, and their supporters themselves are quite hostile to feminism, pluralistic democracy, and checks and balances of power, and they practice authoritarianism and suppress dissent at home.

When they speak of Iran’s authoritarian and corrupt regime and its oppression of the people, this is merely a pretext for attacking Iran and a means of sowing division among Iranians. They have not formulated any concrete or feasible plan to bring about regime change in Iran or a transition from authoritarianism to democracy. Nor have they shown respect or care for the Iranian state and people outside the regime. Instead, they simply hope to strike and weaken this hostile country, push it into deeper poverty and internal chaos, and do so at the cost of harming Iranian civilians and undermining Iran’s national interests and Persian national dignity. Although attacks and sanctions by Israel and the Trump administration have indeed, in objective terms, dealt blows to Iran’s clerical ruling group, the greater victims have been the Iranian state and people. Moreover, the clerical establishment can always select new figures to replace those eliminated; while their capabilities may be inferior to their predecessors, their rigidity and conservatism may well be even more severe than those who were “decapitated.”

Long-term sanctions and attacks on Iran by the United States and Israel have also produced the side effect of obstructing human rights progress, by giving Iran’s domestic hardliners both justification and momentum to close the country off from the outside world and intensify internal repression. Iran has elected several reformist presidents, such as Rouhani and Pezeshkian, all of whom clearly expressed a desire to improve relations with the United States and the West. Rouhani even conveyed a non-hostile attitude toward Israel, such as no longer denying the historical reality of the Holocaust and refraining from claims of destroying Israel. Iran is among the countries most suitable for “peaceful evolution.” Yet it was precisely Trump’s two terms in office, and the dominance of Republican hawks over foreign and military policy, that destroyed the possibility of promoting further Iranian openness and reform through peaceful and rational means, allowing conservatives to gain the upper hand and providing them with excuses to pursue rigidly conservative policies.

The economic stagnation, material shortages, popular impoverishment, and loss of national and civic dignity caused by sanctions, blockades, and military strikes imposed by the United States, Israel, and other countries hostile to Iran have also intensified internal contradictions and conflicts within Iran. Different groups and individuals inside Iran have become more prone to harming one another, and the ruling clerical forces have inflicted even harsher damage on the populace than when the external diplomatic environment was more favorable. The Iranian people thus suffer from a dual oppression: internal clerical authoritarianism and external imperial hegemony. They have not obtained freedom, democracy, or liberation, but instead have become poorer and more distressed.

Many Iranian opposition figures themselves have recognized these realities and, amid Israel’s recent large-scale attacks on Iran, have spoken out clearly against attacks by Israel and the Trump administration. For example, Iranian feminist activist Narges Mohammadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023; the long-imprisoned Iranian reformist politician Mostafa Tajzadeh; and Iranian scholar Sadegh Zibakalam, who has been imprisoned multiple times for opposing the government, have all explicitly opposed Israel’s attacks on Iran and argued that Israeli attacks and proposed U.S. participation in attacking Iran cannot bring freedom, liberation, or democracy to Iran. Only a small number of opposition figures, such as Reza Pahlavi, the son of the penultimate shah, support Israel’s attacks on Iran; the majority oppose them.

Of course, figures such as Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi have also criticized the performance of Iran’s theocratic regime during this Israel–Iran conflict, but their criticism targets the regime’s failure to protect the people and its allowing external enemies to exploit vulnerabilities. As Mohammadi stated, “For forty-six years, you have beaten the drums of war but built no shelters for the people, treating them as tools of propaganda. This must be overthrown.” They are not calling for the regime to surrender to Israel or the United States.

Iran certainly needs democracy, but not through the unreasonable methods employed by Israel and the Trump administration, such as tearing up the nuclear agreement without cause, launching violent attacks, or imposing comprehensive sanctions under a strategy of “maximum pressure.” Rather, there should be both pressure and engagement, linking sanctions to economic and trade relations as well as to human rights, supporting Iran’s progressive forces in initiating change, respecting the autonomy of the Iranian people, and gradually facilitating transformation.

Moreover, regardless of motivation, Israel’s attacks on Iran, as well as actions such as the Trump administration’s assassination of Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani, are all violations of international law, lack legitimate justification, seriously undermine international peace and the sovereignty of other countries, and are detrimental to humanitarian principles and human rights. If merely “feeling threatened” were sufficient justification to attack another country, then by the same logic Russia’s Putin regime attacking Ukraine would also become “legitimate.” If one supports Ukraine in opposing Russia while simultaneously supporting Israel’s attacks on Iran, this is clearly a double standard and forfeits moral credibility. Once such a precedent is set, more countries will claim the same justification to attack neighboring states or hostile countries, plunging the world into even greater warfare and chaos.

Fifth, quite a few Chinese opposition figures believe that Iran, together with China and Russia, forms an “evil axis” jointly confronting the West, and they further believe that Israel and the United States striking Iran can also strike and deter China and Russia. This misconception is even more detached from facts and farther from the truth than the previous ones.

Whether historically or today, Iran and China and Russia have never been especially close. Only in recent years, out of a shared need to counter the West, have they developed a loose cooperative relationship. The so-called “China–Russia–Iran iron triangle” is merely a far-fetched invention by some CCP online propagandists, some opposition figures, and various people with their own stances who do not understand the realities. For many years, Iran has faced attacks and sanctions from the United States and Israel, yet China and Russia have not provided Iran with any substantial or forceful support. At most, they import Iranian oil and occasionally conduct joint military exercises, but they have never directly provided military assistance or protection. Moreover, Iran often shows an inclination to cooperate with Europe, for example in oil development and infrastructure construction, and this is precisely one reason why China and Russia feel displeased with Iran. In addition, Iran has more actual democracy than China (see the first section of controversies), which is also an important reason why the CCP and Iran are not close, and why supporters of the Chinese government feel antipathy toward Iran.

After Israel attacked Iran in this round, China and Russia, beyond verbal condemnation of Israel and nominal support for Iran, have taken no substantive actions in political, military, or economic terms. Supporters of the Chinese government (the so-called “fifty-centers” and “little pinks”) have even mocked Iran’s weakness, mocked Iran for electing a reformist president friendly toward the West, and mocked Iran’s desire to improve relations with the West.

Even if Iran’s current regime were to collapse, it would not shake the CCP’s rule in China or Putin’s rule in Russia, just as the collapse of Saddam in Iraq and Gaddafi in Libya did not affect the CCP and China, or Putin and Russia. Although the collapse of Iran’s current regime would to some extent affect China’s influence in the Middle East, that impact would also be limited. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Qatar are even more important partners for China than Iran is, and they are also more stable and reliable, aligning with China’s pragmatic, economy-first, stability-first diplomatic stance. Moreover, if Iran’s current regime were overthrown and a new government emerged, Iran’s economic and trade cooperation with China would not necessarily decrease and might even increase (as seen after Saddam’s fall, when China entered Iraq’s oil market on a large scale once sanctions were lifted). And even if China’s influence in the Middle East were weakened, what would be harmed would only be China’s international competitiveness; it would not bring about freedom and democracy in China.

Furthermore, U.S. assistance to Israel in striking Iran does not mean the United States would similarly strike China and Russia. Trump striking Iran while continuing to be friendly toward Putin and Russia, and refusing to actively support Ukraine, is an example. And in China policy and the Taiwan issue, Trump would not treat the CCP’s China the way he treats Iran. China and Russia are both far stronger than Iran; their military strength, economic scale, and international influence are not comparable to Iran’s. They also have greater cooperative value for the United States and for the Trump administration. Trump also bullies the weak and fears the strong, so of course he would not treat China and Russia the same way—let alone launch military attacks on them.

Trump also admires strongman leaders such as Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, who put pragmatism above all else. He is unwilling even to attack and overthrow North Korea, let alone countries like China and Russia that are stronger and whose leaders suit his preferences even more. Trump and his aides attacking Iran instead reveals the ugly nature of “picking targets based on who they are” and striking especially hard at countries and forces that still seek reason, retain some ideals (even if they are irrational religious zeal), and carry some democratic color, while choosing to let truly evil dictators go free.

The above misconceptions and the author’s rebuttals are only part of the controversies involving Iran-related issues, and they are relatively brief analyses. Due to space constraints, the author will stop here. All of the above can also be verified through various channels, such as checking relevant reporting and investigation data.

The serious misconceptions that some Chinese people and Chinese-language users hold regarding Iran largely stem from forcibly projecting certain China-related frames onto the Iran issue, and then defining it through simplistic and unrealistic binaries such as “democracy versus authoritarianism” and “civilization destroying barbarism,” while making emotional and extreme comments that disregard the complexity of facts and the many-sided nature of the problems. This leads to distorted understanding of many basic facts about Iran, erroneous judgments, confused logic, and mistaken positions. (Moreover, China-related issues—especially China’s foreign-related issues—also cannot be reduced to a simple “democracy versus authoritarianism” or “civilization versus barbarism” dichotomy. One should not assume that U.S., European, or Japanese toughness toward China is goodwill, or that striking China will promote democracy. Issues of freedom and democracy are one matter, while issues of national and ethnic interests are another. Democratic countries are not necessarily kind or peaceful. On the contrary, because they may possess greater legitimacy and popular support, they can be even more aggressive than authoritarian states that prioritize internal stability. Europe and the United States may have somewhat more humanitarian sentiment, yet still place their own interests at the core. Japan and Israel are economically developed and provide good protections for their own citizens’ rights, but that does not mean they are benevolent toward foreigners; on the contrary, they often, for the sake of their own national and ethnic interests—many of which are unjust interests—commit more infringements against other countries and bully people of other ethnicities more.)

If one insists on pointing to similarities between China and Iran, there indeed are some: both countries occupy a marginal, relatively isolated position internationally; both face intense internal social contradictions; and external enemies, under the pretext of criticizing the regimes of China and Iran, are in fact harming the legitimate national and ethnic interests of both countries. The states and peoples of China and Iran suffer undeserved stigmatization and unfair treatment.

Because Iran has long been hostile to the West—especially the United States—and is also separated from and opposed to Sunni Islam, in a context where Western-led global public opinion and Sunni-led Muslim-world public opinion dominate, and because Iran is indeed authoritarian and has human-rights abuses, many negative aspects of Iran are amplified internationally while positive realities are ignored by mainstream discourse. This generates strong stereotypes among those with limited knowledge of Iran’s national conditions; what they know are partial facts. Many Chinese people, including liberals and opposition figures, both feel close to the West and lack sufficient information channels, and they also simplistically equate Iran with China. As a result, their aversion toward Iran becomes even stronger than that of others, they ignore complex realities, and they repeatedly make erroneous evaluations of Iran-related issues.

The author has no interest ties with Iran and obviously has no need to “whitewash” Iran. The reason the author seeks to clarify these issues is that sincere intellectuals and international observers, when faced with a chorus of uniform voices and a “one-sided” public opinion climate, should all the more pursue truth from facts, uphold objectivity, and promote balance—rather than embellish, follow the crowd, and add fuel to the fire. Moreover, whether in China’s domestic affairs, other countries’ affairs, or international issues, speaking up somewhat more for the weaker yet more reasonable side on the basis of facts, and applying more scrutiny and critique to the stronger yet unreasonable side, is precisely the stance and code of conduct that intellectuals, media workers, and people of conscience ought to uphold.

The author also hopes that people in China and around the world, regardless of their positions, should express their views and emotions on the premise of acknowledging basic facts, following logic, and offering reasoned arguments and evidence. Mistaken understandings, assumptions taken for granted, and wishful expectations will not bring about just and good outcomes.

( On the morning of September 28, 2023, I (Wang Qingmin (王庆民), a Chinese writer living in Europe) went to the Embassy of Iran in Germany. After taking a number and waiting in line, I handed my letter addressed to Iranian human rights protesters and those in power to a member of the Iranian staff.

I told the embassy staff that I hold rather friendly feelings toward Iran and do not wish to see the Iranian people killing one another. I hope that the Iranian government will end repression, achieve reconciliation and peace, protect human rights and improve people’s livelihoods domestically, and resist bullying by great powers externally, so that the Persian nation may be reshaped and reborn.

I have long felt sympathy and understanding toward Iran, especially toward the Persian nation. This is because its history, destiny, and present circumstances are similar to those of the Han Chinese in China. The Persian nation has a glorious history; later it was invaded by Islamic forces, converted to Shiism, and has long been besieged by Sunnis. After the 1979 Revolution, it has faced attacks and sanctions from various forces such as the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel.

Although Iran does indeed have serious human rights problems, this is not a justification for outsiders to bully it at will, and such attacks cannot improve Iran’s human rights situation.
The past several years, I have written many articles commenting on Iranian issues, and the year before last I also went to the Iranian embassy to deliver letters. My writings include A Century of Historical Change in Iran and the Turbulent Fate of Women（《伊朗百年历史变迁与女性命运的跌宕》）, Ode to Iranian Women (a poem)（《伊朗妇女颂》）, Iran amid Domestic Protests and External Attack Risks: Rethinking International Intervention（《伊朗内外交困与外部干预的复杂性》）, Several Controversies and Misconceptions in Chinese Public Opinion on the Iran Issue（《中文舆论对伊朗问题的若干争议和误区》）, Saudi–Iran Rapprochement: A Marriage of Convenience under Long-Term Rivalry（《沙特伊朗复交：两国长期争霸下的权宜之计》）, The Background of Israel’s Large-Scale Attacks on Iran and the Disappearance of Compromise and Peace in the Middle East（《以色列大举袭击伊朗的背景与中东妥协和平的消失》）, The 2024 Iranian Presidential Election: A Dull Contest between Conservatives and Reformists amid Internal and External Crises（《2024年伊朗总统选举：内忧外患下保守派与改革派的沉闷竞争》）, as well as this letter addressed to Iran’s rulers, opposition forces, and all sectors of society.

Regarding the protests in Iran in December 2025, I support the Iranian people in their pursuit of freedom, democracy, and improved livelihoods, while also opposing bullying and sanctions against Iran by the U.S. Republican Party and Israel. The international community should treat Iran and its people with sincerity and respect, and should distinguish dictators from the country and its people. It is even more necessary to oppose the United States and Israel exploiting the banner of freedom and democracy to take advantage of turmoil and practice hegemonism.)",chinese language opinion on iran misconceptions stereotypes undervalue reality iran under clerical rule still has some democracy and achievements u s israeli intervention exploits crisis iran needs more democracy and human rights judge facts objectively recently israel has launched large scale attacks on iran iran has retaliated and the united states has also directly intervened causing the situation to deteriorate rapidly this has drawn global attention to iran and china and the chinese language public sphere are no exception within chinese language discourse debates over the israel iran conflict and iran related issues have been particularly intense different groups to varying degrees project many iranian events and figures onto china related issues interpreting and commenting on them through their own positions and value systems based on their respective perceptions and imaginations however these commentaries are often highly subjective and shaped by preconceived notions they frequently involve misperceptions of iran and the israel iran conflict neglect or exaggeration of facts and distortions of right and wrong resulting in various misunderstandings and misconceptions here the author seeks to enumerate some of these misunderstandings and to clarify the issues and facts involved first many people simply regard iran as an authoritarian and totalitarian state believing that its regime or ruling group is dictatorial commits all manner of evils and stands in complete opposition to its people they equate it with regimes such as north korea s kim family rule or the taliban in afghanistan which they view as evil regimes based on this they conclude that the current iranian regime must be eliminated in order for the iranian people to achieve freedom and liberation this is not entirely accurate compared with standard democratic countries iran s current regime namely a dual system in which clerical and secular elements are integrated yet divided in their functions is indeed relatively authoritarian and power concentrated but it is not entirely devoid of democracy iran s president members of parliament and local administrative leaders such as the mayor of tehran are all elected directly by the people mostly through competitive elections with multiple candidates although candidates must be vetted and approved by clerical authorities the elections are still conducted on a one person one vote basis with multiple candidates and relatively secular and reformist figures frequently defeat conservative candidates favored by the clerical establishment former iranian presidents such as khatami rafsanjani and rouhani as well as the current president pezeshkian are all reformists inclined toward secularism although the iranian president more closely resembles a prime minister in countries with strong presidential systems responsible for day to day administration and implementation while the supreme leader formerly khomeini now khamenei is the highest leader and ultimate policymaker the iranian president still wields significant administrative and diplomatic power for example during rouhani s tenure efforts were made to promote market oriented economic reforms improve women s rights and improve relations with the united states and europe of course the supreme leader khamenei also tacitly permitted these reforms which itself indicates that even conservatives do not entirely reject certain enlightened changes by comparison many monarchies in the middle east such as saudi arabia the united arab emirates qatar jordan and bahrain are either outright autocracies without democracy or possess constitutional elements yet remain minimally democratic at best countries such as egypt syria and libya are ruled by military strongmen or fragmented warlord forces and likewise lack democracy clearly iran is in fact among the relatively more democratic countries in the middle east and the muslim world although it cannot be compared with highly democratic states and also falls short of islamic democracies such as turkey it is evidently not a fully authoritarian system let alone comparable to a country like north korea which can be said to have virtually zero democracy moreover in terms of domestic ethnic relations counterterrorism and treatment of ethnic minorities iran performs better than the vast majority of islamic countries and even better than most multiethnic countries elsewhere in the world the majority ethnic group in iran is persian alongside azerbaijanis kurds arabs and a very small jewish minority relations among these groups are relatively harmonious and none have suffered significant ethnic oppression although religious authoritarian oppression does exist terrorist attacks are also rare this is extremely rare and noteworthy when compared with the middle east where ethnic conflicts are severe and terrorist attacks frequent as well as with other countries where either majorities oppress minorities or small groups dominate larger populations second many people believe that iranian society has no freedom at all and that the social environment is extremely suffocating this too is a generalization that exaggerates reality after the iranian islamic revolution religious authorities did indeed impose constraints on the population through islamic law particularly restricting women s rights freedoms and even dress however due to a certain legacy of social openness from the pahlavi era as well as the longer standing influence of a relatively enlightened persian civilization the reality in iran is not one in which society is completely ruled by religious law as the clerical authorities might desire or as outsiders unfamiliar with the situation might imagine instead there remains a considerable degree of freedom in the more than three decades since khomeini s death religious and social policies have generally become more relaxed while enforcement can sometimes be strict more often local authorities turn a blind eye today iranian youth are highly westernized able to use platforms such as google and youtube with ease and wear jeans and fashionable clothing owing to iran s persian secular historical traditions religious atmosphere is also less intense than in other middle eastern countries dominated by arab populations under clerical rule and sharia law there exist many secular unwritten rules that help sustain social functioning of course in concrete terms urban middle classes enjoy greater freedom while rural areas are more conservative even so rural iran is still incomparable to taliban ruled afghanistan in after iranian woman mahsa amini was beaten to death by police for refusing to wear a headscarf nationwide protests erupted not only opposition figures protested against clerical authorities but even several members of iran s national football team who are part of the establishment openly expressed support the national team also repeatedly refused to sing the iranian national anthem during international matches to show solidarity with the protesters apart from a few individuals who were briefly detained most supporters suffered no serious consequences such circumstances demonstrate that iran retains a certain degree of freedom and space for dissent rather than being a totalitarian system with absolutely no freedom of expression although iranian women do face certain restrictions and some activists and feminists are persecuted in terms of education employment social status and daily life they still enjoy a notable degree of freedom and dignity women make up more than percent of students at iranian universities including the country s top institution the university of tehran iran has also produced many female directors actresses scientists and engineers examples include the prominent female roles and actresses in the oscar winning film a separation and iranian woman maryam mirzakhani receiving the fields medal the world s highest honor in mathematics in important sectors such as education healthcare and scientific research women s numbers and contributions are no less than those of men this grants many iranian women greater dignity and autonomy without needing to depend on men of course not only iranian women but iranian men as well have relatively high levels of education also surpassing those in most middle eastern countries this certainly does not mean that iranian women are free from constraints or repression but it is far from the stereotypical image of women having no rights or freedoms and living like servants iranian women protest partly because they are oppressed but also because they possess a stronger sense of dignity and autonomy as well as space in which to resist in more authoritarian countries with tighter control women and various dissenters may not even have the possibility of organizing large scale street protests and women s status is generally lower with far less awareness capacity or conditions for resistance in some economically developed islamic countries such as saudi arabia the united arab emirates and kuwait women may enjoy a fair amount of personal freedom in daily life but female labor participation rates are low independent living capacity is limited and women s status and autonomy are in fact inferior to those of iranian women who are broadly higher educated and widely employed as for iranian society as a whole although freedom is indeed insufficient it is not entirely absent and in fact exceeds that of some other middle eastern countries and several authoritarian countries in the east although iran s religious authoritarianism is pronounced compared with sunni islam shiite islam in iran has a stronger tendency toward reform and flexibility and is more inclined to adapt to practical needs it is therefore not as extreme or anti human as stereotypes suggest for example iran s policies toward transgender individuals and toward ethnic and religious minorities are more enlightened than those of sunni dominated systems the author does not claim that iran is highly democratic or highly free nor that shiism is particularly tolerant it is clear that iran lacks democracy and freedom and shiite clerical authoritarianism is certainly not inclusive however the degree to which a country is democratic or free should not be judged through simplistic binary thinking but rather assessed based on facts to arrive at a balanced and appropriate conclusion third many people believe that iran is a hegemonic power in the middle east an international rogue state that commits all kinds of evils and that it even seeks to develop nuclear weapons on this basis they regard iran as deeply evil and therefore deserving of attack and destruction in reality however over the past several decades iran s diplomatic and military behavior compared with that of many other countries in the middle east and the world has not been notably in violation of international law or international norms on the core issue at the center of diplomatic disputes the iranian nuclear issue iran did not violate the nuclear agreement it once reached with western countries after the revolution because the islamic regime opposed the united states while also refusing to align with the soviet bloc eastern europe china or india as khomeini put it neither west nor east only islam and because it stood in opposition to sunni forces that constitute the majority of the muslim world iran became quite isolated internationally this constrained its ability to project influence abroad and also forced it to be especially mindful of adhering to international rules so as not to give hostile countries such as the united states and israel an excuse to attack it during the khomeini era there was once talk of exporting the revolution but this in effect soon ceased amid severe internal and external pressures objectively this has instead made iran more self restrained rather than a bully toward others in the iran iraq war iran was the victim of aggression and the defensive side saddam hussein s iraq by contrast was supported at the time by the united states saudi arabia and others in its invasion of iran in the u s military shot down an iranian civilian airliner killing people including iranian nationals but because of iran s isolated position the incident was never properly resolved during the chaotic situation in afghanistan in the s compared with saudi arabia and other countries that aggressively exported wahhabi extremism and pakistan which fostered the taliban iran was relatively restrained even after iranian diplomats were massacred by the taliban and did not forcefully interfere in the internal affairs of this weaker neighboring country some people compare attacks on iran to the allied campaign against nazi germany and japan in world war ii this is clearly a false analogy over the past several decades iran has not launched wars of aggression against other countries nor has it committed atrocities such as massacring millions of unarmed people of other ethnicities or invading other countries and killing tens of millions of their soldiers and civilians as for the threatening rhetoric by iran s theocratic rulers toward israel such as calls to destroy israel these have remained at the level of words and have not been put into practice by contrast it is israel that has assassinated numerous iranian scientists and military personnel as for the so called shiite crescent formed by iran together with hezbollah in lebanon the alawite forces in syria pro iranian factions in iraq and the houthis in yemen this bloc is a defensive alliance of weaker and minority forces formed in response to sunni powers such as saudi arabia and the united arab emirates as well as israel although the establishment and activities of the shiite crescent have indeed exacerbated instability in the middle east if the actions of all parties in the region and beyond are viewed in an even handed manner iran s and shiite forces efforts at self preservation and counteraction are understandable and should not be singled out for unilateral condemnation as for the iranian nuclear issue anyone who examines the negotiations between the united states and iran prior to the trump administration as well as the relevant engagements by other western countries and the united nations along with related media reports and analyses can see that iran had long agreed in negotiations to abandon the development of nuclear weapons and subsequently fulfilled this commitment in exchange for the lifting of sanctions and the peaceful use of nuclear energy however after trump took office in he tore up the iran nuclear agreement in and reimposed sanctions showing complete contempt for contractual commitments this move also dealt a blow to iran s reformists who favored peace and closer ties with the west while empowering hardliners the negotiation process over the nuclear agreement itself demonstrates that iran was reasonable and acted in good faith this stands in stark contrast to another nuclear armed country north korea which refused to honor its commitments under the six party talks repeatedly conducted nuclear tests and engaged in blackmail against all sides fourth many people believe that attacks on iran by israel and the united states can eliminate iran s clerical authoritarian forces promote freedom and democracy in iran liberate the iranian people and free women from constraints this is in fact a case of chinese liberals and chinese language internet users forcibly projecting some of their own perceptions and ambitions regarding china related issues onto the iranian issue in order to vent their own emotions and demands while disregarding the facts themselves the netanyahu government in israel and the trump administration in the united states are both forces that strongly prioritize their own country and their own nation place their own national interests above all else are willing to harm the rights and even the lives of people in other countries and do not hesitate to undermine international law from their words deeds and the values they display it is clear that they do not genuinely care about human rights freedom or democracy in iran indeed netanyahu trump and their supporters themselves are quite hostile to feminism pluralistic democracy and checks and balances of power and they practice authoritarianism and suppress dissent at home when they speak of iran s authoritarian and corrupt regime and its oppression of the people this is merely a pretext for attacking iran and a means of sowing division among iranians they have not formulated any concrete or feasible plan to bring about regime change in iran or a transition from authoritarianism to democracy nor have they shown respect or care for the iranian state and people outside the regime instead they simply hope to strike and weaken this hostile country push it into deeper poverty and internal chaos and do so at the cost of harming iranian civilians and undermining iran s national interests and persian national dignity although attacks and sanctions by israel and the trump administration have indeed in objective terms dealt blows to iran s clerical ruling group the greater victims have been the iranian state and people moreover the clerical establishment can always select new figures to replace those eliminated while their capabilities may be inferior to their predecessors their rigidity and conservatism may well be even more severe than those who were decapitated long term sanctions and attacks on iran by the united states and israel have also produced the side effect of obstructing human rights progress by giving iran s domestic hardliners both justification and momentum to close the country off from the outside world and intensify internal repression iran has elected several reformist presidents such as rouhani and pezeshkian all of whom clearly expressed a desire to improve relations with the united states and the west rouhani even conveyed a non hostile attitude toward israel such as no longer denying the historical reality of the holocaust and refraining from claims of destroying israel iran is among the countries most suitable for peaceful evolution yet it was precisely trump s two terms in office and the dominance of republican hawks over foreign and military policy that destroyed the possibility of promoting further iranian openness and reform through peaceful and rational means allowing conservatives to gain the upper hand and providing them with excuses to pursue rigidly conservative policies the economic stagnation material shortages popular impoverishment and loss of national and civic dignity caused by sanctions blockades and military strikes imposed by the united states israel and other countries hostile to iran have also intensified internal contradictions and conflicts within iran different groups and individuals inside iran have become more prone to harming one another and the ruling clerical forces have inflicted even harsher damage on the populace than when the external diplomatic environment was more favorable the iranian people thus suffer from a dual oppression internal clerical authoritarianism and external imperial hegemony they have not obtained freedom democracy or liberation but instead have become poorer and more distressed many iranian opposition figures themselves have recognized these realities and amid israel s recent large scale attacks on iran have spoken out clearly against attacks by israel and the trump administration for example iranian feminist activist narges mohammadi who won the nobel peace prize in the long imprisoned iranian reformist politician mostafa tajzadeh and iranian scholar sadegh zibakalam who has been imprisoned multiple times for opposing the government have all explicitly opposed israel s attacks on iran and argued that israeli attacks and proposed u s participation in attacking iran cannot bring freedom liberation or democracy to iran only a small number of opposition figures such as reza pahlavi the son of the penultimate shah support israel s attacks on iran the majority oppose them of course figures such as nobel laureate narges mohammadi have also criticized the performance of iran s theocratic regime during this israel iran conflict but their criticism targets the regime s failure to protect the people and its allowing external enemies to exploit vulnerabilities as mohammadi stated for forty six years you have beaten the drums of war but built no shelters for the people treating them as tools of propaganda this must be overthrown they are not calling for the regime to surrender to israel or the united states iran certainly needs democracy but not through the unreasonable methods employed by israel and the trump administration such as tearing up the nuclear agreement without cause launching violent attacks or imposing comprehensive sanctions under a strategy of maximum pressure rather there should be both pressure and engagement linking sanctions to economic and trade relations as well as to human rights supporting iran s progressive forces in initiating change respecting the autonomy of the iranian people and gradually facilitating transformation moreover regardless of motivation israel s attacks on iran as well as actions such as the trump administration s assassination of iranian revolutionary guard commander qassem soleimani are all violations of international law lack legitimate justification seriously undermine international peace and the sovereignty of other countries and are detrimental to humanitarian principles and human rights if merely feeling threatened were sufficient justification to attack another country then by the same logic russia s putin regime attacking ukraine would also become legitimate if one supports ukraine in opposing russia while simultaneously supporting israel s attacks on iran this is clearly a double standard and forfeits moral credibility once such a precedent is set more countries will claim the same justification to attack neighboring states or hostile countries plunging the world into even greater warfare and chaos fifth quite a few chinese opposition figures believe that iran together with china and russia forms an evil axis jointly confronting the west and they further believe that israel and the united states striking iran can also strike and deter china and russia this misconception is even more detached from facts and farther from the truth than the previous ones whether historically or today iran and china and russia have never been especially close only in recent years out of a shared need to counter the west have they developed a loose cooperative relationship the so called china russia iran iron triangle is merely a far fetched invention by some ccp online propagandists some opposition figures and various people with their own stances who do not understand the realities for many years iran has faced attacks and sanctions from the united states and israel yet china and russia have not provided iran with any substantial or forceful support at most they import iranian oil and occasionally conduct joint military exercises but they have never directly provided military assistance or protection moreover iran often shows an inclination to cooperate with europe for example in oil development and infrastructure construction and this is precisely one reason why china and russia feel displeased with iran in addition iran has more actual democracy than china see the first section of controversies which is also an important reason why the ccp and iran are not close and why supporters of the chinese government feel antipathy toward iran after israel attacked iran in this round china and russia beyond verbal condemnation of israel and nominal support for iran have taken no substantive actions in political military or economic terms supporters of the chinese government the so called fifty centers and little pinks have even mocked iran s weakness mocked iran for electing a reformist president friendly toward the west and mocked iran s desire to improve relations with the west even if iran s current regime were to collapse it would not shake the ccp s rule in china or putin s rule in russia just as the collapse of saddam in iraq and gaddafi in libya did not affect the ccp and china or putin and russia although the collapse of iran s current regime would to some extent affect china s influence in the middle east that impact would also be limited countries such as saudi arabia the united arab emirates egypt and qatar are even more important partners for china than iran is and they are also more stable and reliable aligning with china s pragmatic economy first stability first diplomatic stance moreover if iran s current regime were overthrown and a new government emerged iran s economic and trade cooperation with china would not necessarily decrease and might even increase as seen after saddam s fall when china entered iraq s oil market on a large scale once sanctions were lifted and even if china s influence in the middle east were weakened what would be harmed would only be china s international competitiveness it would not bring about freedom and democracy in china furthermore u s assistance to israel in striking iran does not mean the united states would similarly strike china and russia trump striking iran while continuing to be friendly toward putin and russia and refusing to actively support ukraine is an example and in china policy and the taiwan issue trump would not treat the ccp s china the way he treats iran china and russia are both far stronger than iran their military strength economic scale and international influence are not comparable to iran s they also have greater cooperative value for the united states and for the trump administration trump also bullies the weak and fears the strong so of course he would not treat china and russia the same way let alone launch military attacks on them trump also admires strongman leaders such as xi jinping vladimir putin and kim jong un who put pragmatism above all else he is unwilling even to attack and overthrow north korea let alone countries like china and russia that are stronger and whose leaders suit his preferences even more trump and his aides attacking iran instead reveals the ugly nature of picking targets based on who they are and striking especially hard at countries and forces that still seek reason retain some ideals even if they are irrational religious zeal and carry some democratic color while choosing to let truly evil dictators go free the above misconceptions and the author s rebuttals are only part of the controversies involving iran related issues and they are relatively brief analyses due to space constraints the author will stop here all of the above can also be verified through various channels such as checking relevant reporting and investigation data the serious misconceptions that some chinese people and chinese language users hold regarding iran largely stem from forcibly projecting certain china related frames onto the iran issue and then defining it through simplistic and unrealistic binaries such as democracy versus authoritarianism and civilization destroying barbarism while making emotional and extreme comments that disregard the complexity of facts and the many sided nature of the problems this leads to distorted understanding of many basic facts about iran erroneous judgments confused logic and mistaken positions moreover china related issues especially china s foreign related issues also cannot be reduced to a simple democracy versus authoritarianism or civilization versus barbarism dichotomy one should not assume that u s european or japanese toughness toward china is goodwill or that striking china will promote democracy issues of freedom and democracy are one matter while issues of national and ethnic interests are another democratic countries are not necessarily kind or peaceful on the contrary because they may possess greater legitimacy and popular support they can be even more aggressive than authoritarian states that prioritize internal stability europe and the united states may have somewhat more humanitarian sentiment yet still place their own interests at the core japan and israel are economically developed and provide good protections for their own citizens rights but that does not mean they are benevolent toward foreigners on the contrary they often for the sake of their own national and ethnic interests many of which are unjust interests commit more infringements against other countries and bully people of other ethnicities more if one insists on pointing to similarities between china and iran there indeed are some both countries occupy a marginal relatively isolated position internationally both face intense internal social contradictions and external enemies under the pretext of criticizing the regimes of china and iran are in fact harming the legitimate national and ethnic interests of both countries the states and peoples of china and iran suffer undeserved stigmatization and unfair treatment because iran has long been hostile to the west especially the united states and is also separated from and opposed to sunni islam in a context where western led global public opinion and sunni led muslim world public opinion dominate and because iran is indeed authoritarian and has human rights abuses many negative aspects of iran are amplified internationally while positive realities are ignored by mainstream discourse this generates strong stereotypes among those with limited knowledge of iran s national conditions what they know are partial facts many chinese people including liberals and opposition figures both feel close to the west and lack sufficient information channels and they also simplistically equate iran with china as a result their aversion toward iran becomes even stronger than that of others they ignore complex realities and they repeatedly make erroneous evaluations of iran related issues the author has no interest ties with iran and obviously has no need to whitewash iran the reason the author seeks to clarify these issues is that sincere intellectuals and international observers when faced with a chorus of uniform voices and a one sided public opinion climate should all the more pursue truth from facts uphold objectivity and promote balance rather than embellish follow the crowd and add fuel to the fire moreover whether in china s domestic affairs other countries affairs or international issues speaking up somewhat more for the weaker yet more reasonable side on the basis of facts and applying more scrutiny and critique to the stronger yet unreasonable side is precisely the stance and code of conduct that intellectuals media workers and people of conscience ought to uphold the author also hopes that people in china and around the world regardless of their positions should express their views and emotions on the premise of acknowledging basic facts following logic and offering reasoned arguments and evidence mistaken understandings assumptions taken for granted and wishful expectations will not bring about just and good outcomes on the morning of september i wang

14,The Server Room Siege: When a Raid Became a Street Fight for India's Political Future,1q9hpgp,u_Head_Ebb4301,1,0,2026-01-10 22:26:21,Head_Ebb4301,"**KOLKATA**—At 10:30 AM on a Thursday, the whir of server fans on the fourth floor of a building in central Kolkata was drowned out by a different kind of buzz. Officials from India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED), armed with a search warrant, had arrived at an office linked to the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC). Their stated target: evidence in a long-running money laundering case linked to an alleged coal smuggling syndicate.

What they found instead was West Bengal’s most powerful politician physically blocking the doorway.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s dramatic, personal intervention—arriving at the raid site with a phalanx of her own police—wasn't just political theater. It was a raw, desperate gambit born from one core fear: that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the center wasn't after bank statements, but the electoral playbook of its primary regional rival. In the frantic legal petition her party later filed, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) claimed the true target was the ""confidential political data"" on those servers, including ""campaign strategy and electoral roll-related data"" for the make-or-break 2026 state elections.

This was no longer just an investigation. It was a constitutional street fight over data, power, and the very rules of democratic contest.

# The Prize Wasn't Paper, It Was Predictive Power

To understand the panic, you must understand I-PAC. It is not a neutral firm; it is the TMC’s strategic cortex. For years, it has built the party’s voter databases, run its sentiment analysis, and crafted its micro-targeting campaigns. The data on those servers represents millions of man-hours and crores of rupees—a crystal ball predicting voter behavior in every district.

The TMC’s petition to the Calcutta High Court was explicit: the ED’s seizure risked an ""impermissible intrusion"" into this intellectual fortress. For the opposition, the raid crossed a red line from investigating past crime to confiscating future strategy. It’s the political equivalent of an army having its battle plans captured before the war begins. This fear explains the unprecedented response—a Chief Minister personally placing her body between the state and her party’s servers, declaring she was saving her ""party’s strategy for the elections"" from being ""looted.""

# The Counter-Narrative: Law, Order, and Constitutional Breach

The BJP’s response was one of cold, procedural outrage. A high-level delegation marched to the Governor, accusing Banerjee of a ""serious breach of constitutional propriety."" Their narrative painted a picture of a lawless state where the line between a political party and the government machinery had vanished.

Their argument hinges on a simple, powerful question: If this was a legitimate investigation into a multi-crore coal smuggling and money laundering case—a case where the ED claims a hawala operator channeled funds to entities linked to I-PAC—why obstruct it? For the BJP, Banerjee’s theatrics were not the act of a defender of democracy, but of a guilty party shielding evidence. They framed the spectacle not as a data-protection stand but as the ""breakdown of the State machinery,"" an attempt to use police force to render a central agency ""toothless.""

# A Well-Rehearsed Play in a Long-Running War

The chilling genius of the Kolkata raid is that it fits a now-familiar national script. As one political commentator dryly noted, in India, nothing signals an election season like a central agency discovering ""impeccable timing.""

Officials from India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED), armed with a search warrant, had arrived at an office linked to the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC). Their stated target: evidence in a long-running money laundering case linked to an alleged coal smuggling syndicate.

What they found instead was West Bengal’s most powerful politician physically blocking the doorway.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s dramatic, personal intervention—arriving at the raid site with a phalanx of her own police—wasn't just political theater. It was a raw, desperate gambit born from one core fear: that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the center wasn't after bank statements, but the electoral playbook of its primary regional rival. In the frantic legal petition her party later filed, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) claimed the true target was the ""confidential political data"" on those servers, including ""campaign strategy and electoral roll-related data"" for the make-or-break 2026 state elections.

This was no longer just an investigation. It was a constitutional street fight over data, power, and the very rules of democratic contest.

# The Prize Wasn't Paper, It Was Predictive Power

To understand the panic, you must understand I-PAC. It is not a neutral firm; it is the TMC’s strategic cortex. For years, it has built the party’s voter databases, run its sentiment analysis, and crafted its micro-targeting campaigns. The data on those servers represents millions of man-hours and crores of rupees—a crystal ball predicting voter behavior in every district.

The TMC’s petition to the Calcutta High Court was explicit: the ED’s seizure risked an ""impermissible intrusion"" into this intellectual fortress. For the opposition, the raid crossed a red line from investigating past crime to confiscating future strategy. It’s the political equivalent of an army having its battle plans captured before the war begins. This fear explains the unprecedented response—a Chief Minister personally placing her body between the state and her party’s servers, declaring she was saving her ""party’s strategy for the elections"" from being ""looted.""

# The Counter-Narrative: Law, Order, and Constitutional Breach

The BJP’s response was one of cold, procedural outrage. A high-level delegation marched to the Governor, accusing Banerjee of a ""serious breach of constitutional propriety."" Their narrative painted a picture of a lawless state where the line between a political party and the government machinery had vanished.

Their argument hinges on a simple, powerful question: If this was a legitimate investigation into a multi-crore coal smuggling and money laundering case—a case where the ED claims a hawala operator channeled funds to entities linked to I-PAC—why obstruct it? For the BJP, Banerjee’s theatrics were not the act of a defender of democracy, but of a guilty party shielding evidence. They framed the spectacle not as a data-protection stand but as the ""breakdown of the State machinery,"" an attempt to use police force to render a central agency ""toothless.""

# A Well-Rehearsed Play in a Long-Running War

The chilling genius of the Kolkata raid is that it fits a now-familiar national script. As one political commentator dryly noted, in India, nothing signals an election season like a central agency discovering ""impeccable timing.""

This pattern is the opposition’s central allegation: that agencies like the ED and CBI have been weaponized as political tools.

I have been seeing a lot of posts from students confused about degrees like biotech and usually there's at least one template comment telling them to not do it because there are no jobs for BSc/MSc graduates. As someone who has been on this path for more than a decade now, I thought I should share my experience and thoughts in this area. Some of it might apply to BSc/MSc programs in general but I am much more familiar with Biotech then any other discipline.

Why instant negative judgment on BSc?

I see a lot of negativity around this career path and it is often looked down upon. I think a major issue right now is that no one is doing these courses willingly. Because BSc is relatively cheap and less demanding, people join it while they prepare for other competitive exams or they join it after they have exhausted all of their other options. BSc courses are full of former NEET aspirants who don't have much expectations from BSc anyway. I understand their pain and disappointment. But I also think, this has created a generally negative environment around this degree. This is often seen as the degree you get to fulfill graduation requirements for other exams like MBA or govt job exams. These are totally valid reasons to get this degree. My post is not for people who are on that path.

Are there non-research job options after BSc/MSc?

The answer is Yes. There are some job options in bigger cities. Are they any good? No. They are usually repetitive or intellectually unfulfilling jobs that pay peanuts. If you are lucky, you can get some low-skill job that only has graduation requirement from any science field.
But that's not what science degrees are about! BSc, MSc degrees are supposed to be research focused degrees. If you want a career in research, BSc+MSc(+PhD) come as a packaged deal. 

Is there any scope in research in India after BSc/MSc? 

The answer is ""it depends"". For any decent research position, you need to have a masters degree at least. Once you have that, you have two options:

Industry- If you made some ""Good decisions"" (read ahead for details) during your BSc and MSc, you can land a RnD job in industry. This would not pay you much initially (pay can be shockingly low) and can be very stressful (as most research jobs are). If you are patient enough, you can climb the ladder and get promoted to better scientist positions after a few years of experience but at some point, not having a PhD may stop your professional progress. 

Academia- You can land a JRF, lab tech, lab manager or core facility manager kinda jobs in academia and assistant professor jobs in mid universities but there's not much else. Growth in these jobs can be an issue. Many students do these jobs while they look for a PhD position.

What are some ""good decisions"" you make during your BSc/MSc?

1. Get into a serious program. If you can't get into IISER/IIT, try to get into central universies or colleges that have some research going on. Integrated programs are the best starting point if you want to pursue a career in research.
2. Join a general course like biochemistry, biotech or biomedical science. Gain as much of diverse knowledge as you can. You can specialise in your area of interest by gaining research experience in that area. For example, if you are interested in neuroscience, join a MSc biotech course instead of MSc neuroscience and then start looking for research internships in neuroscience labs. 
3. Network. Talk to your professors, talk to guest lecturers and invited scientists. Talk to your seniors. Learn about what they do and express that you want to gain research experience. 
4. Get some research experience in good labs. Try to get into a lab that's actively doing research and learn skills. Start from your 2nd/3rd year of college and work on as many research projects you can. Try to get into an IIT/IISER/central research institute lab. Don't be afraid to apply.
5. Try to learn unique and useful skills. Ask your professor what are some useful research techniques that are in demand in your field of choice. Cell culture, molecular biology, RDT are some examples.
6. Maintain a good gpa. You don't have to be the topper but an 8+ gpa with no backs goes a long way.
7. DON'T BE SCARED OF MATHS. A good scientist needs to be comfortable with maths. Coding is another necessary skill that you should have. At least know it good enough for data analysis and plotting.

All of this will help you get into a good PhD program.

What are the industry job options in India if you have a PhD?

Having a PhD opens a lot of doors for industry RnD jobs but there are a lot of PhD graduates in India now who don't want to continue in academia so the competition for scientist roles for PhDs is high and the number of positions are less. The pay isn't great either initially. Here I wanna mention that I don't know many people who are pursuing RnD industry roles in India after getting a PhD so my information may not be totally accurate and I may be missing some things. 

What are the academia job options if I have a PhD?

Most popular path in academia is being an assistant professor. This means very different things depending on the university you're in. In this post I will be talking about academia roles which have a significant research component because that's the deal you get at top universities and institutes. 

What does a professor in academia do?

You have your own lab. You write research proposals by yourself or in collaboration with other professors/scientists to get research grants. You hire undergrads, postgrads, phd students and/or postdoctoral fellows in your lab to work on these research projects with you. You generate and analyze data, write a research paper based on that and try to get it published. The more you publish the better it is for your career. This is the major part of your work. Apart from that, you have to teach classes (1 or 2 each semester) and have to do some admin duties.

Pathway to get into research in academia? 

a) BSc > MSc > PhD 

b) Btech > Mtech (optional) > PhD 

c) Int. MSc/BS-MS > PhD

(Some other variations of this also exist like MSc+MTech etc)

What is a PhD?

It is a research degree. You work on research projects by doing experiments and analyzing data.
You are mentored by your supervisor who is a professor. Together you write and publish research papers. It generally takes 4-6 years to finish a PhD but it depends on your supervisor and your research progress. In most PhD programs in India, you also need to take some classes and maintain a good gpa. 
BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CHOOSING A LAB!!!

Where to get a PhD from? 

Based on my experience in the IIT system and a few central research institutes, a common pattern among the faculty is the presence of international exposure in their resume. Many professors in IITs have got their PhD from US or EU. Most of them have at least an international postdoc experience. Central Universities seem to have a good mix of professors with foreign PhDs and PhD from top Indian institutes.

1. PhD in India- If you want to have a good research career, get it from top institutes. This doesn't only include IISERs, IISc and IITs but also central research institutes like TIFR, NCBS, NBRC, NII, NCCS, IGIB and many more. You need to clear exams like NET, GATE, JGEEBILS to get into these programs. Some say that PhDs in India take very long. I think it depends on your supervisor. I recommend looking up a lab's history of graduation time before joining it. You get paid some stipend during your PhD. It is usually not a lot but enough to support your daily expenses.

2. PhD abroad- This adds a lot to your resume. Your best options in this case are US and EU. US and EU have one of the best research environments in the world. You get good exposure and great research opportunities. In US, you get an assistantship for doing a PhD which usually means that your tuition is free and you get paid a stipend. You have to do a good amount of coursework and maintain good gpa which is why US PhDs may take a little longer. In EU you don't have to do any coursework afaik and you get some stipend. EU PhDs are usually 4-5 years. 

What happens after PhD?

If you want to secure a professor job, you usually need to get some significant postdoctoral research experience. Postsoc role is a much more matured research role. You get to plan projects and write grants. A person might do 1-3 protdocs.

After all of this, you build a nice enough profile to apply for a faculty positions and be an assistant professor. This is VERY competitive in India and abroad. In India you might also have to navigate a lot of politics. 

Conclusion: This career path is long, difficult and competitive. But you will succeed if you work hard and make good decisions. It is totally worth it if you're passionate about research. This will not give you quick or easy success. But it is VERY rewarding and imo much more interesting and fun than other STEM careers (just my opinion). Please don't take BSc/MSc career advice from people who are doing it unwillingly just to get a degree (I understand and respect their decision. No judgment).

There are many nuances to all of the things that I have mentioned. If you have more questions, please feel free to ask me in the comments. These are just my thoughts and observations based on my experience in this field. I could be wrong about some things or might have missed some things. Please feel free to correct me.

I don't want reveal any identifying information about myself but I have been working as a student researcher since 2017. I have worked in both academia and industry labs. I graduated from the IIT system and I am currently pursuing PhD from US at an R1 University.

doing research and learn skills start from your nd rd year of college and work on as many research projects you can try to get into an iit iiser central research institute lab don t be afraid to apply try to learn unique and useful skills ask your professor what are some useful research techniques that are in demand in your field of choice cell culture molecular biology rdt are some examples maintain a good gpa you don t have to be the topper but an gpa with no backs goes a long way don t be scared of maths a good scientist needs to be comfortable with maths coding is another necessary skill that you should have at least know it good enough for data analysis and plotting all of this will help you get into a good phd program what are the industry job options in india if you have a phd having a phd opens a lot of doors for industry rnd jobs but there are a lot of phd graduates in india now who don t want to continue in academia so the competition for scientist roles for phds is high and the number of positions are less the pay isn t great either initially here i wanna mention that i don t know many people who are pursuing rnd industry roles in india after getting a phd so my information may not be totally accurate and i may be missing some things what are the academia job options if i have a phd most popular path in academia is being an assistant professor this means very different things depending on the university you re in in this post i will be talking about academia roles which have a significant research component because that s the deal you get at top universities and institutes what does a professor in academia do you have your own lab you write research proposals by yourself or in collaboration with other professors scientists to get research grants you hire undergrads postgrads phd students and or postdoctoral fellows in your lab to work on these research projects with you you generate and analyze data write a research paper based on that and try to get it published the more you publish the better it is for your career this is the major part of your work apart from that you have to teach classes or each semester and have to do some admin duties pathway to get into research in academia a bsc msc phd b btech mtech optional phd c int msc bs ms phd some other variations of this also exist like msc mtech etc what is a phd it is a research degree you work on research projects by doing experiments and analyzing data you are mentored by your supervisor who is a professor together you write and publish research papers it generally takes years to finish a phd but it depends on your supervisor and your research progress in most phd programs in india you also need to take some classes and maintain a good gpa be very careful when choosing a lab where to get a phd from based on my experience in the iit system and a few central research institutes a common pattern among the faculty is the presence of international exposure in their resume many professors in iits have got their phd from us or eu most of them have at least an international postdoc experience central universities seem to have a good mix of professors with foreign phds and phd from top indian institutes phd in india if you want to have a good research career get it from top institutes this doesn t only include iisers iisc and iits but also central research institutes like tifr ncbs nbrc nii nccs igib and many more you need to clear exams like net gate jgeebils to get into these programs some say that phds in india take very long i think it depends on your supervisor i recommend looking up a lab s history of graduation time before joining it you get paid some stipend during your phd it is usually not a lot but enough to support your daily expenses phd abroad this adds a lot to your resume your best options in this case are us and eu us and eu have one of the best research environments in the world you get good exposure and great research opportunities in us you get an assistantship for doing a phd which usually means that your tuition is free and you get paid a stipend you have to do a good amount of coursework and maintain good gpa which is why us phds may take a little longer in eu you don t have to do any coursework afaik and you get some stipend eu phds are usually years what happens after phd if you want to secure a professor job you usually need to get some significant postdoctoral research experience postsoc role is a much more matured research role you get to plan projects and write grants a person might do protdocs after all of this you build a nice enough profile to apply for a faculty positions and be an assistant professor this is very competitive in india and abroad in india you might also have to navigate a lot of politics conclusion this career path is long difficult and competitive but you will succeed if you work hard and make good decisions it is totally worth it if you re passionate about research this will not give you quick or easy success but it is very rewarding and imo much more interesting and fun than other stem careers just my opinion please don t take bsc msc career advice from people who are doing it unwillingly just to get a degree i understand and respect their decision no judgment there are many nuances to all of the things that i have mentioned if you have more questions please feel free to ask me in the comments these are just my thoughts and observations based on my experience in this field i could be wrong about some things or might have missed some things please feel free to correct me i don t want reveal any identifying information about myself but i have been working as a student researcher since i have worked in both academia and industry labs i graduated from the iit system and i am currently pursuing phd from us at an r university,3,2026-01-10 22:06:30,NEGATIVE,0.9976233839988708,critical,2,True,2026-01-10 22:06:30

This stems from a recent high-profile incident: On January 7, 2026, an \*\*ICE agent\*\* fatally shot a woman named Renee Good during a migration operation in Minneapolis. This event has sparked widespread outrage, protests, and renewed criticism of aggressive immigration policies, including fears of arbitrary detentions, lack of due process, or even violence toward visitors perceived as ""foreign"" or from certain backgrounds.

Key examples include:

\- \*\*Mohamad Safa\*\*, a Lebanese diplomat and executive director of a UN-accredited NGO, publicly announced on X (formerly Twitter) that he cancelled his tickets, stating: ""The ICE may decide that I am a gang member, and I'll be locked in prison for a year with no charges, no hearing, no trial, no right to consult a lawyer, no phone call. The US is not safe to visit.""

\- Media outlets (such as AS USA, IndiaTimes, LatestLY, and Newsweek) report that \*\*thousands\*\* of overseas fans have cancelled tickets or travel plans, with figures cited ranging from \*\*over 10,000\*\* to as high as \*\*16,800\*\* or \*\*25,000+\*\* in the days following the shooting. These cancellations are attributed to fears of a ""climate of fear,"" potential racial profiling, detentions, or risks during travel to the U.S. for the tournament (co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in summer 2026).

\- Social media posts and calls for boycotts have amplified the issue, with users urging others to ""cancel your tickets"" and avoid the U.S. portion of the event due to perceived dangers from ICE enforcement.

These developments are tied to broader tensions, including the Trump administration's immigration crackdown (ongoing since early 2025), threats related to Mexico (a co-host), and human rights concerns raised by groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International about U.S. detention practices.

However, official FIFA sources show no mention of widespread cancellations impacting overall sales. Ticket demand remains extraordinarily high, with over \*\*150 million\*\* requests in recent phases and new low-price tiers (e.g., $60 ""Supporter Entry"" tickets) introduced. The tournament is still on track, with ongoing sales phases.

In summary, while the scale may be limited relative to total demand (millions of tickets expected), a notable wave of cancellations and boycott sentiment has emerged specifically linked to ICE-related fears and the Minneapolis incident.

23,"Why I Find It Hard to Believe in God, Personally",1q9g5o7,atheism,10,8,2026-01-10 21:25:03,ambay13,"Even if we grant the assumption that God exists, it does not follow that any particular religion is true. The existence of a god and the correctness of a specific religious doctrine are entirely different claims. When we look at religion not through faith but through probability, history, and human disagreement, a striking conclusion emerges. The chance that any one person has chosen the correct religion is extremely small.

Across our history, there have been thousands of religions, estimates range from roughly 4,000 to over 10,000, depending on how one counts sects and traditions. Within the major religions themselves, fragmentation is immense. Christianity alone contains hundreds of denominations. Islam has dozens of sects. Hinduism has thousands of philosophical and theological schools. These are not minor variations. They make mutually exclusive claims about who God is, what God wants, how salvation works, and what happens after death. They cannot all be correct. In fact, most of them must be wrong.

Yet nearly every believer is convinced they belong to the one correct tradition. This means that choosing a religion is effectively like being handed a single lottery ticket out of thousands, and almost everyone believes theirs is the winning one. From a statistical standpoint, this is deeply implausible.

This becomes even more troubling when we examine how people acquire their beliefs. If religious truth were real, objective, and discoverable in the way mathematics or medicine is, we would expect people around the world to converge on it over time. Instead, we observe the opposite. Religious belief tracks geography almost perfectly. A person born in Saudi Arabia is overwhelmingly likely to be Muslim. Someone born in India is likely Hindu. In Italy, Catholic. In Thailand, Buddhist. In Utah, Mormon. A person’s religion, and therefore their supposed eternal fate, is determined not by investigation or evidence, but by where they happened to be born.

This alone reveals that religious belief is primarily cultural inheritance, not truth detection. If salvation or eternal punishment depends on accepting the correct doctrine, then the universe operates in a way that is radically unfair. Billions of people are placed at a permanent disadvantage by sheer accident of birth. That directly violates any coherent notion of justice or moral consequence.

Even if we assume that one religion out of all those that have ever existed is correct, the numbers are devastating. If five thousand religions have existed, then 99.98 percent of all believers in history were wrong. Yet those people were just as sincere, devoted, and confident as modern believers. When someone today says, I know my religion is true, they are statistically indistinguishable from the billions of people who were wrong before them. Confidence does not correlate with correctness.

The situation is even worse when we consider internal religious conflict. Christianity alone is split into Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox who historically condemned each other. Within Protestantism there are Calvinists and Arminians who disagree on salvation. There are Trinitarians and non Trinitarians who do not even agree on the nature of God. These are not small disputes. They concern the core of the faith. If one version is right, the others must be wrong. So the odds are not one in a few thousand. They are one in tens of thousands.

All of this leads to a conclusion. Even if God exists, religious certainty is irrational. The most honest position is not that one specific tradition has discovered cosmic truth, but that humans, limited, culturally shaped, and historically divided, almost certainly have not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1q9g5o7/why_i_find_it_hard_to_believe_in_god_personally/,"Why I Find It Hard to Believe in God, Personally 8 Even if we grant the assumption that God exists, it does not follow that any particular religion is true.

They make mutually exclusive claims about who God is, what God wants, how salvation works, and what happens after death. They cannot all be correct. In fact, most of them must be wrong.

Yet nearly every believer is convinced they belong to the one correct tradition. This means that choosing a religion is effectively like being handed a single lottery ticket out of thousands, and almost everyone believes theirs is the winning one. From a statistical standpoint, this is deeply implausible.

This becomes even more troubling when we examine how people acquire their beliefs. If religious truth were real, objective, and discoverable in the way mathematics or medicine is, we would expect people around the world to converge on it over time. Instead, we observe the opposite. Religious belief tracks geography almost perfectly. A person born in Saudi Arabia is overwhelmingly likely to be Muslim. Someone born in India is likely Hindu. In Italy, Catholic. In Thailand, Buddhist. In Utah, Mormon. A person’s religion, and therefore their supposed eternal fate, is determined not by investigation or evidence, but by where they happened to be born.

This alone reveals that religious belief is primarily cultural inheritance, not truth detection. If salvation or eternal punishment depends on accepting the correct doctrine, then the universe operates in a way that is radically unfair. Billions of people are placed at a permanent disadvantage by sheer accident of birth. That directly violates any coherent notion of justice or moral consequence.

Even if we assume that one religion out of all those that have ever existed is correct, the numbers are devastating. If five thousand religions have existed, then 99.98 percent of all believers in history were wrong. Yet those people were just as sincere, devoted, and confident as modern believers. When someone today says, I know my religion is true, they are statistically indistinguishable from the billions of people who were wrong before them. Confidence does not correlate with correctness.

The situation is even worse when we consider internal religious conflict. Christianity alone is split into Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox who historically condemned each other. Within Protestantism there are Calvinists and Arminians who disagree on salvation. There are Trinitarians and non Trinitarians who do not even agree on the nature of God. These are not small disputes. They concern the core of the faith. If one version is right, the others must be wrong. So the odds are not one in a few thousand. They are one in tens of thousands.

All of this leads to a conclusion. Even if God exists, religious certainty is irrational. The most honest position is not that one specific tradition has discovered cosmic truth, but that humans, limited, culturally shaped, and historically divided, almost certainly have not.",why i find it hard to believe in god personally even if we grant the assumption that god exists it does not follow that any particular religion is true the existence of a god and the correctness of a specific religious doctrine are entirely different claims when we look at religion not through faith but through probability history and human disagreement a striking conclusion emerges the chance that any one person has chosen the correct religion is extremely small across our history there have been thousands of religions estimates range from roughly to over depending on how one counts sects and traditions within the major religions themselves fragmentation is immense christianity alone contains hundreds of denominations islam has dozens of sects hinduism has thousands of philosophical and theological schools these are not minor variations they make mutually exclusive claims about who god is what god wants how salvation works and what happens after death they cannot all be correct in fact most of them must be wrong yet nearly every believer is convinced they belong to the one correct tradition this means that choosing a religion is effectively like being handed a single lottery ticket out of thousands and almost everyone believes theirs is the winning one from a statistical standpoint this is deeply implausible this becomes even more troubling when we examine how people acquire their beliefs if religious truth were real objective and discoverable in the way mathematics or medicine is we would expect people around the world to converge on it over time instead we observe the opposite religious belief tracks geography almost perfectly a person born in saudi arabia is overwhelmingly likely to be muslim someone born in india is likely hindu in italy catholic in thailand buddhist in utah mormon a person s religion and therefore their supposed eternal fate is determined not by investigation or evidence but by where they happened to be born this alone reveals that religious belief is primarily cultural inheritance not truth detection if salvation or eternal punishment depends on accepting the correct doctrine then the universe operates in a way that is radically unfair billions of people are placed at a permanent disadvantage by sheer accident of birth that directly violates any coherent notion of justice or moral consequence even if we assume that one religion out of all those that have ever existed is correct the numbers are devastating if five thousand religions have existed then percent of all believers in history were wrong yet those people were just as sincere devoted and confident as modern believers when someone today says i know my religion is true they are statistically indistinguishable from the billions of people who were wrong before them confidence does not correlate with correctness the situation is even worse when we consider internal religious conflict christianity alone is split into catholics protestants and orthodox who historically condemned each other within protestantism there are calvinists and arminians who disagree on salvation there are trinitarians and non trinitarians who do not even agree on the nature of god these are not small disputes they concern the core of the faith if one version is right the others must be wrong so the odds are not one in a few thousand they are one in tens of thousands all of this leads to a conclusion even if god exists religious certainty is irrational the most honest position is not that one specific tradition has discovered cosmic truth but that humans limited culturally shaped and historically divided almost certainly have not,10,2026-01-10 21:25:03,NEGATIVE,0.997400164604187,communal,2,True,2026-01-10 21:25:03

**Discussion**

* Professor Lichtman opened the stream on the fifth anniversary of the January 6th Capitol attacks by highlighting the explosive recent testimony of Special Counsel Jack Smith, who appeared before Congress on New Year's Eve. Smith’s testimony confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results and prevent the peaceful transfer of power. Lichtman argued that Trump is actively attempting to rewrite this history, transforming a violent insurrection into a patriotic event by pardoning rioters under the false pretense that they were denied due process. The Professor drew a sharp parallel between these pardons and Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, a figure Lichtman identified as one of history's most notorious drug traffickers. Hernández had been convicted in US federal court for facilitating the importation of over 400 tons of cocaine into the United States, utilizing the Honduran military and police force to protect drug shipments. Lichtman emphasized that, contrary to Trump’s claims of unfair treatment, Hernández had received full due process during his prosecution, making his pardon a blatant act of rewriting history to justify criminal behavior.
* The conversation shifted to the Trump administration's declaration that it is now running Venezuela, a claim Lichtman dismantled by pointing out that Maduro's vice president was recently sworn in alongside delegations from American adversaries like Iran, Russia, and China. Lichtman condemned the administration's labeling of this intervention as a military operation and law enforcement mission, asserting these actions are illegal, immoral, and historically illiterate. He provided a detailed historical critique of US interventions, noting that toppling dictators often leads to worse outcomes, such as the power vacuum following Saddam Hussein's removal in Iraq, the chaos after Muammar Gaddafi's fall in Libya, and the rise of the brutal Pinochet dictatorship in Chile after the US-backed coup against the democratically elected Salvador Allende. He also referenced the 1954 US intervention in Guatemala, which overthrew the democratically elected government of Jacobo Árbenz and ultimately led to a decades-long civil war and the Silent Holocaust, a genocide against the Mayan people. Lichtman warned that the current resource extraction operation in Venezuela lacks any plan for governance and is purely motivated by oil interests.
* Lichtman and Sam discussed the administration's failure to secure international support for the Venezuela operation, noting that the United Nations Security Council and key NATO allies like Spain, France, and Denmark have openly condemned or refused to support the move. The Professor compared the administration's military operation rhetoric to Vladimir Putin’s use of terms like ""special military operation"" to justify the invasion of Ukraine, arguing that bombing a country and removing its leader constitutes an act of war regardless of the terminology used. They also highlighted the logistical absurdity of the operation, observing that major oil companies are reluctant to invest in Venezuela due to the political instability, prompting Trump to suggest using taxpayer money to subsidize these corporations—a move Lichtman contrasted with the administration's simultaneous cuts to social safety nets like Medicaid and food stamps.
* The discussion expanded to the administration's aggressive foreign policy rhetoric regarding Greenland, specifically Stephen Miller's assertion that the United States has a claim to the territory equal to that of Denmark. Lichtman refuted this by outlining Greenland's political evolution from a Danish colony in the 18th century to its integration into the Danish realm in 1953, the granting of home rule in 1979, and its achievement of self-government in 2009. He argued that Trump is misapplying the Monroe Doctrine—which was originally designed to prevent European colonization in the Western Hemisphere—to justify a new doctrine that essentially claims the US can seize territory at will. Lichtman warned that threatening a NATO ally like Denmark with a military takeover could shatter the alliance, as Article 5 of the NATO charter stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all.
* Lichtman analyzed the sudden withdrawal of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz from his gubernatorial reelection campaign, a move driven by Republicans effectively tying his administration to the Feeding Our Future scandal, a massive scheme involving the misappropriation of federal food aid intended for children. Lichtman noted that the Trump administration is using this controversy as a pretext to freeze ten billion dollars in social service funding for five Democratic-led states. The Professor further argued that this crackdown is specifically designed to target the Somali community in Minnesota, contrasting this aggressive enforcement with President Trump's history of pardoning white criminals who have committed similar financial crimes, thus exposing a racially biased double standard in the administration's application of justice.
* Lichtman criticized the Pentagon's newly announced review of the effectiveness of women in ground combat roles, characterizing it not as a good-faith inquiry but as a smokescreen orchestrated by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ultimately remove women from these positions. The Professor pointed to Hegseth's past record of explicitly stating women should not serve in combat and highlighted the hypocrisy of the administration threatening Senator Mark Kelly’s military rank and pension for reminding troops they are not required to follow illegal orders—a stance Hegseth himself had publicly supported in 2016.
* Finally, the Professor expressed deep frustration with the Department of Justice's failure to meet the deadline for releasing the Epstein files, noting that less than one percent of the documents have been produced despite previous claims that they were ready for release. Lichtman accused the administration of a combination of laziness, stupidity, and malice, pointing out the contradiction in Attorney General Pam Bondi’s earlier assertion that the files were on her desk versus her later claim that they did not exist, suggesting a deliberate effort to bury the information to protect political allies while exclusively investigating Democrats.

**Q&A Highlights**

**1. Explanation of BRICS and Its Relation to the Capture of Maduro:**  
Professor Lichtman described BRICS as an alliance of nations that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. He explained that these nations have been highly critical of the Trump administration's intervention in Venezuela and suggested that the operation against Maduro is part of a wider effort to destabilize this bloc of nations, pointing to the administration's other attempts to exclude South Africa from international meetings and its military aggressions against Iran. He characterized this foreign policy as a kind of low-budget version of the axis of evil, aimed at undermining any country that challenges American dominance.

**2. Possibility of Future Military Moves Against Colombia, Cuba, and Greenland:**  
Professor Lichtman warned that the military operation in Venezuela is likely not a one-time event but rather the beginning of a broader policy of aggression. He cited rhetoric from both Donald Trump and senior advisor Stephen Miller indicating potential actions against other nations, including Colombia, Cuba, and even Greenland. Lichtman described this approach as a smash and grab strategy focused on resource seizure and projecting power. While he noted it is impossible to know if these threats will materialize, he stressed that the administration's stated intentions suggest further military interventions are a real possibility.

**3. Comparison of US Monetary Aid in Iraq to Venezuela and Oil Company Investment:**  
Professor Lichtman affirmed the parallel between the potential situation in Venezuela and the aftermath of the Iraq War, where the US spent vast sums to stabilize a deteriorating society. He expressed strong doubts that major oil companies would willingly invest in rebuilding Venezuela's infrastructure, given that corporations prioritize stability and certainty above all else. Lichtman highlighted the profound hypocrisy of the administration proposing to use American taxpayer money to subsidize some of the world's richest corporations while simultaneously cutting essential domestic programs like Medicaid and food stamps. He concluded that it is unlikely even the current Republican-controlled House would approve such funding, and it would have zero chance if Democrats regain control.

**4. Impact of Educating the Public on the Draft and Its Potential Reinstatement:**  
Professor Lichtman stated he would be profoundly shocked if the military draft were to be reinstated. He explained that the draft, which has not been used since the Nixon administration ended it in 1973, is now considered politically toxic. While he acknowledged from his personal experience of being drafted during the Vietnam War that conscription can powerfully galvanize anti-war movements, he argued that the immense political backlash any modern president or Congress would face makes its return almost unimaginable.

**5. Venezuelan Action Signifying Peak Oil and the Logic of Invasion:**  
Professor Lichtman firmly rejected the idea that invading Venezuela signals that the world is running out of oil. He pointed out that the United States is a net exporter of oil and has no desperate need for Venezuela's specific type of heavy crude. He argued that the administration's true motivation is its commitment to expanding the use of fossil fuels, in direct defiance of overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. Lichtman cited the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as bomb cyclones and massive wildfires, as proof that the planet is nearing a tipping point, making the administration's actions a dangerous pursuit of plunder.

**6. Parallels Between Stephen Miller Running Venezuela and Paul Bremer in Iraq:**  
Professor Lichtman fully endorsed the comparison between Stephen Miller potentially governing Venezuela and L. Paul Bremer's disastrous administration of post-invasion Iraq. He called the notion of placing an incompetent and immoral figure like Miller in charge of a nation of nearly 30 million people a recipe for catastrophe. Lichtman explained that Bremer's key decisions in Iraq, such as disbanding the Iraqi army and purging Ba'ath party members from government, directly fueled the insurgency and chaos that followed. He held up this history as a critical cautionary tale that the current administration is foolishly ignoring.

**7. Strategies for Legitimate Political Opposition and the Demonization of Progressives:**  
Professor Lichtman advised Democrats to study Harry Truman’s successful 1948 presidential campaign as a model for combating accusations of socialism. He detailed how Truman, despite being written off by pundits and attacked as a leftist, embarked on a nationwide grassroots whistle-stop train tour. On this tour, Truman directly attacked the unproductive do-nothing Congress and passionately advocated for progressive policies like national health reform, affordable housing, and civil rights. Lichtman urged today's Democrats to stop being defensive and instead proudly campaign on their historic achievements, such as Social Security and the Affordable Care Act.

**8. Comparing Trump’s Actions to Andrew Jackson’s Trail of Tears and Polk’s Manifest Destiny:**  
Professor Lichtman agreed that Trump’s actions are on a similar moral level as some of the darkest chapters in American history. He specifically compared them to Andrew Jackson’s forced removal of Native Americans on the Trail of Tears and James K. Polk’s instigation of the Mexican-American War. However, Lichtman drew a crucial distinction: while Polk's war, though racist and aggressive, resulted in a massive expansion of US territory, including California and the Southwest, Trump's actions offer no such strategic or tangible benefit to the country. They are purely destructive, creating chaos with no positive outcome.

**9. Democratic Failure to Highlight Student Loan Garnishments:**  
Professor Lichtman concurred that Democrats should be making the issue of student loan garnishments a major focus. He framed the administration's policy as a punitive attack on ordinary Americans who sought to better themselves through education, many of whom were victims of predatory for-profit colleges. He contrasted this harsh stance against student borrowers with the administration's willingness to provide enormous financial benefits and tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations, arguing this stark hypocrisy is a powerful political issue that Democrats are failing to exploit.

**10. Likelihood of a Coalition Imposing Sanctions on the US and Global Economic Impact:**  
Professor Lichtman explained that a broad international coalition is highly unlikely to impose sanctions on the United States, despite global outrage at its actions. The reason, he stated, is that the US economy is the largest and most central to the global financial system. He argued that any attempt to sanction the United States would trigger a devastating worldwide economic collapse. This reality serves as a powerful deterrent, forcing even the most critical allies to moderate their responses and avoid direct economic confrontation.

**11. Odds of Trump Remaining in Power Until the End of His Term Amidst Scandals:**  
Professor Lichtman suggested that Trump’s hold on power is showing signs of weakening. He pointed to polling on the Venezuela intervention, which has less than 40 percent support and has failed to produce the expected rally-around-the-flag effect seen in past military conflicts. He believes that while a politically motivated removal from office is improbable because the Senate would never convict him, the most significant threat to Trump serving his full term is his personal health.

**12. Historical View of Trump’s Reelection After January 6th and Comparable Controversies:**  
Professor Lichtman asserted that there is no historical precedent for a US president being reelected after a controversy on the scale of January 6th. He reviewed major presidential scandals like the Teapot Dome scandal and Watergate, noting a consistent pattern: these events either occurred during a president's second term or led directly to their resignation or decision not to seek reelection. He concluded that Trump’s political survival and return to power after inciting an insurrection is a unique event in American history, making its long-term perception difficult to predict.

**13. Psychology Behind the Republican Obsession with Conspiracy Theories:**  
Professor Lichtman, while clarifying he is not a psychologist, explained that conspiracy theories are appealing because they offer simple explanations for complex problems and consistently blame an external group or other. This allows believers to avoid self-reflection or responsibility. He noted that these theories frequently target groups like immigrants, feminists, and Jews. To illustrate the mindset, he told a joke from the Weimar Republic about a rabbi who preferred reading a Nazi newspaper because, unlike the Jewish press which detailed persecution, the Nazi paper claimed Jews secretly controlled the world, offering a perverse sense of power.

**14. Consequences if the Supreme Court Guts the Voting Rights Act:**  
Professor Lichtman described a potential Supreme Court decision to gut the Voting Rights Act as a body blow to American democracy. He reminded the audience that President Ronald Reagan called the Act the crown jewel of American law because it finally dismantled the Jim Crow systems that had disenfranchised Black voters for a century. Lichtman warned that nullifying this law would be a tragic step backward, reopening the door to discriminatory voting practices and severely damaging the principle of one person, one vote.

**15. Congressional Actions to Prevent Another Insurrection:**  
Professor Lichtman stated that the current Republican-controlled Congress is doing nothing to prevent a future insurrection, largely because its members have embraced the false narrative that January 6th was a patriotic protest. He did, however, credit the previous Congress with taking a meaningful step by passing the Electoral Count Reform Act. He explained that this law clarified that the Vice President's role in counting electoral votes is purely ceremonial and significantly raised the threshold for members of Congress to object to a state's certified results, thereby strengthening the process against future attempts at subversion.

**16. Potential Coverage of the 2026 Quebec Election:**  
In response to a viewer's question, Professor Lichtman expressed interest in potentially covering the 2026 Quebec election. He mentioned his fondness for Quebec from his travels there and said that, having been alerted to the upcoming election, he would keep it on his radar and possibly discuss it as it draws closer.

**17. California Voting to Join Denmark and European Fear of Trump:**  
Professor Lichtman used a viewer's satirical question about California joining Denmark to address the genuine and profound fear among European allies regarding the Trump administration. He explained that the threat to take over Greenland has created an unprecedented rift within NATO. If the US were to act, it could theoretically trigger Article 5 of the NATO charter, placing member nations in the impossible position of having to defend Denmark, a fellow member, against the United States, the leader of the alliance. This potential for the complete collapse of the Western security alliance is a source of terror in European capitals.

**18. Role of Hugo Chavez Versus Maduro in Venezuela’s Economic Collapse:**  
Professor Lichtman laid the blame for Venezuela's economic ruin on both Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro. He explained that Chavez initiated the country's decline with policies that weakened the vital oil industry and eroded democratic institutions. Maduro, he continued, then took a bad situation and made it catastrophically worse, accelerating the economic mismanagement and intensifying the authoritarian crackdown into a full-blown dictatorship.

**19. Public Support for Regime Change Compared to the Truman Presidency:**

Professor Lichtman stated unequivocally that American public opinion no longer supports the kind of interventionist regime-change policies that were common during the early Cold War. He used polling data showing that over 70 percent of Americans oppose the US taking over the governance of Venezuela as concrete proof of this shift. He contrasted this modern sentiment with the broad support President Truman received for his policies of containing communism, highlighting how much the public's appetite for foreign intervention has diminished.

**20. Viability of Venezuelan Oil and Trump as a Power Bully:**  
Professor Lichtman confirmed that Venezuelan oil presents significant logistical challenges, as it is a heavy crude that is difficult to extract and requires specialized refineries. He also referenced expert opinions that it could take anywhere from two to ten years to restore its production. For these reasons, he agreed with the analysis that the intervention is less about a practical plan to secure oil and more about Donald Trump acting as a power bully on the world stage. He concluded that the entire operation has the hallmarks of a Wag the Dog scenario: a manufactured foreign crisis intended to distract voters from pressing domestic issues like the struggling job market and rising healthcare premiums.

**Conclusion**

Professor Lichtman concluded the livestream by urging viewers to remain vigilant. He framed the current period of unprecedented political chaos and international aggression not as a peak, but as the very start of a new, turbulent era, advising viewers that what we are witnessing is merely the beginning of the beginning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/13KeysToTheWhiteHouse/comments/1q98c0e/recap_trumps_actions_in_venezuela_were_illegal/,"(RECAP) Trump's Actions in Venezuela were ILLEGAL!!! | Lichtman Live #194 0 **Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/live/EpDZ6MXX-5g](https://www.youtube.com/live/EpDZ6MXX-5g)

Lichtman highlighted the profound hypocrisy of the administration proposing to use American taxpayer money to subsidize some of the world's richest corporations while simultaneously cutting essential domestic programs like Medicaid and food stamps. He concluded that it is unlikely even the current Republican-controlled House would approve such funding, and it would have zero chance if Democrats regain control.

**4. Impact of Educating the Public on the Draft and Its Potential Reinstatement:**  
Professor Lichtman stated he would be profoundly shocked if the military draft were to be reinstated. He explained that the draft, which has not been used since the Nixon administration ended it in 1973, is now considered politically toxic. While he acknowledged from his personal experience of being drafted during the Vietnam War that conscription can powerfully galvanize anti-war movements, he argued that the immense political backlash any modern president or Congress would face makes its return almost unimaginable.

**5. Venezuelan Action Signifying Peak Oil and the Logic of Invasion:**  
Professor Lichtman firmly rejected the idea that invading Venezuela signals that the world is running out of oil. He pointed out that the United States is a net exporter of oil and has no desperate need for Venezuela's specific type of heavy crude. He argued that the administration's true motivation is its commitment to expanding the use of fossil fuels, in direct defiance of overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. Lichtman cited the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as bomb cyclones and massive wildfires, as proof that the planet is nearing a tipping point, making the administration's actions a dangerous pursuit of plunder.

**6. Parallels Between Stephen Miller Running Venezuela and Paul Bremer in Iraq:**  
Professor Lichtman fully endorsed the comparison between Stephen Miller potentially governing Venezuela and L. Paul Bremer's disastrous administration of post-invasion Iraq. He called the notion of placing an incompetent and immoral figure like Miller in charge of a nation of nearly 30 million people a recipe for catastrophe. Lichtman explained that Bremer's key decisions in Iraq, such as disbanding the Iraqi army and purging Ba'ath party members from government, directly fueled the insurgency and chaos that followed. He held up this history as a critical cautionary tale that the current administration is foolishly ignoring.

**7. Strategies for Legitimate Political Opposition and the Demonization of Progressives:**  
Professor Lichtman advised Democrats to study Harry Truman’s successful 1948 presidential campaign as a model for combating accusations of socialism. He detailed how Truman, despite being written off by pundits and attacked as a leftist, embarked on a nationwide grassroots whistle-stop train tour. On this tour, Truman directly attacked the unproductive do-nothing Congress and passionately advocated for progressive policies like national health reform, affordable housing, and civil rights. Lichtman urged today's Democrats to stop being defensive and instead proudly campaign on their historic achievements, such as Social Security and the Affordable Care Act.

**8. Comparing Trump’s Actions to Andrew Jackson’s Trail of Tears and Polk’s Manifest Destiny:**  
Professor Lichtman agreed that Trump’s actions are on a similar moral level as some of the darkest chapters in American history. He specifically compared them to Andrew Jackson’s forced removal of Native Americans on the Trail of Tears and James K. Polk’s instigation of the Mexican-American War. However, Lichtman drew a crucial distinction: while Polk's war, though racist and aggressive, resulted in a massive expansion of US territory, including California and the Southwest, Trump's actions offer no such strategic or tangible benefit to the country. They are purely destructive, creating chaos with no positive outcome.

**9. Democratic Failure to Highlight Student Loan Garnishments:**  
Professor Lichtman concurred that Democrats should be making the issue of student loan garnishments a major focus. He framed the administration's policy as a punitive attack on ordinary Americans who sought to better themselves through education, many of whom were victims of predatory for-profit colleges. He contrasted this harsh stance against student borrowers with the administration's willingness to provide enormous financial benefits and tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations, arguing this stark hypocrisy is a powerful political issue that Democrats are failing to exploit.

**10. Likelihood of a Coalition Imposing Sanctions on the US and Global Economic Impact:**  
Professor Lichtman explained that a broad international coalition is highly unlikely to impose sanctions on the United States, despite global outrage at its actions. The reason, he stated, is that the US economy is the largest and most central to the global financial system. He argued that any attempt to sanction the United States would trigger a devastating worldwide economic collapse. This reality serves as a powerful deterrent, forcing even the most critical allies to moderate their responses and avoid direct economic confrontation.

**11. Odds of Trump Remaining in Power Until the End of His Term Amidst Scandals:**  
Professor Lichtman suggested that Trump’s hold on power is showing signs of weakening. He pointed to polling on the Venezuela intervention, which has less than 40 percent support and has failed to produce the expected rally-around-the-flag effect seen in past military conflicts. He believes that while a politically motivated removal from office is improbable because the Senate would never convict him, the most significant threat to Trump serving his full term is his personal health.

**12. Historical View of Trump’s Reelection After January 6th and Comparable Controversies:**  
Professor Lichtman asserted that there is no historical precedent for a US president being reelected after a controversy on the scale of January 6th. He reviewed major presidential scandals like the Teapot Dome scandal and Watergate, noting a consistent pattern: these events either occurred during a president's second term or led directly to their resignation or decision not to seek reelection. He concluded that Trump’s political survival and return to power after inciting an insurrection is a unique event in American history, making its long-term perception difficult to predict.

**13. Psychology Behind the Republican Obsession with Conspiracy Theories:**  
Professor Lichtman, while clarifying he is not a psychologist, explained that conspiracy theories are appealing because they offer simple explanations for complex problems and consistently blame an external group or other. This allows believers to avoid self-reflection or responsibility. He noted that these theories frequently target groups like immigrants, feminists, and Jews. To illustrate the mindset, he told a joke from the Weimar Republic about a rabbi who preferred reading a Nazi newspaper because, unlike the Jewish press which detailed persecution, the Nazi paper claimed Jews secretly controlled the world, offering a perverse sense of power.

**14. Consequences if the Supreme Court Guts the Voting Rights Act:**  
Professor Lichtman described a potential Supreme Court decision to gut the Voting Rights Act as a body blow to American democracy. He reminded the audience that President Ronald Reagan called the Act the crown jewel of American law because it finally dismantled the Jim Crow systems that had disenfranchised Black voters for a century. Lichtman warned that nullifying this law would be a tragic step backward, reopening the door to discriminatory voting practices and severely damaging the principle of one person, one vote.

**15. Congressional Actions to Prevent Another Insurrection:**  
Professor Lichtman stated that the current Republican-controlled Congress is doing nothing to prevent a future insurrection, largely because its members have embraced the false narrative that January 6th was a patriotic protest. He did, however, credit the previous Congress with taking a meaningful step by passing the Electoral Count Reform Act. He explained that this law clarified that the Vice President's role in counting electoral votes is purely ceremonial and significantly raised the threshold for members of Congress to object to a state's certified results, thereby strengthening the process against future attempts at subversion.

**16. Potential Coverage of the 2026 Quebec Election:**  
In response to a viewer's question, Professor Lichtman expressed interest in potentially covering the 2026 Quebec election. He mentioned his fondness for Quebec from his travels there and said that, having been alerted to the upcoming election, he would keep it on his radar and possibly discuss it as it draws closer.

**17. California Voting to Join Denmark and European Fear of Trump:**  
Professor Lichtman used a viewer's satirical question about California joining Denmark to address the genuine and profound fear among European allies regarding the Trump administration. He explained that the threat to take over Greenland has created an unprecedented rift within NATO. If the US were to act, it could theoretically trigger Article 5 of the NATO charter, placing member nations in the impossible position of having to defend Denmark, a fellow member, against the United States, the leader of the alliance. This potential for the complete collapse of the Western security alliance is a source of terror in European capitals.

**18. Role of Hugo Chavez Versus Maduro in Venezuela’s Economic Collapse:**  
Professor Lichtman laid the blame for Venezuela's economic ruin on both Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro. He explained that Chavez initiated the country's decline with policies that weakened the vital oil industry and eroded democratic institutions. Maduro, he continued, then took a bad situation and made it catastrophically worse, accelerating the economic mismanagement and intensifying the authoritarian crackdown into a full-blown dictatorship.

**19. Public Support for Regime Change Compared to the Truman Presidency:**

Professor Lichtman stated unequivocally that American public opinion no longer supports the kind of interventionist regime-change policies that were common during the early Cold War. He used polling data showing that over 70 percent of Americans oppose the US taking over the governance of Venezuela as concrete proof of this shift. He contrasted this modern sentiment with the broad support President Truman received for his policies of containing communism, highlighting how much the public's appetite for foreign intervention has diminished.

**20. Viability of Venezuelan Oil and Trump as a Power Bully:**  
Professor Lichtman confirmed that Venezuelan oil presents significant logistical challenges, as it is a heavy crude that is difficult to extract and requires specialized refineries. He also referenced expert opinions that it could take anywhere from two to ten years to restore its production. For these reasons, he agreed with the analysis that the intervention is less about a practical plan to secure oil and more about Donald Trump acting as a power bully on the world stage. He concluded that the entire operation has the hallmarks of a Wag the Dog scenario: a manufactured foreign crisis intended to distract voters from pressing domestic issues like the struggling job market and rising healthcare premiums.

**Conclusion**

Professor Lichtman concluded the livestream by urging viewers to remain vigilant. He framed the current period of unprecedented political chaos and international aggression not as a peak, but as the very start of a new, turbulent era, advising viewers that what we are witnessing is merely the beginning of the beginning.",recap trump s actions in venezuela were illegal lichtman live link if you find any inaccuracies in this summary please don t hesitate to let me know and i ll make the necessary corrections accordingly discussion professor lichtman opened the stream on the fifth anniversary of the january th capitol attacks by highlighting the explosive recent testimony of special counsel jack smith who appeared before congress on new year s eve smith s testimony confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt that donald trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the election results and prevent the peaceful transfer of power lichtman argued that trump is actively attempting to rewrite this history transforming a violent insurrection into a patriotic event by pardoning rioters under the false pretense that they were denied due process the professor drew a sharp parallel between these pardons and trump s pardon of former honduran president juan orlando hern ndez a figure lichtman identified as one of history s most notorious drug traffickers hern ndez had been convicted in us federal court for facilitating the importation of over tons of cocaine into the united states utilizing the honduran military and police force to protect drug shipments lichtman emphasized that contrary to trump s claims of unfair treatment hern ndez had received full due process during his prosecution making his pardon a blatant act of rewriting history to justify criminal behavior the conversation shifted to the trump administration s declaration that it is now running venezuela a claim lichtman dismantled by pointing out that maduro s vice president was recently sworn in alongside delegations from american adversaries like iran russia and china lichtman condemned the administration s labeling of this intervention as a military operation and law enforcement mission asserting these actions are illegal immoral and historically illiterate he provided a detailed historical critique of us interventions noting that toppling dictators often leads to worse outcomes such as the power vacuum following saddam hussein s removal in iraq the chaos after muammar gaddafi s fall in libya and the rise of the brutal pinochet dictatorship in chile after the us backed coup against the democratically elected salvador allende he also referenced the us intervention in guatemala which overthrew the democratically elected government of jacobo rbenz and ultimately led to a decades long civil war and the silent holocaust a genocide against the mayan people lichtman warned that the current resource extraction operation in venezuela lacks any plan for governance and is purely motivated by oil interests lichtman and sam discussed the administration s failure to secure international support for the venezuela operation noting that the united nations security council and key nato allies like spain france and denmark have openly condemned or refused to support the move the professor compared the administration s military operation rhetoric to vladimir putin s use of terms like special military operation to justify the invasion of ukraine arguing that bombing a country and removing its leader constitutes an act of war regardless of the terminology used they also highlighted the logistical absurdity of the operation observing that major oil companies are reluctant to invest in venezuela due to the political instability prompting trump to suggest using taxpayer money to subsidize these corporations a move lichtman contrasted with the administration s simultaneous cuts to social safety nets like medicaid and food stamps the discussion expanded to the administration s aggressive foreign policy rhetoric regarding greenland specifically stephen miller s assertion that the united states has a claim to the territory equal to that of denmark lichtman refuted this by outlining greenland s political evolution from a danish colony in the th century to its integration into the danish realm in the granting of home rule in and its achievement of self government in he argued that trump is misapplying the monroe doctrine which was originally designed to prevent european colonization in the western hemisphere to justify a new doctrine that essentially claims the us can seize territory at will lichtman warned that threatening a nato ally like denmark with a military takeover could shatter the alliance as article of the nato charter stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all lichtman analyzed the sudden withdrawal of minnesota governor tim walz from his gubernatorial reelection campaign a move driven by republicans effectively tying his administration to the feeding our future scandal a massive scheme involving the misappropriation of federal food aid intended for children lichtman noted that the trump administration is using this controversy as a pretext to freeze ten billion dollars in social service funding for five democratic led states the professor further argued that this crackdown is specifically designed to target the somali community in minnesota contrasting this aggressive enforcement with president trump s history of pardoning white criminals who have committed similar financial crimes thus exposing a racially biased double standard in the administration s application of justice lichtman criticized the pentagon s newly announced review of the effectiveness of women in ground combat roles characterizing it not as a good faith inquiry but as a smokescreen orchestrated by defense secretary pete hegseth to ultimately remove women from these positions the professor pointed to hegseth s past record of explicitly stating women should not serve in combat and highlighted the hypocrisy of the administration threatening senator mark kelly s military rank and pension for reminding troops they are not required to follow illegal orders a stance hegseth himself had publicly supported in finally the professor expressed deep frustration with the department of justice s failure to meet the deadline for releasing the epstein files noting that less than one percent of the documents have been produced despite previous claims that they were ready for release lichtman accused the administration of a combination of laziness stupidity and malice pointing out the contradiction in attorney general pam bondi s earlier assertion that the files were on her desk versus her later claim that they did not exist suggesting a deliberate effort to bury the information to protect political allies while exclusively investigating democrats q a highlights explanation of brics and its relation to the capture of maduro professor lichtman described brics as an alliance of nations that includes brazil russia india china and south africa he explained that these nations have been highly critical of the trump administration s intervention in venezuela and suggested that the operation against maduro is part of a wider effort to destabilize this bloc of nations pointing to the administration s other attempts to exclude south africa from international meetings and its military aggressions against iran he characterized this foreign policy as a kind of low budget version of the axis of evil aimed at undermining any country that challenges american dominance possibility of future military moves against colombia cuba and greenland professor lichtman warned that the military operation in venezuela is likely not a one time event but rather the beginning of a broader policy of aggression he cited rhetoric from both donald trump and senior advisor stephen miller indicating potential actions against other nations including colombia cuba and even greenland lichtman described this approach as a smash and grab strategy focused on resource seizure and projecting power while he noted it is impossible to know if these threats will materialize he stressed that the administration s stated intentions suggest further military interventions are a real possibility comparison of us monetary aid in iraq to venezuela and oil company investment

Colonised by Spain for 300 years, and then colonised by USA for 50 years. Their labour is exploited and their wealth is extracted via imperialism. In order to sustain imperialism without protest back home, it’s important to sell the idea to your own citizens in USA/CANZUK that they’re superior and the people you’re exploiting/oppressing (Filipinos in this case) are subhuman. Next, if you feed Filipinos propaganda that they are ugly for 350 years, they’ll start to believe it. Tell them their noses are flat and their eyes are too small and that their skin is too dark. Make half white/Filipino people over-represented in media (e.g miss universe). Prey on these insecurities by pushing plastic surgery like rhinoplasty, double eyelid surgery, and skin whitening products.  Hypersexualise the women and emasculate the men. Tell them meritocracy is real, and that they’re poor because they’re not trying hard enough. Sell them a promise of a better future if they immigrate abroad to wealthier countries like USA. Tell them that if you marry a white person, they’ll have a beautiful halfie child with a tall nose and pale skin and big eyes. Now the new Filipino immigrants will proclaim how proud they are to be American and have escaped their poor motherland. Now the cycle of self-hate is complete.

Combine this with a subsection of white men who 1.) believe the propaganda that they’re exceptional by virtue of being American/white 2.) are awkward with poor social skills and poor dating history 3.) happy with an uneven power differential in the relationship 4.) questionably racist or unaware of racial dynamics (usually self-proclaim they don’t see colour) 5. Potentially aware of the above racial dynamics, and are happy to exploit them

You’ll see the same examples play out in other colonies - e.g Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.

This self-hate is the same reason you’ll see a Filipino open up an ancestry test and get disappointed they didn’t have any Spanish blood in them.

Interesting example - Derek Chauvin’s wife is also Asian.

And there you have it, the recipe for white worship, self-hate, and why you see so many White men like Jonathon Ross are married to Asian women. **And capitalism/imperialism is ultimately the root of all of this.**

Edit: not sure why there are so many downvotes… I thought other Marxists would find this interesting

Colonised by Spain for 300 years, and then colonised by USA for 50 years. Their labour is exploited and their wealth is extracted via imperialism. In order to sustain imperialism without protest back home, it’s important to sell the idea to your own citizens in USA/CANZUK that they’re superior and the people you’re exploiting/oppressing (Filipinos in this case) are subhuman. Next, if you feed Filipinos propaganda that they are ugly for 350 years, they’ll start to believe it. Tell them their noses are flat and their eyes are too small and that their skin is too dark. Make half white/Filipino people over-represented in media (e.g miss universe). Prey on these insecurities by pushing plastic surgery like rhinoplasty, double eyelid surgery, and skin whitening products.  Hypersexualise the women and emasculate the men.

35,Indian Flags should be mandatory.,1q919e7,youthforIndia,1,0,2026-01-10 10:55:52,upForIndia,"I believe that everything on Indian land—be it schools, religious institutions, public vehicles, private vehicles, private institutions, grounds, party offices, cafés, clubs, or any public or social gathering place—must either hoist the Indian flag or display it in a framed and clearly visible manner. One may collectively hoist the flag or display it individually, but acknowledgment of the land on which one stands must be non-negotiable.

This principle should extend to all forms of social gatherings, whether peaceful protests, rallies, roadshows, or festival celebrations. Any such gathering should have a clearly visible Indian flag, with limited exceptions permitted only through official police authorization or for specific rituals such as mourning.

The flags should be governed, standardized, and officially provided or approved by the Government of India, along with clear policies to ensure respectful handling. The government should define minimum frame and flag dimensions. While individuals or institutions may choose larger sizes, any distortion, alteration, or modification of the flag must not be tolerated.

These flags can be distributed through local government offices and manufactured in India by Indian craftsmen, thereby reinforcing both national respect and local employment.

The government should impose strict legal consequences on anyone who deliberately defies this mandate, as such refusal would amount to a denial of acknowledgment of the nation and could promote anti-national sentiment.

At the same time, the law must explicitly state that citizens who observe violations should report them only to the police or through designated digital platforms. No form of mob action or vigilantism must be permitted. Strict action should be taken against any mob violence or misuse of this mandate as a weapon against others. If enforcement creates fear among citizens, then the system itself has failed.

This proposal is not about coercion or hostility, but about collective acknowledgment of the nation we inhabit.

I’m a fresher working at a private IT company in India. I joined around 45 days ago and am currently under a 6-month probation period.

At the time of joining, I signed a separate service/bond agreement requiring 2 years of service, with a bond amount of ₹2,00,000 if I leave early (described as training cost). So far, the training has been mostly internal and generic.

After joining, I’ve realized that I do not want to continue in the corporate sector and would like to exit early in a clean and professional manner, without misconduct or disputes.

My appointment letter states that employment during probation is performance-based and can be terminated by either side as per policy.

Additionally, the company is currently holding my original educational documents submitted at the time of joining.

I would appreciate advice on:
	1.	How enforceable such bonds are in India, especially at an early stage like 45 days
	2.	Whether seeking a mutual separation during probation is usually a safer approach
	3.	The legality of retaining original educational certificates
	4.	Any practical steps to minimize future issues (background verification, government jobs, etc.)

There are no criminal issues, no misrepresentation, and no intention to abscond. I’m only looking for a lawful and professional exit.

Thank you in advance.

39,The reality of India we don’t often notice,1q9sbxd,TwentiesIndia,1,1,2026-01-11 06:39:13,Infamous-Hawk-13,"I had a road accident and I was taken to a government hospital. There I was in a general ward with 20-30 other patients, that room was full of pain and suffering, everyone there was in immense pain. There was constant screams in that room, some of those screams were nerve wracking. But what caught my attention was a girl aged between 13 and 16, pleading to the head doctor there. She had brought his grandfather along with her who was on a stretcher waiting to be treated. Looking at her pleading, I as well as the head doctor thought she is pleading for a speedy treatment of her grandfather. The head doctor tried to console her that her grandfather would be treated and he would be fine then. She then said that she is very hungry and wants something to eat. The doctor was clearly moved by her state and asked the nurses to arrange some food for her. By the time nurses arranged the food for her, an attendant to a different patient gave her something to eat. Seeing all this unfold in front of me, I thought of the contrasting wealth conditions among different sections of people in India. We often are surrounded by people in similar financial condition and don’t realise that there is a large section in India who are barely able to feed them  and it almost impossible for them to get treatment in a private hospital.

I will also like to tell one more incident which is very contrasting to the above one. I had gone to a very high end restaurant in Pune and alcohol was being served there. There I noticed a birthday being celebrated in a part of the restaurant. The decorations wrote on wall “Happy 16th Birthday”. The birthday girl was wearing a sparkling golden dress, all the boys wore black and all the girls wore white. They were around 20-30 people. Looking at them I wondered I never got a chance to celebrate my birthday like that and theirs world is very different from mine. I have fought to get everything that I have, whereas all of them have parents who can give them everything I dream of.

But witnessing these two incidents unfold in front of me I realised I should be more thankful for the opportunities I got. We have to make the most of the opportunities that we get, but we don’t often control the opportunities that we get. We often don’t acknowledge the importance of luck in our life. Also we should be more empathetic towards people around us who didn’t get the same opportunities that we got.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1q9sbxd/the_reality_of_india_we_dont_often_notice/,"The reality of India we don’t often notice 1 I had a road accident and I was taken to a government hospital.

41,Shaming for taking on debt X Business,1q9s1zl,personalfinanceindia,2,0,2026-01-11 06:23:40,yachan96,"Lets say you are a regular joe and want to start a business and you don't have capital, You take up a loan from offline lenders who thinks they are doing charity by lending at 2-3 rs per month which is 24-36% , and some of these sharks charge interests upto 10rs per month and there are places where they lend 850 rs in the morning and collect 1000 in the night. lets say you fail in the business with this 2-3rs debt tied to you, as a society we can choose to ignore because we are not involved in the contract.   
  
However,  why does society often choose to blame the borrower? Calling the borrower names like he lived a show off life hence the debt and what not. When we as society fail to call out and put the same level of shame on the loan sharks' usurious activities? If we are talking about legality, loan sharks don't have NBFC licenses, if we are talking about morality, regular joe took a risk on business and lost, loan shark took a risk in lending business and lost ? ( I am not taking about willful defaults.)

Society should either participate fully and shame the loan sharks who charge exorbitantly and exploit people and also shame the defaulting borrowers or stay silent, but when society participates only one side, this just stops people from doing businesses that offer goods/services and instead encourage them to just exploit people in the name of lending.  

Government actually does a good job in this regard, there are regulations on lending and collection practices and also gives the rights to lenders to liquidate assets of borrowers when it goes there, society/people should also evolve to this level to keep the entrepreneurship spirit alive.   
  
Don't make straw man arguments. Willful defaults are not the topic of this discussion. I made this post after reading comments on another post that were blaming the op in the name of offering an advice.

Please Help.,1q9rtlw,LegalAdviceIndia,0,8,2026-01-11 06:10:46,SocietyNecessary4343,"I am an IT professional from Maharashtra, the sole earner for my family. I am currently in a panic state (unable to eat/sleep) because my bank account was frozen by the Delhi Special Cell regarding a disputed transaction of ₹7,200. I cannot tell my parents as they have severe health issues.
The Core Issue:
The authorities claim a specific transaction of ₹7,200 is the cause of the fraud complaint. However, this money was never credited to my bank account. I tried to withdraw it from a gaming site, it failed, and the site refunded it back to my gaming wallet—it never hit my bank. My bank statement proves I never received this money, yet my account is frozen for it.
Timeline of Events:
Nov 2025: Started playing online games. Made 3-4 successful withdrawals previously.
5th Dec 2025: Initiated a withdrawal of ₹7,200. It failed.
7th Dec 2025: The gaming app refunded the amount back to my gaming wallet (not bank).
20th-26th Dec 2025: Received message that bank account is frozen by Delhi Special Cell (IFSO).

2nd Jan 2026: Received RTI reply via email confirming an FIR exists.
4th Jan 2026: Received an SMS from India Post that an article has been booked from the same location as the RTI office.
My Current Anxiety:
I received a notification that a Speed Post is on its way from the same location where I got the RTI reply. It has been in transit for 4 days.
I am terrified: Is this just the physical copy of the RTI reply? Or is it a Section 41A Notice/Summons/Arrest Warrant?
Constraints:
I live in Maharashtra; the investigation is in Delhi.
I have emailed the department multiple times with no response.
I have proof (bank statements) showing the money never entered my account.
I stopped gambling immediately after the freeze.
Questions for the Community:
Given that the Speed Post was booked right after the RTI reply, is it likely just the hard copy of the RTI?
If it is a police notice, how do I handle this from Maharashtra without traveling to Delhi immediately?
How can I unfreeze my account if the disputed amount was never actually credited to me?
Do I need a lawyer immediately?

46,ITC Lost ₹70K Crore in 2 Days - Here's Why This Isn't a Buy-the-Dip Opportunity Yet,1q9rewd,IndianStockDaily,5,1,2026-01-11 05:49:40,Muted-Basis-6687,"**TL;DR:** ITC lost ₹70,000 crore in market cap after new tobacco taxes were announced. While it recovered from a similar 2017 crash, this time the tax structure is fundamentally different-giving the government a ""fast-forward button"" to change taxes anytime. Cigarettes still drive 60% of ITC's profits, and analysts have cut earnings estimates by 15%. Not a buying opportunity yet.​​

# What Just Happened?

Within 2 trading days, tobacco stocks got hammered:​

* **ITC**: Down 15%
* **Godfrey Phillips**: Down 19%
* **Total destruction**: ₹70,000 crore wiped out

The trigger? The government announced massive tax hikes effective **February 1, 2026**:​

* GST jumps from 28% → **40%**
* New excise duty: **₹2,050 to ₹8,500 per 1,000 cigarettes** (based on length)
* The old compensation cess structure was completely removed

# Didn't This Happen in 2017 Too?

**Yes, but here's the critical difference:**

**2017 Playbook**

* ITC fell 15% when GST was introduced
* Company raised prices 4-8%
* Maintained margins at 34-39%
* Net profit grew from ₹10,477 cr → ₹35,351 cr by FY26
* Stock eventually **doubled** by July 2023​

**2026 Reality**

**Back then:** Tax changes needed GST Council approval (slow, predictable)  
**Now:** Government can change excise duty via simple notification—**no council approval needed**​​

Think of it like this:

* **2017**: Turning a big wheel (slow, visible, gives time to adjust)
* **2026**: Flipping a switch (instant, unpredictable, ongoing threat)

The new excise duty is charged **at the factory gate** as a fixed rupee cost, not a percentage. This means:​

* Immediate cost impact
* Can't be absorbed through discounts or pricing tricks
* Forces direct price hikes to consumers

# The Math

To protect margins with a 50% tax increase, companies need to raise prices by **\~40%**.​​

In a price-sensitive market like India, that's playing with fire 🔥:

* **Option 1**: Raise prices aggressively → Kill volume
* **Option 2**: Keep prices stable → Margins collapse
* **Option 3**: Raise prices moderately → Both volume AND margins suffer

Historical pattern: When cigarette prices spike, consumers either:

1. **Down-trade** to cheaper brands
2. Switch to **illegal channels** (permanent market share loss)

#  ITC's Business Reality Check

**The Strong Stuff**

* Market cap: ₹4.38 lakh crore
* ROE: \~27% | ROCE: \~37%
* Dividend yield: \~4% (₹14.35/share in FY25)
* Operating cash flows: ₹17,000+ crore annually​

**The Uncomfortable Truth**

**Cigarettes = 59% profit margins and majority of cash flows**  
Everything else is struggling:​

* Paper/Packaging: Pressured by cheap imports
* FMCG: 9-10% margins (suboptimal)
* Agri: Flat/degrowth
* Hotels: Already demerged

**Translation:** Diversification looks good on paper, but cigarettes still pay the bills.

# Who's Holding And Who's Selling?

ITC has **zero promoter holding**—it's professionally managed.​

**Ownership breakdown:**

* Domestic institutions: 47.4% (LIC leads with \~20%)
* Foreign institutions: 37.4%
* British American Tobacco: 17.79% (down from 24.01% in Dec 2022)

**Interesting move:** Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (strict value investors) **increased** holdings from 1.01% → 1.17% in latest quarter. They only add when comfortable with value.​

But BAT has been consistently reducing stake. Their May 2024 sale of 2.5% caused a single-day 4% drop.​

# What Analysts Are Saying

**Jefferies**

* Cut earnings estimates by **15%**
* Cites ""weaker volumes + poor near-term visibility""
* Companies need 15-40% price hikes​​

**ICICI Securities**

* Cost increase of 22-28% for 75-85mm cigarettes (16% of ITC volumes)
* Requires ₹2-3 per stick price hikes​​

**Others**

* FY27 cigarette volumes: **13% lower** vs pre-tax estimates
* FY28 volumes: **13.6% lower**
* Revenue cut: 5.1% for FY27​

#  So... Buy the Dip?

**What's Changed** 

* The regulatory framework is now **unpredictable**
* Near-term earnings visibility = zero
* Policy risk is a **permanent feature**, not a one-time event

**What Hasn't Changed**

* Cigarette demand remains relatively inelastic (addiction dynamics)
* ITC dominates the legal cigarette market
* Strong cash flows support dividends

**The Verdict**

**This isn't a ""buy the dip"" moment yet.**​

Wait for:

1. Price stabilization and consolidation pattern
2. Clarity on how much price hike consumers will absorb
3. Q4 FY26 results (post-tax implementation)

* FY27 cigarette volumes: **13% lower** vs pre-tax estimates
* FY28 volumes: **13.6% lower**
* Revenue cut: 5.1% for FY27​

#  So... Buy the Dip?

**What's Changed** 

* The regulatory framework is now **unpredictable**
* Near-term earnings visibility = zero
* Policy risk is a **permanent feature**, not a one-time event

**What Hasn't Changed**

* Cigarette demand remains relatively inelastic (addiction dynamics)
* ITC dominates the legal cigarette market
* Strong cash flows support dividends

**The Verdict**

**This isn't a ""buy the dip"" moment yet.**​

Wait for:

1. Price stabilization and consolidation pattern
2. Clarity on how much price hike consumers will absorb
3. Q4 FY26 results (post-tax implementation)

48,"Dm makes us play D&D, but don't know the rules... For 6+ years of making us play!",1q9r9be,CritCrab,0,1,2026-01-11 05:41:36,Embarrassed-Film9680,"Ho boy, if you think that's a weird title, you're in for a treat...

Before i begin this long rent, I know, I know, no D&D is better than bad D&D, but where i live, either you learn to play with friend, or you played for more 15 year prior and join a group. Few groups accept new player and TTRPG's have only begin to be popular for a mere 15 to 20 years. 

For context, I'm French, bonsoir, sorry in advance if there is thing you don't understand, english is not my first language and it's currently 6:40 am. I'm 26 and i learn 5e rules through the course of the last 6 years. I don't claim to be an expert, or particularly anything related to the game itself as i tend to think that D&D is a game complex enough that you keep learning through the time playing it. My experience is a bit off, because i played with the same group for this period of time, but i'm curious enough to look around, read and learn because i like the game and i want to have more fun playing it. I started, like plenty of us, during the pandemic lock down in France. We started with five player and the DM, it was our first introduction to the game, and i learn many things during this one. I wont talk about it here, even if it's relevant, because it'll be too long. The only things relevant to be said are:

\- it was a first for plenty of people there

\- it was fun being ignorant

\- it wasn't balanced

\- and it died for more reasons than some people wants to admit

  
So, this story start around May 2023. The protagonist are Dm, the bard, the wizard, the goblin and me. Everyone should be referenced as that in the story, only the goblin in the group doesn't come from the previous campaign, but he know pretty much what happened and still came knowingly. (PS: don't worry, nothing like a creepy guy or anything like this)

So, DM post a plot of his homebrew campaign, a Pangea type world, where 67 years prior to our time, multiple plain of existence collapsed for a instant. Monsters and other aberrations came and wrecked things, order came back not without difficulties, and the church of Tyre began to expend it's domain. 66 years later, a cultist organization using the influence and resources from the church of Tyre came forth, claiming that witchery and magic were the cause of our demise, and that every magical races/species were to doom us all. That only Humans had the right to exist.

If you asked me at the time, i was a bit hyped, if a game like D&D, fighting a cult that is against magic and ""exotic"" species could be cool, especially  if we where to work for a government or something like that. Well... First session then, no session 0 for you, and for us... We had to create our character prior to that, and to create a backstory long enough, with ""someone we lost"" because of the cult. Not dead, not particularly, just lost. So, we did, goblin (a monk) lost his tribe while outside his camp, bard who played a eladrin druid at that time, and wizard who was a fairy where ""sisters"" and lost there mentor, and i played a human blood hunter, and i had lost my first born years prior for the church of Tyre. We where all in a tavern (obviously) for random reasons, not knowing each others, when the cult's soldiers came and escorted vigorously a vendor out of town. Barman asked us to save the guy, because he helped guys like us flee the cult's hunt. We went on, and on the road to do so, we where ambushed by thugs. 10 of them. ""Thrusting"" the DM on that (he actually did said ""thrust me"") Wizard cast magnify gravity, high roll damage, we happy, every thugs saved, we not happy. hence initiative, every thugs come first. Goblin down, me down, druid down. We waited for a divine intervention, a mighty DMPC, anything ? Wizard flew, and cheesed the fight with firebolts while we waited... Druid (bard) died from death saves, no divine intervention, we looked at DM through discord cam, asked what happened, smiled, and said, ""you played it bad, you died, end of the story, 3 of you are still alive so it's all good, bard you need to reroll."" 

This, is not the end of session 1, we killed 2 soldier's, freed the guy, escorted him to a mage who teleported him away, found the cult nearby small camp, fight the guards with 3 of us (it was a better fight) and the end of session. Bard did not play for more than half the session... We where LvL 1 if you asked, so we asked how we where supposed to do the fight, apparently we didn't need to fight them, we just needed to give our gold, our equipment, and wizard's book of spell. Spell focus included. That gave the tone. Session 2, Bard come's with Bard half elf, no story 'cause it's the next day. The ""small camp"" is a dungeon, where we spend 3 days, fight nearly 30 cultist, all of them wearing 19 AC armor, while i have a 15 AC with a leather armor and no mastery for heavy armor. Then, boss fight, 21 AC, every attack is a crit, plus if he hit you, you are pushed in the direction he choose, so he push me against a wall, so he double his damages and on top, it's a nat 20. needless to say, from the top of my lvl 3, i died, Goblin died, wizard is unkillable  because he fly, but unwilling to fight because her sister died 2 days earlier, and 2 more just now, bard flee and killed the guy after 20 rounds. That's when DM divined intervention came, Wizard found a portal, found some type of god in there, asked that we revive, the guy revive us, nothing more, we are back... We finished to clear the dungeon, and there is nothing relevant here. The god just vanished after reviving us, said nothing more, the portal too, we have no quest, no lead, no nothing, and bard is kind of pissed that we where brought back where he wasn't.

I wont make it session after session at this point, because you have the flow, point is, i played my character at that time as the lead, because bard and goblin just wanted to go with the flow, and wizard lack the will to live. So I decided with the lack of better things to do, to escort wizard to her lost mentor for witch we found a trace, and then just take my leave (in character) because she lacked interest in dying again for nothing. We did go on this adventure, when in a tavern, a shady woman asked our group to help a city with the cult's occupation. The city was in our direction, and started to decline in character for multiple reasons, the first being we where not a group of heroes (i'm a mercenary, goblin is a goblin, bard is a pirate and fairy don't actually care for good reasons) but she just pops open a portal saying we will be rewarded with plenty gold. There, we talked with the mayor, 500 gold for each, and he will present us an important rebellion member! As players we are happy to ear it, as character too, for different reasons. We free the city, saved by a weird wizard that just annihilated the camp for us with a shower of fireballs, and we slept for 3 days. Why ? because DM said so, when we woke up, gold for everyone, that's it, we get teleported back where we came from. The rebel intel ? she didn't wanted to wait for us so she moved out, with a portal.

  
We took, the side quest, i guess we had gold now, great, cant wait to buy prohibited magic item then. Next town, hidden in a forest, a last refuge for magical creature and spell caster's. A good place for it ! No. No one sales anything, not even the old wizard got any spell to share to ours. And the goblin and i loose everything over a night because we drank. I guess being a blood hunter helps a lot to drink for 500 gold worth of cheap alcohol. As for the goblin, he drunkenly paid for a bronze stat of him in the village, built overnight. Side quest took 2 sessions, hidden village, barely half of one.

Fast forward, we search a ruined magic school, with rooms following one another, like a straight, straight line, for 6 sessions, 12 fights, no items, few info, and finally the mentor. everyone flee, because the area is being destroyed by a mountain sized centipede fighting a mountain sized white dracolich that was sleeping nearby.

Fairy wizard is replaced with mentor wizard (human), and i switch my blood hunter for a high elf Hexeblade warlock, that i play like a paladin. We both rerolled to better fit in our mind the campain, righting better story, with one on one session with the DM to learn thing that might help us get the game moving. Meanwhile, bard don't have a story. 

At this point i don't know if this is relevant that I story-tell our campaign. I'm not a good narrator and i tend to loose myself.   
Fights for the most of them, where hard, i think not the good kind of hard, multiple time Goblin and I, being the only melee character, were downed, bard was forced to player the healer type, and wizard had a hard time casting anything because of the wide opens area and the too spread out's enemies. And that's when we fought ""normal"" enemies (meaning soldier type, with bows or swords and 19 ac global) when we fought bosses, theses tends to had ""abilities"" not like a simple innate spell casting or a charm/fear or anything like this. No, abilities like ""this dude use his blood to cast an aoe on this tiny arena with no covert, plus he takes half damage of any type because he is like a pool of blood, and every spell he cast is not a spell because it's different from magic"". We had a fight like this one, 2 actually, not good fights.   
Later in the story, we found the famous intel, we followed everything she asked of us, went to an ""inaccessible and deserted island"" with plenty of cultist on it. Searched for a thing we didn't need, found Bard's story (after a year playing her), found a npc trapped in a thing... i legit don't know how to explain it. We fled the isle, our road pointed toward my pc's kingdom (long story shorts: she is the illegitimate daughter of the king on a road to revenge for the princess's death and prince's curse from the cult). It's been like less than 3 month that pc left, but the kingdom is controlled by the cult. I know country can fall faster than that in the real world but i don't follow the logic where a cult against any magic and magic species is left free of taking total control of a kingdom ruled by High elves, and where multiple non human species live in peace. But, what ever, we take care of it, telling ourselves that it's just a matter of a few 3 to 5 sessions and a few in game time ""weeks"" to free it, even if a ""bastard"" my pc still has some kind of authority after all.  
12 sessions. No authority, every ""leader"" and ""help"" has been pulled apart. The king is controlled, and cursed. We do what we need to do, freeing the kingdom at last, not without freeing the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse while doing so, and not without freeing a red haired women, cursed with rot and probably going on a rampage while we speak. Ha and story wise, my character is being hunted by a priestess of Tyamat, because my patron, my sword is a fragment of the later, gone rogue (PC's knows that), and wizard is being hunted by an old all powerfull pyromancer ex friend of his because why not, apparently the same one that broke the world 67 year prior and caused all of this. 

That's a lot, i guess, the story matters, but that's not the point of the title, the game continues beyond that but not for long. It still run, i think, at least nobody asked to stop it.

This game has problem, and multiple times we put a stop to discuss with the DM to better things up. Sometimes he took it the wrong way, sometimes not. Every time he said he'll do something about it. Until the third time, where i asked if he knew what our character could. His simple answer: ""bard heal, wizard cast things, goblin hit, and you too""  
like that, nothing else added. I asked him if he knew what spell could bard and wizard cast, no answer. What goblin can do with his fist ? ""hit people ?"". I didn't bother ask for myself, being an exotic class he wouldn't know. That's the first time we ask, with the goblin, that he take the time to ""read"" our characters sheet, and read the PHB of our classes. He said he would, and he did, 3 session later, wizard found spell scrolls to right in his book. 5 later, while infiltrating a castle as quickly as possible, he found another, on a wall, a 3rd lvl spell (6h to copy). He didn't read the ""rules"", he just barely remembered what we told him. 

He does not know the rules, i knew that already, but when we started the game i told him that i would play only if he learned, because our previous game was a joke and i didn't wanted it to be the same. We, with the goblin, put a stop to this actual campaign 5 times already, asking him to learn, or at least to ask us, because we were both rule lawyers. I don't know all of them, but i sure do know them better than DM. Never once he came. The monster we fight use an ""ability"", with goblin we summaries that's its an actual spell. He ""create"" an item that he asked chat gpt to build ? the item given to a party lvl 7 is categorized has legendary in our own good sense, hence we denies it. This dude get up, spell vamp 2 guys, heal 2 guys, transform, and attack the 4 of us, in one turn ? Sorry but DM, no, there has been a bit too many actions on the round just for this guy... the same dude cast a spell, not spell, so no counter spell, on my PC, i make a save, fail, nothing happened. Dude is hit, i take the full damage, i hit myself, i take the damage, how do i counter it ? No one knows, not even DM apparently, because when we asked him, he said you can't. so i guess my pc will just wait to be down so we can play this fight. 

I played 6 years with this DM, I learned to play D&D, not with him, but FOR him, this is the second campaign i do with him has a DM. If you asked why am i still here, i honestly don't know myself. But i invested some much in it that it hurts me to leave. But, as time passes, me and goblin pounder the saying. This campaign, is truly a much, much better version of the previous one. The Roll play isn't always great, but it's there, there too many goofy npc if you ask us, but we can't go against them. The story has it's flaws, but it's not bad and i definitely cant narrate it well enough. He is a good story teller, but sometimes i think he forget that we are the main characters in his story and that we have a right to choose our characters path. He tends to push us to play something we don't want to play, like bard being stuck a healer, even though  he want to be useful in other ways, but by the DM his character is not fit for RP. Unlike Goblin, the monk, who was the actual face of the party for most of the time, pushed up by DM. Plenty of thing like that, taken out of context, and lived through the year are infuriating.

I don't really know how to end this, so if you have any question, please ask away, i'll gladly answer you, i'll try to tell Goblin to add up too. Thank's for reading it, and for the other here is it:

Unlike Goblin, the monk, who was the actual face of the party for most of the time, pushed up by DM. Plenty of thing like that, taken out of context, and lived through the year are infuriating.

I don't really know how to end this, so if you have any question, please ask away, i'll gladly answer you, i'll try to tell Goblin to add up too. Thank's for reading it, and for the other here is it:

TLDR: DM drag us long in a campaign, we play by the rules, but he don't know half of them, and that's just a part of the problem.",dm makes us play d d but don t know the rules for years of making us play ho boy if you think that s a weird title you re in for a treat before i begin this long rent i know i know no d d is better than bad d d but where i live either you learn to play with friend or you played for more year prior and join a group few groups accept new player and ttrpg s have only begin to be popular for a mere to years for context i m french bonsoir sorry in advance if there is thing you don t understand english is not my first language and it s currently am i m and i learn e rules through the course of the last years i don t claim to be an expert or particularly anything related to the game itself as i tend to think that d d is a game complex enough that you keep learning through the time playing it my experience is a bit off because i played with the same group for this period of time but i m curious enough to look around read and learn because i like the game and i want to have more fun playing it i started like plenty of us during the pandemic lock down in france we started with five player and the dm it was our first introduction to the game and i learn many things during this one i wont talk about it here even if it s relevant because it ll be too long the only things relevant to be said are it was a first for plenty of people there it was fun being ignorant it wasn t balanced and it died for more reasons than some people wants to admit so this story start around may the protagonist are dm the bard the wizard the goblin and me everyone should be referenced as that in the story only the goblin in the group doesn t come from the previous campaign but he know pretty much what happened and still came knowingly ps don t worry nothing like a creepy guy or anything like this so dm post a plot of his homebrew campaign a pangea type world where years prior to our time multiple plain of existence collapsed for a instant monsters and other aberrations came and wrecked things order came back not without difficulties and the church of tyre began to expend it s domain years later a cultist organization using the influence and resources from the church of tyre came forth claiming that witchery and magic were the cause of our demise and that every magical races species were to doom us all that only humans had the right to exist if you asked me at the time i was a bit hyped if a game like d d fighting a cult that is against magic and exotic species could be cool especially if we where to work for a government or something like that well first session then no session for you and for us we had to create our character prior to that and to create a backstory long enough with someone we lost because of the cult not dead not particularly just lost so we did goblin a monk lost his tribe while outside his camp bard who played a eladrin druid at that time and wizard who was a fairy where sisters and lost there mentor and i played a human blood hunter and i had lost my first born years prior for the church of tyre we where all in a tavern obviously for random reasons not knowing each others when the cult s soldiers came and escorted vigorously a vendor out of town barman asked us to save the guy because he helped guys like us flee the cult s hunt we went on and on the road to do so we where ambushed by thugs of them thrusting the dm on that he actually did said thrust me wizard cast magnify gravity high roll damage we happy every thugs saved we not happy hence initiative every thugs come first goblin down me down druid down we waited for a divine intervention a mighty dmpc anything wizard flew and cheesed the fight with firebolts while we waited druid bard died from death saves no divine intervention we looked at dm through discord cam asked what happened smiled and said you played it bad you died end of the story of you are still alive so it s all good bard you need to reroll this is not the end of session we killed soldier s freed the guy escorted him to a mage who teleported him away found the cult nearby small camp fight the guards with of us it was a better fight and the end of session bard did not play for more than half the session we where lvl if you asked so we asked how we where supposed to do the fight apparently we didn t need to fight them we just needed to give our gold our equipment and wizard s book of spell spell focus included that gave the tone session bard come s with bard half elf no story cause it s the next day the small camp is a dungeon where we spend days fight nearly cultist all of them wearing ac armor while i have a ac with a leather armor and no mastery for heavy armor then boss fight ac every attack is a crit plus if he hit you you are pushed in the direction he choose so he push me against a wall so he double his damages and on top it s a nat needless to say from the top of my lvl i died goblin died wizard is unkillable because he fly but unwilling to fight because her sister died days earlier and more just now bard flee and killed the guy after rounds that s when dm divined intervention came wizard found a portal found some type of god in there asked that we revive the guy revive us nothing more we are back we finished to clear the dungeon and there is nothing relevant here the god just vanished after reviving us said nothing more the portal too we have no quest no lead no nothing and bard is kind of pissed that we where brought back where he wasn t i wont make it session after session at this point because you have the flow point is i played my character at that time as the lead because bard and goblin just wanted to go with the flow and wizard lack the will to live so i decided with the lack of better things to do to escort wizard to her lost mentor for witch we found a trace and then just take my leave in character because she lacked interest in dying again for nothing we did go on this adventure when in a tavern a shady woman asked our group to help a city with the cult s occupation the city was in our direction and started to decline in character for multiple reasons the first being we where not a group of heroes i m a mercenary goblin is a goblin bard is a pirate and fairy don t actually care for good reasons but she just pops open a portal saying we will be rewarded with plenty gold there we talked with the mayor gold for each and he will present us an important rebellion member as players we are happy to ear it as character too for different reasons we free the city saved by a weird wizard that just annihilated the camp for us with a shower of fireballs and we slept for days why because dm said so when we woke up gold for everyone that s it we get teleported back where we came from the rebel intel she didn t wanted to wait for us so she moved out with a portal we took the side quest i guess we had gold now great cant wait to buy prohibited magic item then next town hidden in a forest a last refuge for magical creature and spell caster s a good place for it no no one sales anything not even the old wizard got any spell to share to ours and the goblin and i loose everything over a night because we drank i guess being a blood hunter helps a lot to drink for gold worth of cheap alcohol as for the goblin he drunkenly paid for a bronze stat of him in the village built overnight side quest took sessions hidden village barely half of one fast forward we search a ruined magic school with rooms following one another like a straight straight line for sessions fights no items few info and finally the mentor everyone flee because the area is being destroyed by a mountain sized centipede fighting a mountain sized white dracolich that was sleeping nearby fairy wizard is replaced with mentor wizard human and i switch my blood hunter for a high elf hexeblade warlock that i play like a paladin we both rerolled to better fit in our mind the campain righting better story with one on one session with the dm to learn thing that might help us get the game moving meanwhile bard don t have a story at this point i don t know if this is relevant that i story tell our campaign i m not a good narrator and i tend to loose myself fights for the most of them where hard i think not the good kind of hard multiple time goblin and i being the only melee character were downed bard was forced to player the healer type and wizard had a hard time casting anything because of the wide opens area and the too spread out s enemies and that s when we fought normal enemies meaning soldier type with bows or swords and ac global when we fought bosses theses tends to had abilities not like a simple innate spell casting or a charm fear or anything like this no abilities like this dude use his blood to cast an aoe on this tiny arena with no covert plus he takes half damage of any type because he is like a pool of blood and every spell he cast is not a spell because it s different from magic we had a fight like this one actually not good fights later in the story we found the famous intel we followed everything she asked of us went to an inaccessible and deserted island with plenty of cultist on it searched for a thing we didn t need found bard s story after a year playing her found a npc trapped in a thing i legit don t know how to explain it we fled the isle our road pointed toward my pc s kingdom long story shorts she is the illegitimate daughter of the king on a road to revenge for the princess s death and prince s curse from the cult it s been like less than month that pc left but the kingdom is controlled by the cult i know country can fall faster than that in the real world but i don t follow the logic where a cult against any magic and magic species is left free of taking total control of a kingdom ruled by high elves and where multiple non human species live in peace but what ever we take care of it telling ourselves that it s just a matter of a few to sessions and a few in game time weeks to free it even if a bastard my pc still has some kind of authority after all sessions no authority every leader and help has been pulled apart the king is controlled and cursed we do what we need to do freeing the kingdom at last not without freeing the horsemen of the apocalypse while doing so and not without freeing a red haired women cursed with rot and probably going on a rampage while we speak ha and story wise my character is being hunted by a priestess of tyamat because my patron my sword is a fragment of the later gone rogue pc s knows that and wizard is being hunted by an old all powerfull pyromancer ex friend of his because why not apparently the same one that broke the world year prior and caused all of this that s a lot i guess the story matters but that s not the point of the title the game continues beyond that but not for long it still run i think at least nobody asked to stop it this game has problem and multiple times we put a stop to discuss with the dm to better things up sometimes he took it the wrong way sometimes not every time he said he ll do something about it until the third time where i asked if he knew what our character could his simple answer bard heal wizard cast things goblin hit and you too like that nothing else added i asked him if he knew what spell could bard and wizard cast no answer what goblin can do with his fist hit people i didn t bother ask for myself being an exotic class he wouldn t know that s the first time we ask with the goblin that he take the time to read our characters sheet and read the phb of our classes he said he would and he did session later wizard found spell scrolls to right in his book later while infiltrating a castle as quickly as possible he found another on a wall a rd lvl spell h to copy he didn t read the rules he just barely remembered what we told him he does not know the rules i knew that already but when we started the game i told him that i would play only if he learned because our previous game was a joke and i didn t wanted it to be the same we with the goblin put a stop to this actual campaign times already asking him to learn or at least to ask us because we were both rule lawyers i don t know all of them but i sure do know them better than dm never once he came the monster we fight use an ability with goblin we summaries that s its an actual spell he create an item that he asked chat gpt to build the item given to a party lvl is categorized has legendary in our own good sense hence we denies it this dude get up spell vamp guys heal guys transform and attack the of us in one turn sorry but dm no there has been a bit too many actions on the round just for this guy the same dude cast a spell not spell so no counter spell on my pc i make a save fail nothing happened dude is hit i take the full damage i hit myself i take the damage how do i counter it no one knows not even dm apparently because when we asked him he said you can t so i guess my pc will just wait to be down so we can play this fight i played years with this dm i learned to play d d not with him but for him this is the second campaign i do with him has a dm if you asked why am i still here i honestly don t know myself but i invested some much in it that it hurts me to leave but as time passes me and goblin pounder the saying this campaign is truly a much much better version of the previous one the roll play isn t always great but it s there there too many goofy npc if you ask us but we can t go against them the story has it s flaws but it s not bad and i definitely cant narrate it well enough he is a good story teller but sometimes i think he forget that we are the main characters in his story and that we have a right to choose our characters path he tends to push us to play something we don t want to play like bard being stuck a healer

**The Incident**

The Bangalore fog hung heavy over the Nandi Hills viewpoint in January 2026. A black sedan had sailed off the cliff edge at 2:00 AM. There were no skid marks and no witnesses. The coroner’s report was brief: ""Natural causes leading to accidental death."" The driver’s heart had simply stopped a second before the plunge.

**The Analyst**

Sub-Inspector Arjun was ready to close the file until **Rohan**, a Data Analytics student from IISc, walked into the station. Rohan wasn't a detective; he was a researcher studying **Cross-State Judicial Conviction Rates**.

""I found a glitch in the data, Sir,"" Rohan said, sliding a tablet across the desk. ""Two years ago, a luxury SUV mowed down three street sleepers in Bangalore. The driver was a powerful politician’s son. He was acquitted despite overwhelming evidence. The prosecutor was a legendary lawyer named **Advocate Iyer**.""

**The Pattern**

Rohan’s heat maps showed something impossible. Every person involved in that acquittal—the hostile witness, the forensic expert who 'lost' the blood samples, and the driver himself—had died in ""natural"" accidents across different states in the last six months.

Arjun tried to find the original victims to see if a relative was seeking revenge. He hit a dead end. ""The victims were nameless street dwellers,"" Arjun noted. ""No families, no addresses. Only the Government had prosecuted the case. They were ghosts.""

**The Suspect**

Arjun asked Rohan to run the analysis on *all* of Advocate Iyer’s successful acquittals. The results were chilling. Across India, criminals who had been ""wrongfully"" let go by Iyer’s brilliance were dying in a sequence of perfectly timed natural accidents.

""It’s Iyer,"" Arjun growled. ""He’s the judge, jury, and executioner.""

They rushed to Iyer’s estate, but the confrontation was a shock. They found Iyer bound to a **motorized wheelchair**, paralyzed by advanced ALS. He couldn't even grip a glass of water, let alone orchestrate a series of physical hits across state lines.

**The Legal Aide**

Rohan went back to the data. He pulled the **tower dump logs** from the vicinity of every accident. One burner phone pinged at every single site. It belonged to **Sameer**, Iyer’s quiet legal aide—the man who carried the files and drove the van.

Arjun arrested Sameer on the steps of the High Court. The digital footprints were a perfect match.

**The Final Acquittal**

The trial was a sensation. Sameer stood in the dock, but he was represented by Iyer himself. From his wheelchair, using a voice synthesizer, Iyer tore the digital evidence apart. ""Proximity is not presence,"" Iyer rasped through the speakers. ""Can a phone push a car? Can a signal cause a heart attack?""

52,I’ve been handling police cases for 27 years. These are my thoughts on the Renee Good shooting.,1q9qkyx,TwinCities,331,30,2026-01-11 05:06:35,Badger_Vito,"This was drafted yesterday, and has been tweaked since, so forgive any outdated references.

I have been a litigator for 27 years.  (My first solo trial, during my first six months of practice as a young Air Force JAG, involved prosecuting a civilian wife who had bitten an Air Force Security Forces cop responding a domestic situation she had precipitated in front of a US Magistrate.)  I have handled double-digit numbers of police civil rights cases, usually (but not always) representing defendant officers accused of wrongdoing.  This includes numerous fatal officer-involved shootings.  I have spent nearly all of the last 7-8 years defending police officers.  I am proud of this work.  I don't believe anyone who knows me at all would consider me knee-jerk when it comes to evaluating police uses of force.  To the contrary, I'm sure I routinely annoy my liberal friends and family members by reminding them of the police perspective on cases involving split-second decisions by cops, and by my insistence on being guided by the evidence, not by emotion.

I find the death of Renee Good haunting and persistently unsettling.  Even if one steps outside of the analysis of this particular use of force, there is just no question that the ""surge"" of more than 2,000 masked, anonymous federal agents (many more than the total number of sworn city LE officers locally), bearing no name tapes, badges or even agency insignia, and driving unmarked rental cars, has made our cities less safe.  They are, pretty transparently, racially profiling and rounding up people of color, many of whom prove to have legal status or even be US citizens.  Nothing that has occurred here in the Somali community mandates this, or even suggests that it might be a good idea, much less a good use of taxpayer resources.  (A week or two ago, a video emerged of something like 40 agents arresting a single, peaceful subject at a public library, reinforcing what a farce the entire ""surge"" is.  The same day Renee Good was killed, ICE forcefully arrested two teenage US citizens for the crime of working at a suburban Target store while Latin.  Your tax dollars at work!)  

The enormous fraud which has been perpetrated against the State of Minnesota (in part but not at all entirely by Somali-Americans) is terrible, and I hope those responsible are all prosecuted.  That said, they are generally US citizens, so the use of immigration authorities does nothing to alleviate the problem.  More importantly, the entire Somali community is not responsible for the actions of a handful of bad actors, any more than all white people are responsible for the acts of Aimee Bock.  It appears ICE is not here to work on an actual immigration issue, but to terrorize and troll our communities.  You and I are paying millions of dollars a day for this.

Turning to the incident itself, this was, it seems to me, a hugely problematic use of deadly force, particularly in light of the video released by Alpha News today (showing Agent Ross' perspective).  Simply put, I do not believe anyone acting in good faith who watches that video could conclude that Renee intended to hit anyone with her car - in fact the evidence shows she clearly did not.  As to the more complex question as to whether Agent Ross could have reasonably perceived her as a threat justifying the use of deadly force, I think there is a credible argument the first shot was justified, but for me the second and third shots are much more problematic.  The video released today gives me much greater skepticism of the use of force by Ross, as it creates a context showing that Good was not angry or even unfriendly immediately prior to the shooting.  It appears Ross acted more out of anger than fear (perhaps because Renee's wife verbally teased him in a completely non-threatening manner).  

In any normal situation, in which the government were led by good-faith actors/decent human beings, the authorities would grimly state that this is a tragic incident, but that it's premature to comment on whether the shooting was justified until a complete investigation could be conducted.  Instead, Kristi Noem and President Trump immediately (in Noem's case, before the scene was even cleared) concluded, and stated, that Good was a ""domestic terrorist"" and ""deranged leftist,"" and that the shooting was entirely justified.  They said, before any of us knew Renee Good’s name, that she was a professional agitator acting on behalf of a shadowy, unnamed leftist conspiracy.  They then proceeded, after initially agreeing to a joint investigation with Minnesota BCA, to declare that the investigation must be handled entirely by federal authorities (the same ones who had definitively concluded the outcome of the investigation before it had even begun).

I struggle to understand Americans who are so brainwashed, and have such hate in their hearts, that they have no trepidation about our cities being overrun by masked agents, or those agents killing a US citizen trying to drive away.  Every law enforcement officer in the US is trained (and DHS' own written policy mandates) that shooting at a moving car is something to be avoided at all costs.  Here, instead, it appears Agent Ross put himself in front of the car (contrary to LE training and common sense), then, when Renee Good attempted to drive away (by which time he was to the side of the car, away from the direction its wheels were turned), acted on a snap impulse.  He shot her three times at point blank range, then called her a ""fucking bitch"" as her lifeless body drove her vehicle into a parked car.  This happened as he held his phone in one hand and his pistol in the other.  He wasn't knocked from his feet, much less “run over.”  He then left the scene while his colleagues failed to render medical aid, and in fact prevented a physician who happened to be a neighbor from doing so (you will not be surprised to learn that none of these post-shooting actions are consistent with basic LE training).  Within minutes, the federal government had promulgated a totally false narrative (including a provably false set of ""facts"" bearing little or no relationship to the reality we all saw with our own eyes) to support the notion that she was a ""domestic terrorist.""  

I am even more gobsmacked by the fact that we have members of Congress like Nancy Mace, and local commentators (including my former law-firm colleague Doug Wardlow, a broadly reviled one-term state legislator who really really thinks he should be our AG, seemingly a sentiment unique to him and members of his immediate family) reacting to Gov Walz' measured, thoughtful response to the incident.  They believe (or say they believe) that for the ""crime"" of preparing to, if necessary, activate the National Guard to maintain public order, Walz should be arrested for sedition, and the President should apply the Insurrection Act and impose martial law.  Walz (himself a friggin' Command Sgt Major in the Guard) has done everything he can to maintain peace and order during a chaotic time created entirely by the federal government.  He certainly hasn't threatened to use the Guard in defense against ICE, but those who hate him have chosen to interpret his words that way.  It's positively Orwellian.

Speaking of Orwellian, the Vice President (a graduate of Yale Law School) yesterday declared that Agent Ross is entitled to ""absolute immunity.""  Even if you entirely support this particular use of force, imagine a world in which the government were free to kill its citizens with, literally, absolute immunity from consequence.  The idea that someone at that level not only claims this is the law (hint - it's not), but insists it applies to an incident which happened the previous day, prior to any investigation, is fucking nuts.  If the use-of-force and immunity standards were what the White House says they must be, January 6 would have culminated in thousands of dead civilians and hundreds of traumatized, legally-immune Capitol Police members.

At this point it seems we are in the midst of a deliberate pogrom against the residents of Democrat-led cities, funded by our own tax dollars, and my hometown is Ground Zero.  This is endlessly depressing and upsetting.  

I pray our community and our nation can survive this.  It's clear the President is hoping for mass civil unrest and martial law.  Let's please not give that to him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/1q9qkyx/ive_been_handling_police_cases_for_27_years_these/,"I’ve been handling police cases for 27 years. These are my thoughts on the Renee Good shooting. 30 This was drafted yesterday, and has been tweaked since, so forgive any outdated references.

I have been a litigator for 27 years.  (My first solo trial, during my first six months of practice as a young Air Force JAG, involved prosecuting a civilian wife who had bitten an Air Force Security Forces cop responding a domestic situation she had precipitated in front of a US Magistrate.)  I have handled double-digit numbers of police civil rights cases, usually (but not always) representing defendant officers accused of wrongdoing.  This includes numerous fatal officer-involved shootings.  I have spent nearly all of the last 7-8 years defending police officers.  I am proud of this work.  I don't believe anyone who knows me at all would consider me knee-jerk when it comes to evaluating police uses of force.  To the contrary, I'm sure I routinely annoy my liberal friends and family members by reminding them of the police perspective on cases involving split-second decisions by cops, and by my insistence on being guided by the evidence, not by emotion.

So let them speak but don't take this whole thing to heart. Don't let someone across the world change your views on **your** India. It's not bad like they say and it's no future superpower either.

It's build from suffering and happiness we found in that suffering, corruption and the devoted believers who fight that corruption, poor and rich and how both of them could despise this nation or hope to build it up into something just a little better. Someone will hate this country and leave it and someone will hate it enough to change it through sheer pettiness. You can be either of those people and it's ok.

Again. Just my view on this. Everyone thinks in a different way.

When you live in a community where you have seen so much despair you will carry hate and love for it, because for years our business has not been our own. We think and talk about everyone as if we are their relatives.

We celebrate every success of the smallest degree of our people like we knew the person personally. Because at the end of the day, they are someone who have faced the hardship you grew in and managed to make something out of themselves. And the foreigners would never understand the exact feeling. Even if they say that they have seen that kind of problems in their own country, it's not the same. They haven't grew up here so it's not the same.

Our sufferings are unique to us, we will talk shit about everything and anything that involves the condition of our nation. But these other people who don't understand what we have seen others went through and still make fun of them, it's normal to get triggered. And obviously the outsiders with no context would find it unusual. It's not their fault either. But it's wrong to be racist and ignorant about it . 

So let them speak but don't take this whole thing to heart. Don't let someone across the world change your views on **your** India. It's not bad like they say and it's no future superpower either.

 It's build from suffering and happiness we found in that suffering, corruption and the devoted believers who fight that corruption, poor and rich and how both of them could despise this nation or hope to build it up into something just a little better. Someone will hate this country and leave it and someone will hate it enough to change it through sheer pettiness. You can be either of those people and it's ok.  

Again. Just my view on this. Everyone thinks in a different way.",this hate against india and is it valid how we cope with it i know india gets bashed a lot around the world we defend ourselves then someone come and says we should not defend the truth then we fire back with pointing out the mistakes in another country how the hate is targeted and heavily racist i am not telling anyone what they should do and not do i am a teenager from what i understand and what my eyes see there is nothing wrong with bashing your own country or fighting for it we can defend our country s honor without making excuses we can call out racists without bragging about ourselves yes we have problems there are people who are just genuinely mannerless and then there are those who don t have a choice of being clean or be civic the majority of us are lower middle class the world is not going to understand the problem our beef with one country or friendship with other the inner battle between casts and religions and they are wrong but they are a result of generational trauma brainwashing poverty personal conflicts and conditioning when you live in a community where you have seen so much despair you will carry hate and love for it because for years our business has not been our own we think and talk about everyone as if we are their relatives we celebrate every success of the smallest degree of our people like we knew the person personally because at the end of the day they are someone who have faced the hardship you grew in and managed to make something out of themselves and the foreigners would never understand the exact feeling even if they say that they have seen that kind of problems in their own country it s not the same they haven t grew up here so it s not the same our sufferings are unique to us we will talk shit about everything and anything that involves the condition of our nation but these other people who don t understand what we have seen others went through and still make fun of them it s normal to get triggered and obviously the outsiders with no context would find it unusual it s not their fault either but it s wrong to be racist and ignorant about it so let them speak but don t take this whole thing to heart don t let someone across the world change your views on your india it s not bad like they say and it s no future superpower either it s build from suffering and happiness we found in that suffering corruption and the devoted believers who fight that corruption poor and rich and how both of them could despise this nation or hope to build it up into something just a little better someone will hate this country and leave it and someone will hate it enough to change it through sheer pettiness you can be either of those people and it s ok again just my view on this everyone thinks in a different way,2,2026-01-11 05:55:59,NEGATIVE,0.990253210067749,critical,2,True,2026-01-11 05:55:59

However as of January 2026, this approach has shown significant vulnerabilities, arguably backfiring in several critical domains, particularly energy security, defence modernization, and regional deterrence.

# Energy Security and the Russian Oil Bet

India's diversification of oil imports toward Russia post 2022 Ukraine conflict initially yielded economic benefits through discounted crude, shielding the economy from global price spikes. This move aligned with multi-alignment by maintaining ties with Russia amid Western sanctions.

Yet by late 2025 and into 2026 the policy has imposed severe costs. US sanctions on Russian energy firms (e.g., Rosneft and Lukoil) and reciprocal tariffs on India sitting at 50% one of the highest in the world. Threats of up to 500% under the proposed Sanctioning Russia Act 2025 have disrupted supplies(m personally i'm from surat and entire diamond industry of $21-24bn is doomed. Remember the largest building in world in surat for diamonds is now a ghost building due to tarrifs and textile too). Russian oil imports to India dropped sharply (e.g., from \~1.8 million bpd in November 2025 to \~1.0-1.2 million bpd in December), forcing reliance on costlier alternatives and raising import bills by billions. This highlights how over-reliance on one partner even for diversification has exposed India to secondary sanctions and geopolitical coercion, undermining the intended resilience. Russia is a soon to be chinese vassal, other than high end defence equipments it has no strategic value. Realtionship between russia and india is like of an estranged couple where in one partner is still stuck in soviet era tech and has fucked up it's calibre and relationship  globally has failed in ukraine war and now is becoming a liability.

# Post-Operation Sindoor: Information War and Equivalence with Pakistan

Operation Sindoor (May 2025), India's response to the Pahalgam terror attack, involved precision strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK. Militarily, it demonstrated capability and established a new threshold for counter-terrorism retaliation.

However, the aftermath revealed weaknesses in India's **information warfare** and **diplomatic outrich and narrative**. Pakistan effectively countered with disinformation, portraying the strikes as aggression and civilian-targeted, leading to international perceptions of equivalence between India and Pakistan despite India's focus on terror infrastructure. This has equated the two on the global stage, diluting India's victim narrative and complicating efforts to isolate Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.

Let me tell you what has pakistan achieved :- It has once again equated india pak on global level. It has gained it's geo-strategic position due to middle east wars. It has nullified the talks on india-china gap in defence capabilites and once again gained postion in becoming #1 enemy of india dethroning china. Once gain became a darling of CIA and biggest non-nato us ally. The real multi-alignment using china and US both. Deep western media penetration in terms of narratives establishment. Didn't allow india to establish that recent squirmesh was india vs pak-terror infr. It successfully showed india as aggressor unto a state.

# Widening Military Gap with China and Domestic Defence Shortfalls

The military disparity with China continues to grow. China's declared defence budget (\~$245 billion in 2025, likely 40-50% higher unofficially) dwarfs India's \~$78-81 billion (FY 2025-26 allocation), enabling rapid modernization in stealth, naval, and hypersonic capabilities.

India's indigenous programs lag:

* Tejas is in dooldroms, AMCA TEDBF is nothing but PPT's, No serious funding or investing in institutions to build capabilities.
* Joking clown debacle of ADG of lasers on ak-47 in night. Shows how unserious and full of ourself we are.
* Navy subs nowshere. Mig 29k are flying coffins. outdated carrierers, Not navy heli's too.

Defence spending stays at \~1.9% of GDP, with heavy allocations to pensions (\~24%) and salaries, leaving limited capital for modernization (\~26%). Recent corruption cases (e.g., army officer bribery arrests in late 2025) further erode credibility. PowerPoint presentations of capabilities, but actual funding and commitment fall short, unlike the US, which increases defence spending despite debt.

# Diplomatic and Dependency Issues

Jaishankar's leadership navigated the Russia-Ukraine crisis effectively, securing energy and avoiding full Western isolation. However, diversification from French (Rafale), Israeli, and Russian systems has been null, leaving India vulnerable to supply disruptions and geopolitical shifts. Ties with China remain strained, while US relations sour over Russian oil. Bets on Europe in 2026 appear optimistic, given Europe's own challenges and India's oil-related baggage.

# The Core Problem: Lack of Seriousness in Self-Reliance

At its heart, India's establishment appears unserious about indigenous R&D. Brain drain persists due to underinvestment in tech institutions, and expectations rely on joint ventures or technology transfers (from France/Israel) rather than building core capabilities. Without a massive leap, such as pushing defence to $100 billion (well beyond the current \~$78-81 billion) India risks remaining a ""PPT power"" rather than a credible one.

Multi-alignment has bought time and flexibility but in a transactional, polarized world, it has exposed dependencies and hesitations. Unless India commits decisively to self-reliance, reforms bureaucracy, and backs rhetoric with resources, the policy's process costs will continue to outweigh its benefits.

I am from the UK and Indians are incredibly disliked here, and across the Western hemisphere. 

Whilst there is no doubt racism plays its part, but that's not the full explanation. On a surface level, in my opinion, the following reasons cause this dislike:

1. Support for Israel despite the Western consensus of a genocide being committed. In the West, this is seen as nothing more than deep anti-Muslim hatred. 

2. Recent images of Indian (Hindu) men destroying anything related to Christianity during Christmas. 

3. Indian men having a reputation for harassing women, and it being unsafe in India for female tourists, especially white Western females. 

4. R*pe cases that filter through to Western news. 

5. Poor hygiene of India as a whole, in particular the street food. 

6. Indians lacking civility and civic sense when they move to more socially developed countries in the West. 

7. Indians imposing their culture and music on the host nation. In London, it's very common for Indian men and women to play loud Bollywood music in public, cause a commotion and dance in the streets, without a thought for the locals.

58,Nepal politics - what do we need to understand? Part 2,1q9bvis,Nepal,2,2,2026-01-10 18:41:14,NoRestaurant6163,"Previously, I wrote a post in this group outlining my views on politics. It seems many readers did not fully grasp my position, and some responded with personal attacks. However, given recent shifts in global geopolitics (US attack on Venezuela, India buying more gold, China keeping quiet) and the fact that much of the Nepalese media does not address what I consider to be the core issues, I think it is necessary to clarify the arguments I raised earlier and connect them to recent political developments in Nepal.

I will begin with the Western education model. My argument is not against education itself. It is against how the Western education system, and its underlying assumptions, are imported and treated as universally correct. In the previous post, this distinction was misunderstood. To explain this properly, let's dive into democracy. Democracy is a system of government in which power is exercised by the population, usually through elected representatives. The problem is that democracy is taught and consumed as an inherently good system (see news and school books). Like any system of governance, democracy has flaws. These flaws are rarely discussed openly. At the same time, the failures of other systems are emphasized through narratives. As a result, people are educated to criticize alternatives while remaining largely unaware of the weaknesses within democracy itself.

This mindset is visible in Nepal’s political discourse. There is a growing tendency to frame politics as a moral binary: old parties are entirely wrong, and new parties or new faces are entirely right. This framing is simplistic and analytically weak. Political systems do not function on moral purity. They function on power, incentives, and institutional constraints.

This brings me to corruption and meritocracy. Phrases like “the right person in the right place” are vague and often used to mislead. They assume that governance is primarily a technical problem, when in reality it is a political one. In practice, power is sustained through trust networks, not abstract merit. The second-in-command is chosen based on loyalty and reliability, not only competence. Without this, no organization, whether a family, a firm, or a state, can function. There is no moral judgment here. This is how systems operate.

The same logic applies to corruption. Corruption is often discussed as an anomaly, but it is better understood as a behavioural feature of human systems. States do not survive despite corruption. Many survive because of it. The most corrupt countries in the world are not Nepal or India. Countries like Nepal, India, and China have endured for centuries precisely because people did not fully depend on the state and instead relied on personal networks, informal arrangements, and self-interest. This is what is labelled as corruption. When historically dominant states decline, it is often because governments become rigidly capitalist while populations become dependent and socialist in behavior. Nepal has survived because people remain economically self-reliant and do not expect the state to provide everything. As the current fiat monetary system weakens, this reality will become clearer, so I will not elaborate further here.

Regarding figures like Balen and Oli, I am not commenting on personal traits, only on public roles. Both have contributed to Nepal in different ways. Oli, given his long tenure, has had a broader impact. Balen, like Oli, has overpromised and underdelivered. This is not an endorsement of one over the other. Politics is not about moral correctness. It is a competitive game governed by rules. Those rules can be changed, but only by those who understand the system well enough to win within it. If one side loses, the rational response is to comply, reassess, and prepare for the next round.

Finally, I believe we have been taught incorrectly at a foundational level. Many of our political and social assumptions, inherited through western education frameworks, do not align with human behavior. Competition, not idealism, is the fundamental driver of human systems. Any attempt at reform that ignores this will fail. To change a system, one must first understand it fully. By system, I mean it more than elections. Asia’s population dominance over Europe is not accidental. Asian societies adapted to systems rather than idealizing them. That adaptability, not moral superiority, explains survival and scale (both time and number).

  
I want you all to consider development in light of this. What does the definition of development mean without the framework of western education system/definition? And how would you like Nepal to develop?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1q9bvis/nepal_politics_what_do_we_need_to_understand_part/,"Nepal politics - what do we need to understand?

It is a competitive game governed by rules. Those rules can be changed, but only by those who understand the system well enough to win within it. If one side loses, the rational response is to comply, reassess, and prepare for the next round.

Finally, I believe we have been taught incorrectly at a foundational level. Many of our political and social assumptions, inherited through western education frameworks, do not align with human behavior. Competition, not idealism, is the fundamental driver of human systems. Any attempt at reform that ignores this will fail. To change a system, one must first understand it fully. By system, I mean it more than elections. Asia’s population dominance over Europe is not accidental. Asian societies adapted to systems rather than idealizing them. That adaptability, not moral superiority, explains survival and scale (both time and number).

  
I want you all to consider development in light of this. What does the definition of development mean without the framework of western education system/definition? And how would you like Nepal to develop?",nepal politics what do we need to understand part previously i wrote a post in this group outlining my views on politics it seems many readers did not fully grasp my position and some responded with personal attacks however given recent shifts in global geopolitics us attack on venezuela india buying more gold china keeping quiet and the fact that much of the nepalese media does not address what i consider to be the core issues i think it is necessary to clarify the arguments i raised earlier and connect them to recent political developments in nepal i will begin with the western education model my argument is not against education itself it is against how the western education system and its underlying assumptions are imported and treated as universally correct in the previous post this distinction was misunderstood to explain this properly let s dive into democracy democracy is a system of government in which power is exercised by the population usually through elected representatives the problem is that democracy is taught and consumed as an inherently good system see news and school books like any system of governance democracy has flaws these flaws are rarely discussed openly at the same time the failures of other systems are emphasized through narratives as a result people are educated to criticize alternatives while remaining largely unaware of the weaknesses within democracy itself this mindset is visible in nepal s political discourse there is a growing tendency to frame politics as a moral binary old parties are entirely wrong and new parties or new faces are entirely right this framing is simplistic and analytically weak political systems do not function on moral purity they function on power incentives and institutional constraints this brings me to corruption and meritocracy phrases like the right person in the right place are vague and often used to mislead they assume that governance is primarily a technical problem when in reality it is a political one in practice power is sustained through trust networks not abstract merit the second in command is chosen based on loyalty and reliability not only competence without this no organization whether a family a firm or a state can function there is no moral judgment here this is how systems operate the same logic applies to corruption corruption is often discussed as an anomaly but it is better understood as a behavioural feature of human systems states do not survive despite corruption many survive because of it the most corrupt countries in the world are not nepal or india countries like nepal india and china have endured for centuries precisely because people did not fully depend on the state and instead relied on personal networks informal arrangements and self interest this is what is labelled as corruption when historically dominant states decline it is often because governments become rigidly capitalist while populations become dependent and socialist in behavior nepal has survived because people remain economically self reliant and do not expect the state to provide everything as the current fiat monetary system weakens this reality will become clearer so i will not elaborate further here regarding figures like balen and oli i am not commenting on personal traits only on public roles both have contributed to nepal in different ways oli given his long tenure has had a broader impact balen like oli has overpromised and underdelivered this is not an endorsement of one over the other politics is not about moral correctness it is a competitive game governed by rules those rules can be changed but only by those who understand the system well enough to win within it if one side loses the rational response is to comply reassess and prepare for the next round finally i believe we have been taught incorrectly at a foundational level many of our political and social assumptions inherited through western education frameworks do not align with human behavior competition not idealism is the fundamental driver of human systems any attempt at reform that ignores this will fail to change a system one must first understand it fully by system i mean it more than elections asia s population dominance over europe is not accidental asian societies adapted to systems rather than idealizing them that adaptability not moral superiority explains survival and scale both time and number i want you all to consider development in light of this what does the definition of development mean without the framework of western education system definition and how would you like nepal to develop,2,2026-01-10 18:41:14,NEGATIVE,0.9974404573440552,critical,1,True,2026-01-10 18:41:14

**Introduction**

Shon Mehta is an Indian woman philosopher and novelist who occupies a distinctive space in modern literature. A known **social recluse**, Mehta lets her work speak for itself, rarely appearing in **public interviews or functions**. This detachment from the ""celebrity author"" persona has allowed her works—which blend fiction, parable, and philosophical inquiry—to take on a life of their own.

Through novels like **The Timingila** and **Lair of the Monster**, Mehta engages deeply with questions of identity, power, and human perception. Her writing has achieved significant academic recognition across borders: her story **""The Girl Who Asked Why""** serves as the Primary text for Unit 7: Gender Equality and Equity in the Grade 8 National English Curriculum of **Pakistan**, and is also part of the official Class 10 SCERT/MGU curricula in **India**. However, her stylistic clarity and ""timeless"" quality have led to widespread de-attribution, where her original thoughts circulate as ""ancient"" or anonymous wisdom.

**Why Her Work Resonates Globally**

A primary factor in Mehta’s appeal is her ability to address **universal human concerns** through a distinctively clear lens.

* **Narrative as Philosophy:** Stories like *True Mastery* don't just lecture; they enact inquiry through character choices, making complex ethics accessible.
* **Temporal Ambiguity:** By setting stories in historically indeterminate locales, Mehta creates a ""timeless"" atmosphere. In her literary world, the kingdoms of **Jivavarta** serve as a sophisticated **sociological laboratory**, where she strips away modern distractions to isolate and observe the raw mechanics of power, ambition, and moral choice in their most concentrated forms. This allows readers from any culture to project their own context onto the story.
* **Aphoristic Precision:** Mehta condenses complex psychology into ""sticky"" sentences that translate easily across languages.

**The Paradox of Misattribution and De-attribution**

Ironically, the same qualities that make Mehta’s work successful—universality, aphoristic clarity, and her absence from public functions—facilitate the erosion of authorial recognition. Because her parables and reflections feel like ""pre-existing cultural wisdom,"" they are frequently stripped of her name and shared as anonymous proverbs.

**Notable examples of de-attribution include:**

* **The Ultimate ""Villain"" Quote:** *“Maybe I am a villain in your story, but I am a hero in mine.”* (Originally from her debut novel **The Timingila**; now a global staple of social media ""anonymous"" wisdom).
* **On Power and Corruption:** *“Power is the lair that breeds monsters... often, a new ruler enters the lair imagining himself to be a hero... however, as time passes, he himself becomes the monster.”* (From her novel **Lair of the Monster**).
* **The Character Test:** *“Judge a man's character by how he treats people he does not know, and things he does not own.”* (Often mistaken for a historical maxim).(From her novel **The Timingila)**
* **Moral Maxims:** Lines like *""When poor, overdress. When rich, underdress""* (from *Appearance*) often circulate as generic lifestyle advice.
* **The Power of Simple Joy:** *“Never underestimate the power of good food. Eating delicious food can be a life-changing experience.'”* (Widely quoted without credit in lifestyle and culinary circles).(From her novel **The Timingila)**
* **The Garden of Statues:** Often shared as a generic folk tale rather than a contemporary intellectual creation.
* **On Self-Worth & Betrayal:** *“I was ready to die for you, but never realized that it was you who will kill me.”*(From her novel **The Timingila)**
* **On Relationships:** *“We all are wounded, we all are healers. Time changes, role changes.”*(From her novel **The Timingila)**
* **On True Success:** *“One can never know the thrill of a climb if one is born at the top.”* **The Uncharted Mind** 
* **On Love & Happiness:** *“When someone else's happiness becomes the prerequisite of your happiness, you know that you are in love.”* (From her novel **The Timingila)**
* **On Hypocrisy and Conflict:** *“When it happens against us, it is a war crime. When it happens against our enemy, it is collateral damage.”* (From **Lair of the Monster**).

**Bibliography & Major Works**

For those interested in exploring her narrative-philosophical style, her major works include:

* **The Timingila** (Novel)
* **Lair of the Monster** (Novel)
* **The Girl Who Asked Why** ( Story - Featured in Grade 8 National Curriculum of Pakistan and Class 10 SCERT/MGU curricula in India and many other Asian countries)

* **The Uncharted Mind** (Poetry and thoughts)

**Conclusion: The Longevity of Narrative Philosophy**

The worldwide appeal of Mehta’s work suggests a deep hunger for **moral complexity without dogma**. By using fiction as a ""thought experiment,"" she allows readers to engage with ethics without feeling preached to. While the internet may continue to misattribute her quotes—perhaps aided by her own choice to avoid the spotlight of **public interviews**—the enduring relevance of her themes ensures that her philosophical labor continues to shape global conversations on power and identity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Shadshadsha/comments/1q9afnz/the_ancient_wisdom_trap_why_indian_woman/,"The ""Ancient Wisdom"" Trap: Why Indian woman philosopher-novelist Shon Mehta’s work is everywhere, but her name often isn't. 0 **Shon Mehta: Indian Woman Philosopher-Novelist, Global Reception, and the Mystery of De-attribution**

**8.4 Economic Diversification Imperative**

The state's energy infrastructure expansion (both thermal and renewable) combined with women empowerment schemes and tribal development programs reflects broader strategy for sustainable and inclusive economic growth beyond traditional mineral-dependent sectors.



**Conclusion**

December 2025 represented a month of significant institutional activity and political complexity for Jharkhand State. The second supplementary budget of Rs 7,721.25 crore demonstrated continued government investment in welfare and development programs, while the Patratu thermal power project's commercial operation marked an important milestone in energy infrastructure.

However, the month also reflected underlying political tensions stemming from the Bihar election aftermath and coalition dynamics between JMM and Congress. Law enforcement achievements in Dhanbad suggest positive progress in public safety management, yet opposition concerns about governance and corruption remain contested issues.

The state's trajectory in subsequent months will be shaped by:

1. **Political Stability:** Management of coalition tensions and alignment with electoral cycles
2. **Infrastructure Delivery:** Successful completion of major projects within planned timelines
3. **Governance Effectiveness:** Addressing corruption allegations and improving public service delivery
4. **Economic Development:** Balancing mineral-dependent economy with diversification into renewable energy and other sectors
5. **Social Welfare:** Effective implementation of women empowerment and tribal development programs

Overall, December 2025 positioning Jharkhand at a critical juncture where political, infrastructural, and administrative decisions will significantly influence the state's development trajectory and governance quality in the coming fiscal year.

62,Christianity is killing itself.,1q98qm2,DebateReligion,6,96,2026-01-10 16:40:21,bravethink,"I need to get something off my chest, and I don't care if it makes people uncomfortable. I've spent most of my life in church, and I'm watching our faith kill itself. Not because of atheists. Not because of secular culture. Because of us. Because we've become so allergic to truth that we've replaced it with two dangerous alternatives: fundamentalist dogmatism on one side, progressive slush on the other, with a huge amount of nominal Christians in the middle who can't tell the difference and don't really care.

Let me tell you what I mean, because I'm not speaking in abstracts here. I'm talking about real churches, real people, real damage.

I grew up in a fundamentalist church where the pastor spent forty-five minutes every Sunday explaining why dinosaur bones were either Satan's deception or flood debris. I'm not exaggerating, this was presented as serious Christian doctrine. As if believing the earth is 6,000 years old was somehow a test of your faithfulness. As if God gave us brains and then expected us to leave them at the door.

The thing that drove me crazy then, and still drives me crazy now, is that these people genuinely think they're defending historic Christianity. They think they're the faithful remnant holding the line against modern corruption. But they're not. They're defending a version of Christianity that's barely a century old. The term ""fundamentalism"" itself only dates to 1920s America. Before that, you had Christians who believed all sorts of things about Genesis without anyone questioning their orthodoxy.

Saint Augustine, one of the most influential theologians in Christian history wrote in The Literal Meaning of Genesis around 415 AD that Christians who make absurd claims about the physical world based on Scripture bring shame to the faith. He said that when non-believers hear Christians contradicting observable reality, they assume everything else Christians say is nonsense too. And he wrote that in the fifth century, long before modern science gave us any reason to be defensive.

Origen read Genesis allegorically. So did Philo of Alexandria. The idea that Genesis 1-2 must be read as a literal, chronological, scientific account would have been foreign to many early Christians. They understood something fundamentalists have forgotten: the Bible is a library of books written in different genres, at different times, for different audiences. You can't read a psalm the same way you read a historical narrative. You can't read Revelation the same way you read Romans. Genre matters. Context matters. History matters.

But here's where fundamentalism becomes actively destructive, not just annoying. The resurrection. This is the hill Christianity lives or dies on. Paul couldn't be clearer in 1 Corinthians 15: if Christ hasn't been raised, our preaching is useless, our faith is useless, we're still in our sins, and those who died believing in Christ are lost. The resurrection is non-negotiable. It's the whole thing.

So how do fundamentalists defend it? Usually by yelling louder about faith and quoting Bible verses at skeptics. That's not apologetics. That's not even an argument. That's giving up before the fight starts. That's admitting you have no evidence and trying to make a virtue out of it.

Meanwhile, the actual evidence for the resurrection is staggering. We have better manuscript attestation for the New Testament than for any other document from antiquity, and it's not even close. Over 25,000 Greek manuscripts and fragments, plus thousands more in Latin, Coptic, Syriac, and other languages. The earliest fragment, P52, a tiny piece of John's Gospel dates to around 125 AD, maybe 30 years after John wrote it.

Compare that to other ancient texts we take for granted. Homer's Iliad, the second-best attested ancient work, has about 1,800 manuscripts. Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars, which we use as a primary source for Roman history, has ten manuscripts, and the oldest dates to 900 years after Caesar wrote it. For the New Testament, we have fragments within decades of the original composition. The text is the best-attested ancient document in existence.

>

This is a creed, a formalized statement of belief that predates Paul's letter. Scholars across the theological spectrum date this creed to within 3 to 5 years of the crucifixion, based on when Paul received it (likely from Peter and James in Jerusalem around 35-36 AD) and linguistic features in the Greek that suggest it was translated from Aramaic.Think about what that means. We're not talking about legends that developed over centuries. We're talking about testimony from within half a decade of the events, from people who claimed to be eyewitnesses. This is historical gold.

Even skeptical scholars accept the basic facts. Bart Ehrman, an agnostic who built his career on New Testament criticism, accepts that Jesus was crucified, that his followers believed they saw him alive afterward, and that even enemies like Paul and James converted based on these experiences. Gerd Lüdemann, an atheist scholar, calls the disciples' experiences ""historically certain."" The debate isn't whether something happened, it's how to explain what happened.

But fundamentalists don't present this evidence. They don't teach their kids that Christianity is defensible. They teach them that faith means believing without evidence, that doubt is sin, that asking questions is dangerous. So when those kids hit college and meet their first competent atheist, their faith collapses like a house of cards.

>

That blood is on fundamentalism's hands.

But the other side is just as guilty, just quieter about it.

Progressive Christianity looks different on the surface. It's welcoming, affirming, full of talk about love and justice and inclusion. The music is better. The sermons reference poetry and philosophy. But it's empty. Theologically empty. Spiritually empty. Progressive Christianity has managed to strip Christianity of everything that makes it Christian while still calling itself Christian. Listen to a progressive sermon and count how many minutes are spent on the resurrection as a historical event. Not as a metaphor for hope. Not as a symbol of transformation. As an actual thing that happened in real time and space, Jesus of Nazareth, executed by Rome, physically raised from the dead three days later.

You'll be lucky if it gets mentioned at all. And if it does, it'll be hedged with language about ""the experience of resurrection"" or ""resurrection as a way of being in the world."" Translation: we don't actually believe it happened, but we think the metaphor is nice.

This isn't an accident. Progressive Christianity is the end result of two centuries of liberal theology trying to make Christianity acceptable to modern people by cutting away everything modern people find offensive. Miracles? Gone. Virgin birth? Optional. Hell? Definitely gone. Exclusive truth claims? How dare you. What's left is a vague spirituality that sounds Christian because it uses Christian vocabulary but means something entirely different. Jesus isn't the incarnate Son of God who died for sins and rose from the dead. He's a wise teacher who was nice to marginalized people and got killed by the empire. Following Jesus doesn't mean repentance and faith. It means being nice and voting for the right politicians.

This version of Christianity has been tried. Mainline Protestantism went all-in on liberal theology in the mid-20th century. They questioned the supernatural, affirmed everything culture wanted them to affirm, focused on social justice, watered down doctrine to make it more palatable.

And they died.

These are denominations in demographic freefall. And the excuse is always the same: ""Everyone's leaving church, it's just secularization."" Except that's not true. Conservative denominations that hold to historic Christian doctrine are growing or holding steady. Non-denominational evangelical churches are packed. Orthodox Christianity in America is growing. The churches that are dying are the ones that decided to be more like the world. Progressive Christianity offers nothing you can't get from secular humanism without the hassle. If Jesus is just a good moral teacher, why bother with church when you can sleep in and read Marcus Aurelius? If Christianity is just about being a decent person and fighting for justice, why not cut out the middleman and join a nonprofit?

The only reason to be Christian is if Christianity is true. Not metaphorically true. Not ""true for you."" Actually, historically, objectively true. If Jesus didn’t really rise from the dead, Paul was right, we should be pitied above all people, because we're wasting our time. But progressive Christianity can't say Christianity is uniquely true, because that would mean other religions are false, and that's too mean. So they retreat into relativism: all paths lead to God, Jesus is one way among many, we're all just trying our best.

And that’s where it gets really galling. Because progressive Christians are very selective about which religions they’re willing to criticize. They’ll write endless think pieces about how white evangelicals are complicit in American empire. They’ll call out the Catholic Church’s sex abuse scandals and they should. But ask them about Islam, and suddenly it’s all “we must respect diverse faith traditions.” Meanwhile, in Islamic theocratic countries, women face severe restrictions. Apostates are executed. Homosexuals are persecuted. Girls have their genitals mutilated. Honor killings occur. Where are the progressive Christian marches for them? Where's the outrage?

It's nowhere, because calling out Islam would require acknowledging that some cultures and religions are worse than others, and that violates the progressive commitment to relativism. Better to focus on safe targets, fundamentalists, conservatives, people who won't literally kill you for criticizing them.

This is moral cowardice dressed up as compassion, and it makes me sick.

But here's the dirty secret: neither fundamentalists nor progressives are the biggest problem. They’re loud, they’re visible, they get all the attention. But they’re small minorities. The real problem is nominalism, the vast middle ground of people who call themselves Christian but don’t actually believe or practice much of anything. They show up on Christmas and Easter. They like the aesthetic. They think Jesus was probably a good guy. They might pray occasionally when things get bad.

But they can’t articulate what they believe. They haven’t read the Bible in years, if ever. They couldn’t defend the resurrection to save their lives. They’ve never heard of the church fathers. They think “faith” means believing something without evidence, which is exactly what atheists think it means, and exactly why atheists reject it.

This is the Christianity that many ex-Christians were raised in. One atheist commenter I encountered said: ""I can't consciously choose to believe anything. I'm compelled to believe something by sufficient justification. I cannot on a whim believe that the sky is neon magenta with black polkadots."" He's absolutely right. Belief isn’t a choice. You can’t just decide to believe something. You’re either convinced or you’re not. And nominal Christianity taught him that faith means choosing to believe without evidence, so when he realized he couldn’t do that, he assumed Christianity was false.

Nobody told him that’s not what biblical faith means. The Greek word pistis doesn’t mean ""belief without evidence."" It means trust, confidence, faithfulness, the kind of trust you’d have in a bridge that looks solid even though you haven’t personally tested every beam. Biblical faith is evidence-based trust. It’s not blind. It’s not irrational. It’s provisional trust based on good reasons while acknowledging you don’t have absolute certainty about everything.

But nominal Christians don’t know this. They don’t know their own theology. They certainly don’t know how to defend it. So when their kids ask hard questions, they get platitudes. ""Just have faith."" ""God works in mysterious ways."" ""You’ll understand when you’re older."" And then those kids grow up, leave home, meet people who actually have answers, atheist YouTubers, Muslim apologists, secular philosophers and they leave. Because the nominal Christianity they were raised in couldn’t answer their questions, couldn’t defend itself intellectually, and offered them nothing they couldn’t get elsewhere without the guilt and boring services.

The statistics bear this out. Barna found that 30% of people raised in Christian homes leave the faith by their mid-twenties. The number one reason is intellectual skepticism. Not ""the church hurt me,"" though that’s common too. Not ""I wanted to sin."" They left because they had questions and got terrible answers or no answers at all.

And you know what’s tragic? The answers exist. The evidence is there. We have a historically defensible faith with better manuscript evidence, earlier attestation, and more contemporary documentation than anything else from the ancient world. We have philosophical arguments that haven’t been refuted in 2,000 years. We have archaeological evidence, extrabiblical corroboration, and explanatory power that naturalism can’t match.

But nominal Christians don’t know any of this, so they can’t pass it on. They’re like people starving to death while sitting on a pantry full of food they don’t know how to open.

Here’s something that will make people uncomfortable: Muslims are eating our lunch intellectually, and they’re doing it because they take their faith seriously in ways we don’t.I’ve debated Muslims. I’ve watched Muslim apologists. And you know what? They know their stuff. They’ve read the Quran. They can quote hadith from memory. They know the seerah (the life of Muhammad ). They can articulate Islamic theology, defend Islamic ethics, and argue for the Quran’s authenticity with confidence.

Now, I think they’re wrong. I think Islam’s historical claims collapse under scrutiny, the Quran’s preservation narrative is demonstrably false, and Islamic law is incompatible with basic human rights. But at least they’re in the arena. At least they’re trying to make a case.

Compare that to the average Christian. How many Christians have read the entire Bible? How many can explain the doctrine of the Trinity without lapsing into heresy? How many know the difference between justification and sanctification? How many have even heard of the Nicene Creed?

The numbers are depressing. LifeWay Research found that only 45% of churchgoers read the Bible more than once a week outside of church. Twenty percent never read it at all. The State of Theology survey found that 52% of American Christians believe Jesus was a great teacher but not God. That’s not Christianity. That’s something else wearing Christianity’s skin.

Meanwhile, Muslims are confident. They’re having kids. They’re building mosques. They’re engaging in dawah, Islamic evangelism and they’re winning converts, especially among young Black men and disaffected former Christians who are looking for a faith that demands something from them.

All this while Islam is objectively worse on almost every metric. Women’s rights? Terrible. LGBT rights? Nonexistent. Freedom of conscience? You can be killed for leaving Islam. Democratic values? Incompatible with Sharia. Treatment of religious minorities? Dhimmi status at best, persecution at worst.But Muslims don’t apologize for it. They don’t water it down. They believe they’re right, and they act like it. And that confidence is attractive in a world where Christianity has become apologetic about its own existence.

We need to learn from that. Not the content, Islamic theology is deeply flawed but the confidence. The seriousness. The willingness to actually defend what we believe instead of either retreating into fundamentalist bunkers or progressively surrendering everything distinctive about our faith.

So what’s the alternative? What does Christianity look like if we reject both fundamentalism and progressivism, if we refuse to be nominal, if we actually take this seriously?

It starts with the resurrection. Everything and I mean everything hinges on this. If Jesus didn’t rise from the dead, Christianity is false. Period. No amount of nice ethics or beautiful liturgy or social justice activism changes that. Paul puts it bluntly: if Christ hasn’t been raised, our preaching is useless, our faith is useless, we’re still in our sins, and those who died believing in Christ are lost (1 Corinthians 15:14-18).

So let’s talk about the evidence, because contrary to what nominal Christians think, we have it.

First, the manuscript evidence. I mentioned this earlier, but it bears repeating: we have over 25,000 Greek manuscripts and fragments of the New Testament, dating from the second century onward. The earliest fragment, P52, a tiny piece of John’s Gospel dates to around 125 AD, maybe 30 years after John wrote it.

Compare that to other ancient texts we take for granted. Tacitus’s Annals, one of our best sources for Roman history, has two manuscripts, the oldest from 850 AD, 800 years after Tacitus wrote. Plato’s Republic? Seven manuscripts, the oldest from 895 AD, 1,200 years after Plato. The text of the New Testament is the best-attested ancient document in existence, and it’s not close.

Second, the early creed in 1 Corinthians 15:3-7. Paul writes, ""For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.""

This is a creed, a formalized statement of belief that predates Paul’s letter. Scholars date thiscreed to within 3 to 5 years of the crucifixion based on when Paul received it likely from Peter and James in Jerusalem around 35-36 AD and linguistic features in the Greek that suggest it was translated from Aramaic. Think about what that means. We're not talking about legends that developed over centuries. We're talking about testimony from within half a decade of the events, from people who claimed to be eyewitnesses. This is historical gold.

Third, the empty tomb. All four Gospels report it. Paul implies it in 1 Corinthians 15. Even hostile sources acknowledge it. Matthew's Gospel records that Jewish authorities claimed the disciples stole the body, which means they were arguing over why the tomb was empty, not whether it was empty. And here's the detail that convinced me the empty tomb tradition is authentic: the women. In first-century Jewish culture, women couldn't testify in court. Their testimony was considered unreliable. If you're inventing a resurrection story to convince first-century Jews, you don't make women your primary witnesses. You'd have Peter find the empty tomb, or John, or all the disciples together. The fact that the Gospels embarrass themselves with this detail is a strong indication they're reporting what actually happened, not what would be convenient.

Fourth, the appearances. Jesus appeared to individuals (Mary Magdalene, Peter), to small groups (the disciples), and to large groups (500 at once, according to Paul). He appeared to believers and to skeptics (Thomas). He appeared to enemies like Paul, who was actively persecuting Christians when Jesus appeared to him, and James (Jesus's brother) was skeptical until the resurrection. The hallucination theory doesn't work here. Hallucinations are individual experiences. They don't happen to groups. And they certainly don't convert enemies. If Paul was hallucinating, he'd see whatever confirmed his existing beliefs, probably a vision of God punishing the heretics. He wouldn't see Jesus appointing him as an apostle to the Gentiles.

Fifth, the transformation of the disciples. These were people who fled when Jesus was arrested, who denied knowing him, who hid behind locked doors after the crucifixion. Something turned them into bold proclaimers who were willing to die for their message. People die for lies they believe are true all the time. But people don't die for lies they know are lies. If the disciples stole the body and made up the resurrection, why would they die for it? Peter was crucified upside down. James son of Zebedee was beheaded. Thomas was speared to death in India. These aren't legends, these are traditions with early attestation. People don't maintain a conspiracy to the point of gruesome execution.

Even skeptical scholars accept most of these facts. The question isn't whether the disciples believed they saw Jesus alive, it's how to explain that belief. And every naturalistic explanation fails. Did they hallucinate? Can't explain the empty tomb or the group appearances. Did they steal the body? Can't explain why they'd die for a lie they invented. Was it legend? Can't explain the early dating of the creed or Paul's firsthand testimony. Was Jesus not really dead? Roman executioners were professionals. Plus, even if Jesus somehow survived (which is medically absurd), a half-dead man stumbling out of a tomb wouldn't convince anyone he'd conquered death. The resurrection is the best explanation. It accounts for all the data. It's what the evidence points to. But you'd never know that from most churches, because we've stopped teaching it.

If we're going to turn this around , and I'm not sure we can, but I'm angry enough to try here's what has to happen.

First, churches need to teach apologetics. Not as an optional class for nerds. As core curriculum. Every youth group should spend a year on the evidence for the resurrection. Every confirmation class should cover the reliability of the New Testament manuscripts. Every adult Sunday school should tackle the hard questions: suffering, hell, science, other religions. If we're not equipping people to defend their faith, we're sending them out as sheep among wolves.

Second, we need to read the Bible in context. That means understanding genre. Genesis 1-2 is ancient Near Eastern cosmology and theology, not modern science. The Psalms are poetry, not propositions. Revelation is apocalyptic literature, not a secret code for predicting the end times. We can take the Bible seriously without reading every word literally, because ""literal"" means reading something according to its genre and intent.

Third, we need intellectual honesty. That means admitting when we don't have all the answers. It means engaging with the best objections, not the straw men. It means reading books by people who disagree with us. It means being willing to change our minds when the evidence demands it.

Fourth, we need to stop being afraid of culture. Fundamentalists treat culture as the enemy to be fought. Progressives treat culture as the authority to be obeyed. Both are wrong. Culture is the mission field. We engage it, we critique it, we learn from it where it reflects truth, and we challenge it where it contradicts the gospel. But we don't run from it, and we don't surrender to it.

Fifth, we need to tell the truth about other religions. The Quran contains verses commanding violence (9:5, 9:29, 4:34). Islamic law is incompatible with human rights. That doesn't mean we hate Muslims, it means we love them enough to tell them the truth and offer them something better. The same goes for every other religion. Relativism isn't kindness. It's intellectual cowardice.

Sixth, we need to stop making Christianity a political identity. Jesus isn't a Republican. He's not a Democrat. The kingdom of God transcends American politics. Christians should engage politically, but our ultimate allegiance is to Christ, not to any party or candidate. When we conflate the two, we make Christianity into an idol and drive away everyone who doesn't share our politics.

Finally, we need to recover the supernatural. Christianity is a religion of miracles. The incarnation, the resurrection, the ascension, Pentecost, the second coming, these aren't metaphors. They're claims about reality. A Christianity without the supernatural is worthless because it has nothing to offer that secular humanism doesn't provide better.

I'm tired of watching people leave the faith after being given a false choice between mindless fundamentalism and meaningless progressivism. I'm tired of seeing nominal Christians who can't articulate what they believe. I'm tired of watching Islam gain ground because we're too scared or lazy to make our case. Christianity is true. Not ""true for me."" Not ""true in a metaphorical sense."" True. It makes claims about history, reality, and human nature that can be examined, tested, and defended.

But we have to do the work. We have to read, think, engage, and defend what we believe with gentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:15), but also with confidence and evidence. The West is dying spiritually. The church is hemorrhaging members. The next generation is walking away. We did this to ourselves by refusing to take our own faith seriously.

It's time to stop. It's time for serious Christianity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1q98qm2/christianity_is_killing_itself/,"Christianity is killing itself. 96 I need to get something off my chest, and I don't care if it makes people uncomfortable. I've spent most of my life in church, and I'm watching our faith kill itself. Not because of atheists. Not because of secular culture. Because of us. Because we've become so allergic to truth that we've replaced it with two dangerous alternatives: fundamentalist dogmatism on one side, progressive slush on the other, with a huge amount of nominal Christians in the middle who can't tell the difference and don't really care.

Let me tell you what I mean, because I'm not speaking in abstracts here. I'm talking about real churches, real people, real damage.

I grew up in a fundamentalist church where the pastor spent forty-five minutes every Sunday explaining why dinosaur bones were either Satan's deception or flood debris. I'm not exaggerating, this was presented as serious Christian doctrine. As if believing the earth is 6,000 years old was somehow a test of your faithfulness. As if God gave us brains and then expected us to leave them at the door.

The thing that drove me crazy then, and still drives me crazy now, is that these people genuinely think they're defending historic Christianity. They think they're the faithful remnant holding the line against modern corruption. But they're not. They're defending a version of Christianity that's barely a century old. The term ""fundamentalism"" itself only dates to 1920s America. Before that, you had Christians who believed all sorts of things about Genesis without anyone questioning their orthodoxy.

Saint Augustine, one of the most influential theologians in Christian history wrote in The Literal Meaning of Genesis around 415 AD that Christians who make absurd claims about the physical world based on Scripture bring shame to the faith. He said that when non-believers hear Christians contradicting observable reality, they assume everything else Christians say is nonsense too. And he wrote that in the fifth century, long before modern science gave us any reason to be defensive.

Origen read Genesis allegorically. So did Philo of Alexandria. The idea that Genesis 1-2 must be read as a literal, chronological, scientific account would have been foreign to many early Christians. They understood something fundamentalists have forgotten: the Bible is a library of books written in different genres, at different times, for different audiences. You can't read a psalm the same way you read a historical narrative. You can't read Revelation the same way you read Romans. Genre matters. Context matters. History matters.

But here's where fundamentalism becomes actively destructive, not just annoying. The resurrection. This is the hill Christianity lives or dies on. Paul couldn't be clearer in 1 Corinthians 15: if Christ hasn't been raised, our preaching is useless, our faith is useless, we're still in our sins, and those who died believing in Christ are lost. The resurrection is non-negotiable. It's the whole thing.

So how do fundamentalists defend it? Usually by yelling louder about faith and quoting Bible verses at skeptics. That's not apologetics. That's not even an argument. That's giving up before the fight starts. That's admitting you have no evidence and trying to make a virtue out of it.

Meanwhile, the actual evidence for the resurrection is staggering. We have better manuscript attestation for the New Testament than for any other document from antiquity, and it's not even close. Over 25,000 Greek manuscripts and fragments, plus thousands more in Latin, Coptic, Syriac, and other languages. The earliest fragment, P52, a tiny piece of John's Gospel dates to around 125 AD, maybe 30 years after John wrote it.

Compare that to other ancient texts we take for granted. Homer's Iliad, the second-best attested ancient work, has about 1,800 manuscripts. Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars, which we use as a primary source for Roman history, has ten manuscripts, and the oldest dates to 900 years after Caesar wrote it. For the New Testament, we have fragments within decades of the original composition. The text is the best-attested ancient document in existence.

This is a creed, a formalized statement of belief that predates Paul's letter. Scholars across the theological spectrum date this creed to within 3 to 5 years of the crucifixion, based on when Paul received it (likely from Peter and James in Jerusalem around 35-36 AD) and linguistic features in the Greek that suggest it was translated from Aramaic.Think about what that means. We're not talking about legends that developed over centuries. We're talking about testimony from within half a decade of the events, from people who claimed to be eyewitnesses. This is historical gold.

Even skeptical scholars accept the basic facts. Bart Ehrman, an agnostic who built his career on New Testament criticism, accepts that Jesus was crucified, that his followers believed they saw him alive afterward, and that even enemies like Paul and James converted based on these experiences. Gerd Lüdemann, an atheist scholar, calls the disciples' experiences ""historically certain."" The debate isn't whether something happened, it's how to explain what happened.

But fundamentalists don't present this evidence. They don't teach their kids that Christianity is defensible. They teach them that faith means believing without evidence, that doubt is sin, that asking questions is dangerous. So when those kids hit college and meet their first competent atheist, their faith collapses like a house of cards.

>

That blood is on fundamentalism's hands.

But the other side is just as guilty, just quieter about it.

Progressive Christianity looks different on the surface. It's welcoming, affirming, full of talk about love and justice and inclusion. The music is better. The sermons reference poetry and philosophy. But it's empty. Theologically empty. Spiritually empty. Progressive Christianity has managed to strip Christianity of everything that makes it Christian while still calling itself Christian. Listen to a progressive sermon and count how many minutes are spent on the resurrection as a historical event. Not as a metaphor for hope. Not as a symbol of transformation. As an actual thing that happened in real time and space, Jesus of Nazareth, executed by Rome, physically raised from the dead three days later.

You'll be lucky if it gets mentioned at all. And if it does, it'll be hedged with language about ""the experience of resurrection"" or ""resurrection as a way of being in the world."" Translation: we don't actually believe it happened, but we think the metaphor is nice.

This isn't an accident. Progressive Christianity is the end result of two centuries of liberal theology trying to make Christianity acceptable to modern people by cutting away everything modern people find offensive. Miracles? Gone. Virgin birth? Optional. Hell? Definitely gone. Exclusive truth claims? How dare you. What's left is a vague spirituality that sounds Christian because it uses Christian vocabulary but means something entirely different. Jesus isn't the incarnate Son of God who died for sins and rose from the dead. He's a wise teacher who was nice to marginalized people and got killed by the empire. Following Jesus doesn't mean repentance and faith. It means being nice and voting for the right politicians.

This version of Christianity has been tried. Mainline Protestantism went all-in on liberal theology in the mid-20th century. They questioned the supernatural, affirmed everything culture wanted them to affirm, focused on social justice, watered down doctrine to make it more palatable.

And they died.

If you're inventing a resurrection story to convince first-century Jews, you don't make women your primary witnesses. You'd have Peter find the empty tomb, or John, or all the disciples together. The fact that the Gospels embarrass themselves with this detail is a strong indication they're reporting what actually happened, not what would be convenient.

Fourth, the appearances. Jesus appeared to individuals (Mary Magdalene, Peter), to small groups (the disciples), and to large groups (500 at once, according to Paul). He appeared to believers and to skeptics (Thomas). He appeared to enemies like Paul, who was actively persecuting Christians when Jesus appeared to him, and James (Jesus's brother) was skeptical until the resurrection. The hallucination theory doesn't work here. Hallucinations are individual experiences. They don't happen to groups. And they certainly don't convert enemies. If Paul was hallucinating, he'd see whatever confirmed his existing beliefs, probably a vision of God punishing the heretics. He wouldn't see Jesus appointing him as an apostle to the Gentiles.

Fifth, the transformation of the disciples. These were people who fled when Jesus was arrested, who denied knowing him, who hid behind locked doors after the crucifixion. Something turned them into bold proclaimers who were willing to die for their message. People die for lies they believe are true all the time. But people don't die for lies they know are lies. If the disciples stole the body and made up the resurrection, why would they die for it? Peter was crucified upside down. James son of Zebedee was beheaded. Thomas was speared to death in India. These aren't legends, these are traditions with early attestation. People don't maintain a conspiracy to the point of gruesome execution.

Even skeptical scholars accept most of these facts. The question isn't whether the disciples believed they saw Jesus alive, it's how to explain that belief. And every naturalistic explanation fails. Did they hallucinate? Can't explain the empty tomb or the group appearances. Did they steal the body? Can't explain why they'd die for a lie they invented. Was it legend? Can't explain the early dating of the creed or Paul's firsthand testimony. Was Jesus not really dead? Roman executioners were professionals. Plus, even if Jesus somehow survived (which is medically absurd), a half-dead man stumbling out of a tomb wouldn't convince anyone he'd conquered death. The resurrection is the best explanation. It accounts for all the data. It's what the evidence points to. But you'd never know that from most churches, because we've stopped teaching it.

If we're going to turn this around , and I'm not sure we can, but I'm angry enough to try here's what has to happen.

First, churches need to teach apologetics. Not as an optional class for nerds. As core curriculum. Every youth group should spend a year on the evidence for the resurrection. Every confirmation class should cover the reliability of the New Testament manuscripts. Every adult Sunday school should tackle the hard questions: suffering, hell, science, other religions. If we're not equipping people to defend their faith, we're sending them out as sheep among wolves.

Second, we need to read the Bible in context. That means understanding genre. Genesis 1-2 is ancient Near Eastern cosmology and theology, not modern science. The Psalms are poetry, not propositions. Revelation is apocalyptic literature, not a secret code for predicting the end times. We can take the Bible seriously without reading every word literally, because ""literal"" means reading something according to its genre and intent.

Third, we need intellectual honesty. That means admitting when we don't have all the answers. It means engaging with the best objections, not the straw men. It means reading books by people who disagree with us. It means being willing to change our minds when the evidence demands it.

Fourth, we need to stop being afraid of culture. Fundamentalists treat culture as the enemy to be fought. Progressives treat culture as the authority to be obeyed. Both are wrong. Culture is the mission field. We engage it, we critique it, we learn from it where it reflects truth, and we challenge it where it contradicts the gospel. But we don't run from it, and we don't surrender to it.

Fifth, we need to tell the truth about other religions. The Quran contains verses commanding violence (9:5, 9:29, 4:34). Islamic law is incompatible with human rights. That doesn't mean we hate Muslims, it means we love them enough to tell them the truth and offer them something better. The same goes for every other religion. Relativism isn't kindness. It's intellectual cowardice.

Sixth, we need to stop making Christianity a political identity. Jesus isn't a Republican. He's not a Democrat. The kingdom of God transcends American politics. Christians should engage politically, but our ultimate allegiance is to Christ, not to any party or candidate. When we conflate the two, we make Christianity into an idol and drive away everyone who doesn't share our politics.

Finally, we need to recover the supernatural. Christianity is a religion of miracles. The incarnation, the resurrection, the ascension, Pentecost, the second coming, these aren't metaphors. They're claims about reality. A Christianity without the supernatural is worthless because it has nothing to offer that secular humanism doesn't provide better.

I'm tired of watching people leave the faith after being given a false choice between mindless fundamentalism and meaningless progressivism. I'm tired of seeing nominal Christians who can't articulate what they believe. I'm tired of watching Islam gain ground because we're too scared or lazy to make our case. Christianity is true. Not ""true for me."" Not ""true in a metaphorical sense."" True. It makes claims about history, reality, and human nature that can be examined, tested, and defended.

But we have to do the work. We have to read, think, engage, and defend what we believe with gentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:15), but also with confidence and evidence. The West is dying spiritually. The church is hemorrhaging members. The next generation is walking away. We did this to ourselves by refusing to take our own faith seriously.

It's time to stop. It's time for serious Christianity.",christianity is killing itself i need to get something off my chest and i don t care if it makes people uncomfortable i ve spent most of my life in church and i m watching our faith kill itself not because of atheists not because of secular culture because of us because we ve become so allergic to truth that we ve replaced it with two dangerous alternatives fundamentalist dogmatism on one side progressive slush on the other with a huge amount of nominal christians in the middle who can t tell the difference and don t really care let me tell you what i mean because i m not speaking in abstracts here i m talking about real churches real people real damage i grew up in a fundamentalist church where the pastor spent forty five minutes every sunday explaining why dinosaur bones were either satan s deception or flood debris i m not exaggerating this was presented as serious christian doctrine as if believing the earth is years old was somehow a test of your faithfulness as if god gave us brains and then expected us to leave them at the door the thing that drove me crazy then and still drives me crazy now is that these people genuinely think they re defending historic christianity they think they re the faithful remnant holding the line against modern corruption but they re not they re defending a version of christianity that s barely a century old the term fundamentalism itself only dates to s america before that you had christians who believed all sorts of things about genesis without anyone questioning their orthodoxy saint augustine one of the most influential theologians in christian history wrote in the literal meaning of genesis around ad that christians who make absurd claims about the physical world based on scripture bring shame to the faith he said that when non believers hear christians contradicting observable reality they assume everything else christians say is nonsense too and he wrote that in the fifth century long before modern science gave us any reason to be defensive origen read genesis allegorically so did philo of alexandria the idea that genesis must be read as a literal chronological scientific account would have been foreign to many early christians they understood something fundamentalists have forgotten the bible is a library of books written in different genres at different times for different audiences you can t read a psalm the same way you read a historical narrative you can t read revelation the same way you read romans genre matters context matters history matters but here s where fundamentalism becomes actively destructive not just annoying the resurrection this is the hill christianity lives or dies on paul couldn t be clearer in corinthians if christ hasn t been raised our preaching is useless our faith is useless we re still in our sins and those who died believing in christ are lost the resurrection is non negotiable it s the whole thing so how do fundamentalists defend it usually by yelling louder about faith and quoting bible verses at skeptics that s not apologetics that s not even an argument that s giving up before the fight starts that s admitting you have no evidence and trying to make a virtue out of it meanwhile the actual evidence for the resurrection is staggering we have better manuscript attestation for the new testament than for any other document from antiquity and it s not even close over greek manuscripts and fragments plus thousands more in latin coptic syriac and other languages the earliest fragment p a tiny piece of john s gospel dates to around ad maybe years after john wrote it compare that to other ancient texts we take for granted homer s iliad the second best attested ancient work has about manuscripts julius caesar s gallic wars which we use as a primary source for roman history has ten manuscripts and the oldest dates to years after caesar wrote it for the new testament we have fragments within decades of the original composition the text is the best attested ancient document in existence this is a creed a formalized statement of belief that predates paul s letter scholars across the theological spectrum date this creed to within to years of the crucifixion based on when paul received it likely from peter and james in jerusalem around ad and linguistic features in the greek that suggest it was translated from aramaic think about what that means we re not talking about legends that developed over centuries we re talking about testimony from within half a decade of the events from people who claimed to be eyewitnesses this is historical gold even skeptical scholars accept the basic facts bart ehrman an agnostic who built his career on new testament criticism accepts that jesus was crucified that his followers believed they saw him alive afterward and that even enemies like paul and james converted based on these experiences gerd l demann an atheist scholar calls the disciples experiences historically certain the debate isn t whether something happened it s how to explain what happened but fundamentalists don t present this evidence they don t teach their kids that christianity is defensible they teach them that faith means believing without evidence that doubt is sin that asking questions is dangerous so when those kids hit college and meet their first competent atheist their faith collapses like a house of cards that blood is on fundamentalism s hands but the other side is just as guilty just quieter about it progressive christianity looks different on the surface it s welcoming affirming full of talk about love and justice and inclusion the music is better the sermons reference poetry and philosophy but it s empty theologically empty spiritually empty progressive christianity has managed to strip christianity of everything that makes it christian while still calling itself christian listen to a progressive sermon and count how many minutes are spent on the resurrection as a historical event not as a metaphor for hope not as a symbol of transformation as an actual thing that happened in real time and space jesus of nazareth executed by rome physically raised from the dead three days later you ll be lucky if it gets mentioned at all and if it does it ll be hedged with language about the experience of resurrection or resurrection as a way of being in the world translation we don t actually believe it happened but we think the metaphor is nice this isn t an accident progressive christianity is the end result of two centuries of liberal theology trying to make christianity acceptable to modern people by cutting away everything modern people find offensive miracles gone virgin birth optional hell definitely gone exclusive truth claims how dare you what s left is a vague spirituality that sounds christian because it uses christian vocabulary but means something entirely different jesus isn t the incarnate son of god who died for sins and rose from the dead he s a wise teacher who was nice to marginalized people and got killed by the empire following jesus doesn t mean repentance and faith it means being nice and voting for the right politicians this version of christianity has been tried mainline protestantism went all in on liberal theology in the mid th century they questioned the supernatural affirmed everything culture wanted them to affirm focused on social justice watered down doctrine to make it more palatable and they died these are denominations in demographic freefall and the excuse is always the same everyone s leaving church it s just secularization except that s not true conservative denominations that hold to historic christian doctrine are growing or holding steady non denominational evangelical churches are packed orthodox christianity in america is growing the churches that are dying are the ones that decided to be more like the world progressive christianity offers nothing you can t get from secular humanism without the hassle if jesus is just a good moral teacher why bother with church when you can sleep in and read marcus aurelius if christianity is just about being a decent person and fighting for justice why not cut out the middleman and join a nonprofit the only reason to be christian is if christianity is true not metaphorically true not true for you actually historically objectively true if jesus didn t really rise from the dead paul was right we should be pitied above all people because we re wasting our time but progressive christianity can t say christianity is uniquely true because that would mean other religions are false and that s too mean so they retreat into relativism all paths lead to god jesus is one way among many we re all just trying our best and that s where it gets really galling because progressive christians are very selective about which religions they re willing to criticize they ll write endless think pieces about how white evangelicals are complicit in american empire they ll call out the catholic church s sex abuse scandals and they should but ask them about islam and suddenly it s all we must respect diverse faith traditions meanwhile in islamic theocratic countries women face severe restrictions apostates are executed homosexuals are persecuted girls have their genitals mutilated honor killings occur where are the progressive christian marches for them where s the outrage it s nowhere because calling out islam would require acknowledging that some cultures and religions are worse than others and that violates the progressive commitment to relativism better to focus on safe targets fundamentalists conservatives people who won t literally kill you for criticizing them this is moral cowardice dressed up as compassion and it makes me sick but here s the dirty secret neither fundamentalists nor progressives are the biggest problem they re loud they re visible they get all the attention but they re small minorities the real problem is nominalism the vast middle ground of people who call themselves christian but don t actually believe or practice much of anything they show up on christmas and easter they like the aesthetic they think jesus was probably a good guy they might pray occasionally when things get bad but they can t articulate what they believe they haven t read the bible in years if ever they couldn t defend the resurrection to save their lives they ve never heard of the church fathers they think faith means believing something without evidence which is exactly what atheists think it means and exactly why atheists reject it this is the christianity that many ex christians were raised in one atheist commenter i encountered said i can t consciously choose to believe anything i m compelled to believe something by sufficient justification i cannot on a whim believe that the sky is neon magenta with black polkadots he s absolutely right belief isn t a choice you can t just decide to believe something you re either convinced or you re not and nominal christianity taught him that faith means choosing to believe without evidence so when he realized he couldn t do that he assumed christianity was false nobody told him that s not what biblical faith means the greek word pistis doesn t mean belief without evidence it means trust confidence faithfulness the kind of trust you d have in a bridge that looks solid even though you haven t personally tested every beam biblical faith is evidence based trust it s not blind it s not irrational it s provisional trust based on good reasons while acknowledging you don t have absolute certainty about everything but nominal christians don t know this they don t know their own theology they certainly don t know how to defend it so when their kids ask hard questions they get platitudes just have faith god works in mysterious ways you ll understand when you re older and then those kids grow up leave home meet people who actually have answers atheist youtubers muslim apologists secular philosophers and they leave because the nominal christianity they were raised in couldn t answer their questions couldn t defend itself intellectually and offered them nothing they couldn t get elsewhere without the guilt and boring services the statistics bear this out barna found that of people raised in christian homes leave the faith by their mid twenties the number one reason is intellectual skepticism not the church hurt me though that s common too not i wanted to sin they left because they had questions and got terrible answers or no answers at all and you know what s tragic the answers exist the evidence is there we have a historically defensible faith with better manuscript evidence earlier attestation and more contemporary documentation than anything else from the ancient world we have philosophical arguments that haven t been refuted in years we have archaeological evidence extrabiblical corroboration and explanatory power that naturalism can t match but nominal christians don t know any of this so they can t pass it on they re like people starving to death while sitting on a pantry full of food they don t know how to open here s something that will make people uncomfortable muslims are eating our lunch intellectually and they re doing it because they take their faith seriously in ways we don t i ve debated muslims i ve watched muslim apologists and you know what they know their stuff they ve read the quran they can quote hadith from memory they know the seerah the life of muhammad they can articulate islamic theology defend islamic ethics and argue for the quran s authenticity with confidence now i think they re wrong i think islam s historical claims collapse under scrutiny the quran s preservation narrative is demonstrably false and islamic law is incompatible with basic human rights but at least they re in the arena at least they re trying to make a case compare that to the average christian how many christians have read the entire bible how many can explain the doctrine of the trinity without lapsing into heresy how many know the difference between justification and sanctification how many have even heard of the nicene creed the numbers are depressing lifeway research found that only of churchgoers read the bible more than once a week outside of church twenty percent never read it at all the state of theology survey found that of american christians believe jesus was a great teacher but not god that s not christianity that s something else wearing christianity s skin meanwhile muslims are confident they re having kids they re building mosques they re engaging in dawah islamic evangelism and they re winning converts especially among young black men and disaffected former christians who are looking for a faith that demands something from them all this while islam is objectively worse on almost every metric women s rights terrible lgbt rights nonexistent freedom of conscience you can be killed for leaving islam democratic values incompatible with sharia treatment of religious minorities dhimmi status at best persecution at worst but muslims don t apologize for it they don t water it down they believe they re right and they act like it and that confidence is attractive in a world where christianity has become apologetic about its own existence we need to learn from that not the content islamic theology is deeply flawed but the confidence the seriousness the willingness to actually defend what we believe instead of either retreating into fundamentalist bunkers or progressively surrendering everything distinctive about our faith so what s the alternative what does christianity look like if we reject both fundamentalism and progressivism if we refuse to be nominal if we actually take this seriously it starts with the resurrection everything and i mean everything hinges on this if jesus didn t rise from the dead christianity is false period no amount of nice ethics or beautiful liturgy or social justice activism changes that paul puts it bluntly if christ hasn t been raised our preaching is useless our faith is useless we re still in our sins and those who died believing in christ are lost corinthians so let s talk about the evidence because contrary to what nominal christians think we have it first the manuscript evidence i mentioned this earlier but it bears repeating we have over greek manuscripts and fragments of the new testament dating from the second century onward the earliest fragment p a tiny piece of john s gospel dates to around ad maybe years after john wrote it compare that to other ancient texts we take for granted tacitus s annals one of our best sources for roman history has two manuscripts the oldest from ad years after tacitus wrote plato s republic seven manuscripts the oldest from ad years after plato the text of the new testament is the best attested ancient document in existence and it s not close second the early creed in corinthians paul writes for what i received i passed on to you as of first importance that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that he appeared to cephas and then to the twelve this is a creed a formalized statement of belief that predates paul s letter scholars date thiscreed to within to years of the crucifixion based on when paul received it likely from peter and james in jerusalem

64,Critique my proposal to Improving tax system,1q97jzl,IndiaTax,0,0,2026-01-10 15:54:25,_anonimuz,"Let's start by a simple question which I hope you really do answer.

**""If you are provided 100rs and you HAVE (can't keep it in your pocket) to invest in a state for development which one would it be ?"" - the choice MUST comply with condition 1 of CDT below.**  
 **For answer, provide what state you are native of, residing in and your CDT choice.**

Consider me a novice as I have only recently started to learn more about the Indian tax system and its history. (I'm still a student and will become a salaried tax-payer hopefully this year :) )

I of-course am here to learn and would like to learn from voices of people (before I jump into it with a chatbot). So please be a constructive critique and help

    Indian states receive a significant portion of their funding from taxpayer money, which comes through a combination of their own state-level taxes, a mandated share of central government taxes, and grants-in-aid from the central government.

I was just thinking on ideas to improve the system after reviewing previously posted similar queries. Goals being :

* improve responsibility of tax-payer so they start asking more questions and results from govt
* possibly improve transparency with tight conditions so that RTI on it will NOT be revoked as it'll be taxpayer's right
* force tax-payers to think about ""India"" and not just the state or city they live in

**Proposal**

Every tax payer (or maybe those above the 12LPA bracket - essentially to initially focus the bracket of population that has exposure to nationwide activities and are educated or knowledgeable) will control where 30/40 percent of their annual tax must be used in. Let's call this tax ""Civic Duty Tax(CDT)""

Conditions below :

1. They must choose to invest CDT in a state that does **NOT** fall under the below
   1. the birth-native state
   2. the current resident state (residing for more than 3/5 years)
   3. the state the person holds a voter card of
   4. OPTIONALLY, the person may decide to further choose a scheme or project of the chosen state to invest in as a recommendation to the state. The money invested MUST be in the form of CDBC for better tracking and transparency
   5. A person may not repeat the choice of state for CDT more that 3/2 consecutive years
2. If a state does get over provisioned by CDT, the Finance Ministry MUST re-distribute it to maintain balance but MUST also consider the choice of the tax payers in terms of amount and no.of taxypayers
3. CDT system MUST be transparent and completely under RTI so that any tax-payer of citizen may exercise his right to follow what happened to their CDBC and what's the result on that invested-in scheme/project
4. Eventually maybe, for high-taxpyers, NOT choosing a state for their CDT will result in a penalty

I was just thinking of how can we force people to think about India as a whole and not just their immediate vicinity or state ? Also to further grow inter-state investments and interactions -- to accelerate growth in India in a distributed manner

Of course there will be corruption, but would a slightly more distributed corruption (hopefully being monitored more strictly due to CDBC) be better than current situation ?

If such a system was to be built and you like the direction of it, how would you improve it ? ( to ensure the civic responsibility, transparency in the system and accountability of the central and state govt)

Are there any larger impact or consequences I have failed to think about ?

If you do not like the idea, why so ? what would you rather have ? or would you have NO change at all ?

p.s If people were to ask for a change in the system, how would they actually go about it in India legally ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaTax/comments/1q97jzl/critique_my_proposal_to_improving_tax_system/,"Critique my proposal to Improving tax system 0 Let's start by a simple question which I hope you really do answer.

**""If you are provided 100rs and you HAVE (can't keep it in your pocket) to invest in a state for development which one would it be ?"" - the choice MUST comply with condition 1 of CDT below.**  
 **For answer, provide what state you are native of, residing in and your CDT choice.**

Consider me a novice as I have only recently started to learn more about the Indian tax system and its history. (I'm still a student and will become a salaried tax-payer hopefully this year :) )

I of-course am here to learn and would like to learn from voices of people (before I jump into it with a chatbot). So please be a constructive critique and help

    Indian states receive a significant portion of their funding from taxpayer money, which comes through a combination of their own state-level taxes, a mandated share of central government taxes, and grants-in-aid from the central government.

I was just thinking on ideas to improve the system after reviewing previously posted similar queries. Goals being :

* improve responsibility of tax-payer so they start asking more questions and results from govt
* possibly improve transparency with tight conditions so that RTI on it will NOT be revoked as it'll be taxpayer's right
* force tax-payers to think about ""India"" and not just the state or city they live in

**Proposal**

Every tax payer (or maybe those above the 12LPA bracket - essentially to initially focus the bracket of population that has exposure to nationwide activities and are educated or knowledgeable) will control where 30/40 percent of their annual tax must be used in. Let's call this tax ""Civic Duty Tax(CDT)""

Conditions below :

1. They must choose to invest CDT in a state that does **NOT** fall under the below
   1. the birth-native state
   2. the current resident state (residing for more than 3/5 years)
   3. the state the person holds a voter card of
   4. OPTIONALLY, the person may decide to further choose a scheme or project of the chosen state to invest in as a recommendation to the state. The money invested MUST be in the form of CDBC for better tracking and transparency
   5. A person may not repeat the choice of state for CDT more that 3/2 consecutive years
2. If a state does get over provisioned by CDT, the Finance Ministry MUST re-distribute it to maintain balance but MUST also consider the choice of the tax payers in terms of amount and no.of taxypayers
3. CDT system MUST be transparent and completely under RTI so that any tax-payer of citizen may exercise his right to follow what happened to their CDBC and what's the result on that invested-in scheme/project
4. Eventually maybe, for high-taxpyers, NOT choosing a state for their CDT will result in a penalty

65,Finally Read the Darn Comic,1q96gde,PoorAzula,24,33,2026-01-10 15:10:30,SmileFiles,"Hey! Decided to finally post after being a lurker. I finally read the transcript for *Ashes of the Academy* via the wiki. Here are my thoughts as I skimmed the transcript:

\- This is a baby franchise for babies. I must have grown up, because I felt like I was reading something for an early grade-schooler. No serious discussions of fascism, colonization, indoctrination, gender roles and how they tie to honor, the fact that Zuko seemingly let all the bad people off scot-free and is holding onto absolute power just like his father (Zuko is the ""good authoritarian""), etc. That said, I will still happily beat the drum that the portrayal of mental illness as it pertains to Azula is ableist and misogynistic and has no place in a franchise for children, as I think her treatment by the narrative and the fandom stands in stark contrast to the themes of redemption, healing, and forgiveness this franchise ""claims"" to tout.

\-  If they wanted to make Ursa more unlikable, they succeeded. Zuko and Ursa are so passive that they are good by default, as they merely react to evil agitators that break the status quo (which got problematic when the agitator was the untreated mentally ill teen with zero support network who cannot control her episodes in the previous comics). It's depressing that Zuko can't directly acknowledge that the school might have shaped his sister. I also don't like the subtle misogyny where Ursa says ""I don't want my innocent and pure Kiyi to go here and become corrupted like bad seed Azula, who I am not responsible for"", and Zuko as the patriarch of the family (in a sort of traditional Confucian sense where the first born male is head of the household) tells her ""Well, I get final say in Kiyi's education"" (basically), and Ursa goes ""I will learn to accept your judgement, son"" (basically). ""Brought out the worst in her"" to me implies that Ursa believes that Azula was born bad, then made worse. She wants to play perfect mom, yet claim she was powerless to stop Azula from turning rotten, by both external factors and Azula's supposed inherent vileness. And yes, Kiyi was a shameless prize for Zuko as a reward for being a goodie good boy so he could be allowed to forget his troubled sister.

\- Letting commoners into the school is so vague. Which commoners get to go? The ones with high marks, the ones in the zip code of the school? 100% the rich kids would either get pulled out of the school entirely, or they would bully the crap out of the poor kids. (See the entire online debate about the reservation system in India and how too deeply ingrained casteism is, or look at the fierce opposition to forced bussing or public school funding in the US).

\- Zuko has crazy plot armor. If he is trying to force the families to reconcile with the crimes during the war, it's a losing battle. Just look at how Japan in real life still struggles to acknowledge the war crimes. The noble families (that he forgot to punish/strip the power of like in real life) would ABSOLUTELY just organize to overthrow/kill him. Azula was already proven correct in *Smoke and Shadow* that Zuko is such a weak leader. Remember how he basically starved himself and turned into a tyrant at the drop of a hat (but it's cool when men don't sleep, and throw tantrums, and dismiss people trying to help him I GUESS /s)?

\- I thought this was a military school. They really could have benefited from researching the history of schools in Japan. These writers would be HORRIFIED to know that it is still to this day teachers strike children (even if it was recently ruled illegal to do so). Furthermore, there is a documentary of Japanese schools (2024 ""The Making of a Japanese"" which I think would have helped (they came out the same year I know, but there's plenty of material they could have looked at). Bullying is also commonplace enough that the bad cases hit the news. And furthermore, I don't understand this ""the school used to teach fear"" narrative when more so schools in Asia teach cohesion and unity (at times at the expense of the individual), and obedience/respect to authority/elders. My point is that Azula isn't unique or especially cruel. I wish they showed the school to be hyper competitive, balancing creating a cohesive unit with shining as the star pupil. Show the horrors of bullying and violence being swept under the rug. Show teachers looking away or punishing the weak/those who can't fit in. Show that the other girls were also a bunch of baby Azulas.

\- Why is Zuko personally writing the school curriculum? He's not a teacher. In fact, I don't think his education has ever been made clear (missed opportunity to show boys his age ALSO acting like a bunch of Azulas in his school, if he even attended school). This is a general problem in fiction where the King of the country for some reason gets sent on fetch quests and for some reason can be an authority on ALL disciplines.

\- OMG, Kiyi would have been humiliated, slapped, and forced to clean the classroom for talking back to the teacher. No little kid has a speech on historical revisionism on the ready. Not only that, I think the entire class would bully her for saying that they were the bad guys in the war (these kids would have lost close family in the war, would be angry). She's setting herself up to be completely socially isolated from her peers. It's almost as if there's more complexity to this issue that a sassy speech alone can't fix! And if the teachers are just too scared of angering Zuko, then that just proves my point that Zuko is just a rehash of his father. Wait, didn't Zuko tell Azula in a previous comic that she was wrong to talk back to a teacher by pulling rank(because the teacher wanted her to learn something), but then Kiyi can talk back to a teacher and basically take over the entire class by pulling rank too? (Lemme be clear, the Fire Nation are the bad guys, I'm pointing out a double standard). He should have just swapped out all the teachers for re-educated teachers that would have been drilled to teach the correct curriculum to avoid the scenario entirely.

\- How is Zuko so dense as to not be aware that peasants are treated poorly? He went through 3 seasons of that! Not to mention, HE was the one who used to use ""peasant"" like it was a slur. Again, no one would take the word of a tiny child over the esteemed headmistress of the school. She may be a princess, but the instructors are there to teach her and all the students to obey adults without question. Zuko is in a fight against an entire cultural framework, which probably would fight against him if he didn't have such strong plot armor.

\- Zuko proving himself as ultimate BF material by telling Mai that she has to now be an elementary school teacher (she can't say no to the Fire Lord). No misogyny there at all, no siree \\s. Also yeah, he still seems ambivalent towards his sister, which I get that she abused him, but at this point, IMO, the roles have switched and he was supposed to have matured as a person. IMO, he hasn't, he's just continued to fail upwards. Also, like, Zuko can just fire the headmistress instead of doing this nepotism/cronyism plot. Furthermore, Mai appears to have no teaching experience (Did Zuko just assume a woman would naturally be good with kids?). The parents would be quick to pull their kids out of a school where all they do is look at cicadas. Also, Zuko is proven correct that Mai would like teaching, which considering that he ordered her to teach gives me an ick.

\- Mai: ""We don't need to teach stinky politics or math because we lost the war. It's better to stare at bugs instead.""

\- I think Ukano's speech of be strong or be trampled actually is proven correct in the text considering that Zuko overthrew his father and sister by force.

\- I hate that Azula is seen as evil for being cunning but other characters who use direct, brute force are seen as ""misguided patriots"", as if direct war is not as evil as underhanded tactics.

\- I like how Mai and Azula first met, I wish that Mai used to like Azula more so there's more emotional conflict. But nah, Azula is a bad seed, remember?

\- Like Katara, Mai has been relegated to GF, but is too sassy to admit it. Which in terms of writing a female character is unfortunate when we all know that she'll just do as he says (like teach), marry him, and have his kid one day.

\- Now this is neat. Mai says that Azula was ""terrifying and cruel"", but also that she stayed because Azula made Mai feel like she ""mattered"". I wish they SHOWED this second part OMG. Considering that Mai eventually betrays her! Later, she blames the school for making Azula so paranoid that she banished people, which deflects her own responsibility, but I think Faith wants us to see that Mai doesn't 100% blame Azula (I think this is still done poorly).

\- Lol, when Kiyi asks why she was kidnapped, Mai says that even Azula might not know why she did that. Okay, I think I see what Faith is trying to do. The *Smoke and Shadow* reasoning was egregiously sexist (Azula wanted to lose her identity for her brother, a man, and to be a shadowy temptress that orders him to do evil so she could feel like a leader, which I guess women aren't allowed to be /s). I think this is supposed to be a step in the direction that Mai will open up to being friends with Azula again. The tone in this comic seems to be that Azula is a lost soul that the cast is just clueless to help. The cast is critical of her, but nothing suggests that she is firmly dead to them. I hate that this means likely that when Azula inevitably (sorry antis, it's gonna happen) gets a redemption, it'll either be in the vein of ""I, Azula, was 100% wrong, and I'm ready to submit to Zuko as Fire Lord and let the cast feel zero remorse for how they treated me"", or she's going to go on a vague journey to ""find herself"", with the blessing of her family, who again can feel morally smug that they caused her no harm and she's out of their hair. I think the authors are fence-sitters afraid of upsetting the part of the fandom that wants to see Azula as irredeemable.

\- Reading the Agni kai scene, these authors don't understand honor. See above. Again, the fear thing is antithetical to how a school that teaches hierarchy works. Not to mention that historically, only boys were encouraged to fight in school physically.

\- The entire Dai Li plot is dumb. I love that it's so dumb that Azula isn't even involved. IDK what Faith says, this is TOTALLY a meta-commentary on her fans and how we're dorks waiting for validation. This story also suffers from everything being controlled by the same, like 4 people. There's no sense of scale or community or even just staff in this empty school.

\- Ty Lee once again, contributes nothing.

\- Nothing notable happens in this comic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoorAzula/comments/1q96gde/finally_read_the_darn_comic/,"Finally Read the Darn Comic 33 Hey!

kid has a speech on historical revisionism on the ready not only that i think the entire class would bully her for saying that they were the bad guys in the war these kids would have lost close family in the war would be angry she s setting herself up to be completely socially isolated from her peers it s almost as if there s more complexity to this issue that a sassy speech alone can t fix and if the teachers are just too scared of angering zuko then that just proves my point that zuko is just a rehash of his father wait didn t zuko tell azula in a previous comic that she was wrong to talk back to a teacher by pulling rank because the teacher wanted her to learn something but then kiyi can talk back to a teacher and basically take over the entire class by pulling rank too lemme be clear the fire nation are the bad guys i m pointing out a double standard he should have just swapped out all the teachers for re educated teachers that would have been drilled to teach the correct curriculum to avoid the scenario entirely how is zuko so dense as to not be aware that peasants are treated poorly he went through seasons of that not to mention he was the one who used to use peasant like it was a slur again no one would take the word of a tiny child over the esteemed headmistress of the school she may be a princess but the instructors are there to teach her and all the students to obey adults without question zuko is in a fight against an entire cultural framework which probably would fight against him if he didn t have such strong plot armor zuko proving himself as ultimate bf material by telling mai that she has to now be an elementary school teacher she can t say no to the fire lord no misogyny there at all no siree s also yeah he still seems ambivalent towards his sister which i get that she abused him but at this point imo the roles have switched and he was supposed to have matured as a person imo he hasn t he s just continued to fail upwards also like zuko can just fire the headmistress instead of doing this nepotism cronyism plot furthermore mai appears to have no teaching experience did zuko just assume a woman would naturally be good with kids the parents would be quick to pull their kids out of a school where all they do is look at cicadas also zuko is proven correct that mai would like teaching which considering that he ordered her to teach gives me an ick mai we don t need to teach stinky politics or math because we lost the war it s better to stare at bugs instead i think ukano s speech of be strong or be trampled actually is proven correct in the text considering that zuko overthrew his father and sister by force i hate that azula is seen as evil for being cunning but other characters who use direct brute force are seen as misguided patriots as if direct war is not as evil as underhanded tactics i like how mai and azula first met i wish that mai used to like azula more so there s more emotional conflict but nah azula is a bad seed remember like katara mai has been relegated to gf but is too sassy to admit it which in terms of writing a female character is unfortunate when we all know that she ll just do as he says like teach marry him and have his kid one day now this is neat mai says that azula was terrifying and cruel but also that she stayed because azula made mai feel like she mattered i wish they showed this second part omg considering that mai eventually betrays her later she blames the school for making azula so paranoid that she banished people which deflects her own responsibility but i think faith wants us to see that mai doesn t blame azula i think this is still done poorly lol when kiyi asks why she was kidnapped mai says that even azula might not know why she did that okay i think i see what faith is trying to do the smoke and shadow reasoning was egregiously sexist azula wanted to lose her identity for her brother a man and to be a shadowy temptress that orders him to do evil so she could feel like a leader which i guess women aren t allowed to be s i think this is supposed to be a step in the direction that mai will open up to being friends with azula again the tone in this comic seems to be that azula is a lost soul that the cast is just clueless to help the cast is critical of her but nothing suggests that she is firmly dead to them i hate that this means likely that when azula inevitably sorry antis it s gonna happen gets a redemption it ll either be in the vein of i azula was wrong and i m ready to submit to zuko as fire lord and let the cast feel zero remorse for how they treated me or she s going to go on a vague journey to find herself with the blessing of her family who again can feel morally smug that they caused her no harm and she s out of their hair i think the authors are fence sitters afraid of upsetting the part of the fandom that wants to see azula as irredeemable reading the agni kai scene these authors don t understand honor see above again the fear thing is antithetical to how a school that teaches hierarchy works not to mention that historically only boys were encouraged to fight in school physically the entire dai li plot is dumb i love that it s so dumb that azula isn t even involved idk what faith says this is totally a meta commentary on her fans and how we re dorks waiting for validation this story also suffers from everything being controlled by the same like people there s no sense of scale or community or even just staff in this empty school ty lee once again contributes nothing nothing notable happens in this

Great. Here are MY questions. Answer these first, then ask for votes.

**CRIME AGAINST WOMEN:**

121 rapes in first 2 months of 2025 - our own Chief Minister admitted this in the Assembly on March 3, 2025. That's 2 rapes PER DAY in our state. Over 40,000 rape cases since 2021 (CM's statement August 2024). Assam recorded the HIGHEST crime rate against women in entire India in 2021 - 168.3 per lakh population, more than double the national average of 64.5 (NCRB Crime in India Report 2021).

our government admitted these numbers yourself. So where's the solution? You promised women's safety. Where is it?

**What happened to:**

* Fast-track courts you promised?
* The Dhing gang rape case where accused ""drowned while escaping""?
* That 16-year-old from Jorhat threatened with acid and deepfaked?
* Protection for minors when 10% of rape victims are children?

**INFRASTRUCTURE PROMISES:**

You promised development. Where is it?

* Roads still flood every monsoon
* Drainage systems that actually drain water
* Jobs for our youth who have degrees but no employment

**CORRUPTION:**

Coal syndicates. Sand syndicates. Land grabbing. Basundhara scheme benefits going to ministers' families while poor people wait.

Who got arrested? Who got punished? Or is it just opposition making noise?

**WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANT:**

Stop the wall paintings. Stop the slogans. Answer us:

1. Why is crime against women RISING under your government?
2. Where are the jobs you promised youth?
3. Why do our streets still flood?
4. When will rapists actually get punished fast?
5. What about the 15-25% commission contractors admit they pay?

Elections mean you need OUR votes. So answer OUR questions first.

Don't tell us what you'll do. Tell us what you DID with the last 5 years we gave you.

**To Assam Youth:** Elections are in our hands now. Don't just vote because your family always voted for someone. Question them. Attend rallies and ASK these questions loudly. Force them to answer.

68,"If Pollution Triggers Another Corona-Level Plague in India, How Do We ""Survive""? (Spoiler: We Won't, But Let's Pretend We Can With Some Dark Humor and Political BS)",1q92zz5,u_priyanshuuonlyy,1,0,2026-01-10 12:36:08,priyanshuuonlyy,"Hey fellow smog-breathers of us
Lately, I've been hacking up a lung every morning, and it's not from that pack of Gold Flake I quit (or so I tell myself). Everyone around me is coughing like they've got a perpetual Diwali cracker stuck in their throat. Delhi's AQI is flirting with 500 again, Mumbai's turning into a real-life Gotham with zero Batman, and Bangalore's ""garden city"" vibe is more like ""garbage city"" now. I don't know why we've all been coughing for days—wait, yes I do: it's the pollution, you idiots. But let's dive deeper, shall we? Using my armchair expertise in psychology, politics, and a healthy dose of dark humor, let's speculate on what happens if this toxic air cocktail brews up another Corona 2.0. Because why not? We're all doomed anyway.
Psychological Angle: The Denial Dance
First off, psychologically, Indians are masters of cognitive dissonance. We've got that ""chalta hai"" mentality wired into our brains like a faulty neuron. Remember Corona? We went from ""It's just a flu, bro"" to hoarding Remdesivir overnight. If pollution sparks a new respiratory apocalypse—let's call it ""Smogvid-26""—we'll start with denial: ""Arre, it's just allergies from the changing weather!"" (Said while the sky is orange and your eyes are watering like you've been onion-chopped by life itself).
Freud would call this repression; we'd rather bury our heads in polluted sand than admit our collective inaction. And the survivor's guilt? Oh boy. The rich will jet off to their Swiss chalets, while the rest of us mutate into human air purifiers. Dark humor twist: Imagine evolving gills to breathe underwater because the air's too thick—except we'd drown in the Yamuna first. Psychologically, survival tip #1: Develop Stockholm syndrome with your pollution. Love the smog that kidnaps your lungs; it'll hurt less.
Political Deep Dive: The Blame Game Bonanza
Politically, this is a goldmine for finger-pointing. Our netas have turned pollution into a partisan sport. BJP blames stubble-burning farmers (code for ""Punjab opposition""), Congress points at industrial cronyism (code for ""Modi's buddies""), and AAP just tweets about odd-even while Kejriwal wears a mask that looks suspiciously like a campaign prop. Deep knowledge drop: India's environmental policies are a joke wrapped in bureaucracy. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is underfunded AF—allocated like 0.01% of GDP while we spend billions on statues and temples. Why? Because votes come from jingoism, not clean air.
If Smogvid hits, the government will declare a ""national emergency"" (read: excuse to impose more curbs on dissent). Survival strategy? Join a political party. BJP folks get priority oxygen tanks from ""donors,"" Congress gets legacy ventilators from the Nehru era, and independents? Well, you're on your own, breathing through a wet cloth like it's 2020 all over again. Dark humor alert: Imagine Modi ji addressing the nation: ""Mitron, this new virus is anti-national. But don't worry, we've launched a scheme—'Atmanirbhar Asphyxiation'—where you learn to hold your breath for 5 minutes. Sabka Saath, Sabka Suffocation!""
How Do We ""Survive""? (Real Talk with Dark Twists)
Mask Up, But Make It Fashion: Corona taught us masks are life. But with pollution, we'll need N99s that filter out PM2.5 and political hot air. Psych tip: Wear one with a smiley face to delude yourself into happiness. Dark humor: If you can't afford it, just use your Aadhaar card—it's got your face on it anyway, and the government's already tracking your every breath.
Migrate Internally: Head to the hills? Himachal or Uttarakhand might seem clean, but wait till climate refugees turn them into mini-Delhis. Political insight: This will spark interstate wars over water and air rights—Karnataka vs. Tamil Nadu 2.0, but with cough syrup rations. Survival hack: Become a nomad yogi; breathe pranayama until you transcend the need for oxygen.
Economic Darwinism: The poor will suffer most—slum dwellers already have black lungs from factory fumes. Deep politics: India's inequality (Gini coefficient ~0.35, but feels like 0.9) means the elite survive via private jets and imported air. Dark twist: Natural selection favors the corrupt; they've got thicker skins (and Swiss bank accounts) to buy bunkers. Us normies? We'll ""adapt"" by developing superpowers like coughing up policy critiques.
The Ultimate Cope: Humor and Therapy: Psychologically, laughter is the best medicine—until your lungs collapse. So, meme it out: ""Pollution so bad, even the virus is wearing a mask."" But seriously, if this happens, therapy sessions will boom. ""Tell me, how does the smog make you feel?"" ""Invisible, doc. Like my vote in a democracy.""
In conclusion, if another Corona-like bimari drops because of this pollution, we won't survive—we'll ""Indian-ize"" it: improvise, complain, and somehow limp on until the next crisis. But hey, at least we'll have killer dark humor stories for the afterlife. What do you think, redditors? Share your survival tips below, or just cough in agreement.
TL;DR: Coughing epidemic? Blame pollution. New plague? Blame politics. Survival? LOL, good luck.

85,Assessing Cult Characteristics: The Dawoodi Bohra Community,1q9o0kx,exBohra,0,2,2026-01-11 03:00:52,Bitter_Departure7629,"**Introduction**

The Dawoodi Bohras are a sub-sect of Isma’ili Shia Islam with roughly one million followers worldwide. Historically centered in Gujarat (India) and now spread across South Asia, the Middle East, East Africa, Europe, North America, and Australia, the community is often described by critics as tightly organized, highly insular, and defined by intense devotion to a single spiritual leader, the Syedna, formally titled the Dāʿī al-Mutlaq (the “Absolute Missionary”). The allegation made by critics is not simply that the Bohras are devout or communal, but that the community’s structure and enforcement mechanisms resemble a high-control system, with coercive obedience, fear-based conformity, and severe penalties for dissent.

In sociological and psychological literature, “cult” (or more precisely “high-control group”) is associated with authoritarian leadership, coercive control, and excessive devotion. Classic frameworks by Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Singer, and Janja Lalich identify recurring patterns: a leader treated as uniquely authoritative or infallible; discouragement of doubt and dissent; regulation of members’ choices, relationships, and time; a bounded “us vs them” worldview; information and communication control; financial extraction; and punitive barriers to leaving. The purpose of this essay is to assess the Dawoodi Bohra community as critics describe it, using those criteria, while keeping the specific quotes and formulations that critics point to as concrete examples, such as “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”), “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”), “slave of Syedna,” and the instruction that khatna “it must be done.”

**Leadership Structure and Authority of the Syedna**

The Dawoodi Bohra community is organized under a centralized, hierarchical chain of command. At the apex is the Syedna (Dāʿī al-Mutlaq), who functions as both spiritual head and administrative chief. Bohra doctrine holds that after the 21st Imam entered seclusion in the 12th century, he deputed the first Dāʿī to lead the community with complete authority over religious and secular affairs. Authority is presented as continuing through an unbroken lineage of Dāʿīs culminating in the contemporary Syedna. Loyalty and obedience are framed not as optional respect but as the central religious duty.

Critics argue that over time this office became monarchy-like and totalizing, especially under the 51st Syedna, Taher Saifuddin (1915–1965). Reformist histories describe a deliberate transformation of governance into an absolute system that concentrated money, prestige, and decision-making at the top. They allege that Taher Saifuddin sought the stature of a monarch and redesigned rituals to make submission visible and mandatory. The most notorious allegations include that he was called “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”) and treated as a figure whose authority extended beyond religious guidance into ownership-like power over people’s lives.

Critics cite practices introduced or intensified to cement loyalty, including language in which members were required to refer to themselves as “slave of Syedna,” and ritual prostration (sajda) to the Syedna. This is controversial from an Islamic standpoint because prostration is ordinarily reserved for God, and critics argue that turning it toward a human leader crosses the line from respect into worship-like veneration. Another phrase frequently cited is “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”). Treating the Syedna as the “Living Quran” creates a doctrinal structure in which the leader’s spoken guidance is framed as superior to or overriding the written scripture. In Lifton’s terms, this resembles “sacred science,” where doctrine is presented as unquestionable truth and leadership becomes the final authority that cannot be corrected.

In contemporary Bohra life, the Syedna’s authority is widely described as pervasive. Farmaan (formal directives) are treated as final. The leader is framed as the divinely appointed representative of the hidden Imam, and his decisions are treated as binding law inside the sect. In many accounts, questioning the Syedna is treated as disloyalty rather than inquiry. Public reverence is ritualized at gatherings, and the leader’s presence functions as the focus of spiritual emotion and communal identity. In a high-control system, this matters because loyalty to the leader becomes the main indicator of piety, replacing personal conscience or independent interpretation as the center of religious life.

A vivid demonstration of loyalty enforcement occurred during the 2014 succession dispute after the death of the 52nd Syedna. Two claimants emerged: Mufaddal Saifuddin and Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Reports from dissidents and journalists described campaigns aimed at producing uniform public allegiance, including demands that congregants sign loyalty oaths, public denunciations of the rival camp, and boycotts of suspected sympathizers. Critics describe classmates, friends, and relatives cutting ties with individuals who were rumored to be “on the wrong side,” illustrating how quickly social sanctions can be mobilized when leadership demands conformity.

**Distinct Beliefs and Theological Mechanisms that Sacralize Obedience**

Dawoodi Bohras profess monotheism and reverence for the Prophet Muhammad while distinguishing themselves through Musta’li Isma’ili theology linked to the Fatimid Imams. Critics focus less on esoteric doctrine as such and more on how doctrine is used operationally to sacralize obedience to a living leader. One key example is the Bohra articulation of Seven Pillars, with Walayah presented as the first and paramount pillar. Walayah is described as devotion to God, the Prophet, the Imam, and crucially the Dāʿī. By elevating devotion to the Dāʿī to the core of faith, critics argue, the theology becomes a mechanism that converts religious devotion into obedience to leadership.

The Mithaq (Misaaq) oath is another central mechanism. Members typically take this oath in early adolescence and renew it later. During the Mithaq, the individual pledges to accept the Syedna’s guidance “wholeheartedly and without reservation.” In high-control studies, initiation oaths taken at young ages are psychologically powerful because they fuse identity with loyalty: dissent later feels like betrayal of a sacred covenant rather than legitimate moral or intellectual inquiry. The oath also gives leadership a moral weapon: a doubter is not simply someone with questions, but someone violating a sworn promise.

Boundary-marking practices reinforce separation. Dress codes identify members publicly and create constant visible signals of compliance: men in white attire with a cap, women in the rida. Critics argue that uniformity is not merely cultural but disciplinary because deviation is easily visible and can trigger social suspicion. A communal language (Lisān al-Dāʿwat, blending Gujarati and Arabic) reinforces internal identity and can limit outsiders’ ability to understand internal instruction. Restrictions on access to sermons and religious spaces without community authorization further reduce external visibility, which critics interpret as a structural feature of information control.

A particularly controversial and widely documented practice associated with Dawoodi Bohras is female genital mutilation (FGM), locally called khatna or “female circumcision.” The practice involves cutting the genitalia of young girls, is illegal in many countries, and is condemned as a human rights violation. Reports describe clergy framing it as religiously mandated and linked to purity. Critics cite as a concrete example a sermon attributed to the current Syedna instructing followers that “it must be done.” In cult analysis, the significance is that a direct command can override law, ethics, and bodily autonomy, showing the practical reach of leader authority.

**Behavioral Expectations, Conformity, and Social Contro**l

High-control groups regulate daily life through a mixture of rules, surveillance, peer pressure, and fear of sanctions. In Dawoodi Bohra life, critics describe an elaborate system of behavioral expectations that extends beyond worship into personal decisions. The Mithaq oath acts as a psychological contract: by pledging unconditional obedience, members are conditioned to interpret autonomy as disobedience. Reformist scholars and former members report that the Syedna’s administration dictates, in detail, how members should “think, act and feel,” including expectations around social behavior, public displays of loyalty, and compliance with clerical instructions.

A striking line attributed to Asghar Ali Engineer is often repeated: “You can’t literally breathe without their permission.” Even if understood as rhetorical emphasis, the quote captures a broader experience described by former members: the feeling that the Syedna’s authority is not limited to ritual or theology but extends into the texture of everyday life. Another allegation is that acts undertaken without raza (permission or blessing) are considered spiritually defective or unacceptable, with some accounts stating that even common life events must be routed through clerical approval structures. In high-control terms, this places the leader as gatekeeper of legitimacy, training members to experience independence as spiritual failure.

Conformity is reinforced by visible, administrative, and social mechanisms. Dress codes make obedience visible and deviation obvious. Critics describe rapid “classification” of members who deviate, with suspicion directed at those who adopt symbols associated with reformists. Identification systems (often described as e-Jamaat cards) regulate access to mosques and functions. When access is mediated by internal authorities, gatekeeping becomes a tool of control: belonging can be conditioned on obedience and compliance, rather than being a simple matter of shared faith.

Social life is densely internalized. Communal meals, frequent gatherings, and structured committees create networks in which absence is noticed and drift is difficult to hide. These networks can function as surveillance: members are observed by peers, and conformity becomes the default. Peer enforcement reduces the need for overt force; fear of being judged, reported, or socially downgraded can be sufficient. Critics describe “denunciation sessions” in which objectors were shamed until they repented or fell silent, reinforcing the idea that disagreement is not an acceptable stance but a moral defect.

Information and thought control are also frequently alleged. Critics describe discouragement of reading material critical of the Syedna, warnings against engaging with reformist writings, and reliance on closed sermons as the primary channel of religious instruction. When key messages are delivered in closed settings and members are warned against outside sources, the internal worldview becomes difficult to challenge. This is Lifton’s “milieu control”: controlling communication and social environment so that alternative interpretations rarely penetrate. The result is a system in which doubt becomes both psychologically and socially costly.

The “us vs them” mindset emerges through boundary maintenance. Critics point to discouragement around friendships and marriages outside the community, and a persistent message that mixing with outsiders is spiritually risky. Even within Islam, critics cite norms that encourage Bohras to remain separate from other Muslims in significant religious contexts. In cult typologies, boundary enforcement increases dependence by shrinking the member’s social world to the group itself, making exit socially catastrophic.

**Financial Obligations, Opacity, and Economic Leverage**

High-control groups often use money as both extraction and enforcement. In the Dawoodi Bohra system, members are expected to contribute through multiple categories of dues and donations to the Syedna’s administration (often referred to as the Kothar). These include religious dues (often described as mal-e-wajebat), annual assessments, and payments tied to milestones and services such as weddings, burials, and blessings. Additional recurring collections are framed as charitable contributions, and fundraising is woven into the moral language of loyalty and duty.

Former insiders describe assessments that are privately set by officials and experienced as obligatory rather than voluntary. Families may feel pressure to pay “suggested” amounts to remain in good standing. In high-control dynamics, this pressure matters because giving becomes a loyalty test: refusal signals disobedience. Critics also emphasize the absence of transparent, independently audited accounting. When members cannot see how funds are collected and spent, and when leadership controls decisions unilaterally, money becomes an instrument of authority rather than a communal resource.

Reformist accounts allege that under Taher Saifuddin, doctrine was advanced that members’ wealth and property “belonged to the Syedna,” with individuals holding assets as custodians. This framing is significant because it sanctifies extraction by turning it into a religious claim of ownership. Critics argue it creates a theology of dispossession: members are told they are merely caretakers, while the leader is the true owner. In cult frameworks, sacralized financial claims are common because they merge spiritual status with material control, making resistance feel like rebellion against God.

Critics further describe the sale of honorary titles and the conversion of communal trusts into leadership-controlled fiefdoms. They cite opulence, lavish ceremonies, and displays of wealth as visible signals that resources flow upward. The broader pattern emphasized is concentration of financial power at the top paired with limited oversight. In a high-control group, money is not only about enrichment; it is about authority. Controlling the financial system reinforces the leader’s supremacy and makes members dependent on the institution for status and access.

Economic leverage can be tied to access. Reports describe systems in which dues, card renewals, or compliance affect entry to community functions and eligibility for key rites, including burial. If a member cannot access religious life without financial compliance, money becomes coercive. Cult studies frequently identify this pattern: when a group controls the primary spiritual and social environment, it can turn financial obligations into enforceable conditions of existence within the member’s world. The threat is not only personal loss but family disgrace and spiritual exclusion.

**Treatment of Dissenters and Ex-Members**

The most direct measure of coercive control is how a group responds to dissent and exit. In the Dawoodi Bohra community, a central enforcement mechanism is excommunication, described as baraat or Jamaat kharij. The Syedna claims authority to expel members deemed disloyal or disobedient. Excommunication is described by critics as a package of penalties designed to isolate the individual and deter others.

Accounts describe consequences including:

• Exclusion from Bohra mosques and community centers, eliminating participation in communal worship and gatherings.

• Denial of burial in Bohra cemeteries, threatening spiritual and familial continuity.

• A mandated social boycott: members, including relatives, are expected to cut off relations, refuse greetings, and avoid business dealings.

• Pressure on family structures: spouses and relatives may be forced to choose between the dissenter and community standing, with marriages treated as void in community practice when a spouse is cast out.

Critics describe this as “civil death,” closely resembling Lifton’s “dispensing of existence,” where the group treats defectors as if they do not exist. The fear of this outcome suppresses dissent even among those who privately disagree. Former members describe ostracism, harassment, intimidation, and in some reports, violent incidents against reformists. Accounts describe dissidents’ businesses being boycotted, gatherings disrupted, and reputations attacked. Even without violence, the loss of family and community constitutes an extreme exit penalty.

The case of reformist leader Asghar Ali Engineer is frequently cited. When he was excommunicated for challenging the priesthood, accounts describe family members being pressured to choose community standing over contact with him. Critics argue that the purpose is not only punishment but demonstration: the community sees what happens to dissenters, and learns that silence is safer. This is a standard high-control dynamic: a few severe examples keep the many compliant.

The 2014 succession dispute illustrates modern application of these mechanisms. Reports describe preemptive demands for allegiance forms and rapid social boycott of those suspected of sympathy with the rival claimant. Accounts associated with Shireen Hamza describe overnight severing of lifelong friendships, smear narratives used to discredit dissenters, and institutional exclusion. The content of the dispute is less important than the method: dissent is treated as impurity, and social punishment is used to enforce uniformity.

Legal history in India has intersected with these practices. A 1962 Supreme Court of India decision protected the Syedna’s excommunication power under religious freedom claims. Later debates and evolving norms about social boycott and rights have pushed re-examination. The legal dimension shows that this power has been treated as institutional, not metaphorical. Even if used selectively, its existence acts as background pressure: members do not need to be excommunicated personally to be controlled; they only need to believe the threat is real.

**Mainstream Muslim Critiques and Commission Findings**

Beyond reformists, many mainstream Muslim scholars have criticized Bohra practices as unorthodox, particularly where leader veneration appears to cross into quasi-deification. Critics cite allegations of prostration to the Syedna, language of “God on Earth,” and the framing of the leader as “Living Quran” as evidence of shirk-like innovation. Historically, such allegations contributed to distancing and conflict with other Muslims, including disputes over sermons and rhetoric directed at figures revered by the broader Muslim community.

Inquiry commissions in India in the 1970s, including the Nathwani and Tiwatia inquiries (frequently referenced by reformist literature), collected complaints and testimonies regarding clerical abuses, coercive financial practices, and authoritarian governance. While parties dispute details, the relevance here is structural: allegations were not isolated online claims but were framed in formal settings as patterns of abuse. Critics highlight testimonies that described denial of burial rites, pressure-based fundraising, intimidation, and misuse of excommunication powers. For a high-control analysis, the presence of repeated complaints in multiple venues supports the claim that these were systematic concerns rather than rare anomalies.

**Perspectives from Former Members and Investigative Reporting**

Former members often characterize the Dawoodi Bohra system as a “cult” because of lived experience: childhood conditioning toward unconditional loyalty, routine reinforcement through sermons, and fear of excommunication. They describe self-censorship as a survival strategy: even if someone doubts privately, they remain outwardly compliant because the costs of dissent include family rupture, business harm, and social annihilation. In cult-recovery literature, this is a familiar profile: the member’s internal doubts are managed through fear, and social penalties convert belief into behavior even when belief is wavering.

Many former members describe the psychological aftermath of leaving as loneliness, identity crisis, and intense fear, including fear of damnation and fear of losing all social ties. These are common symptoms after exiting a totalistic environment. The point is not that every Bohra experiences the community identically, but that the structure creates conditions in which coercion can be sustained because dissent is punished and information is controlled. When exit is experienced as “death,” remaining compliant becomes the safer choice, even for those who disagree internally.

Investigative reporting has repeatedly highlighted FGM and excommunication because they are points where internal rules collide with law and universal rights norms. Coverage often notes secrecy, reluctance of insiders to speak publicly, and fear of repercussions. In the case of khatna, reporting emphasizes that the practice persists in diaspora contexts where laws prohibit it, suggesting that leadership instruction and community enforcement can override external authority. In the case of excommunication, reporting emphasizes the real-world consequences: loss of family, loss of communal rites, and the threat of social annihilation for anyone who challenges leadership.

**Academic and Sociological Analysis of High-Control Dynamics**

Scholars of religion and sociology often avoid the casual use of the word “cult” because it is rhetorically charged; instead they describe structures in terms of charismatic authority, total institutions, and bounded choice. In that vocabulary, critics argue that the Dawoodi Bohra system resembles a classic case of “bounded choice” (a term associated with Janja Lalich): members appear to choose participation, but their entire social reality is constructed so that alternative choices are experienced as unthinkable, dangerous, or spiritually fatal.

This dynamic is reinforced by what Lifton called the “demand for purity” and “confession.” Critics argue that moral status becomes inseparable from obedience: to be “pure” is to be aligned with the Syedna, while doubt is treated as contamination. Confession-like patterns emerge when members must seek clerical approval (raza), explain personal decisions, and demonstrate compliance publicly, especially during sensitive events such as succession disputes. The community’s intense emphasis on uniform dress and public loyalty functions as continual proof of purity, and those who deviate are treated as morally suspect.

Researchers also note the role of a “loaded language,” another Lifton marker. In Bohra contexts, critics point to specialized internal vocabulary, Syedna, farmaan, raza, Mithaq, baraat, Jamaat kharij, Lisān al-Dāʿwat, that carries moral force. Such terms compress complex realities into simple moral categories: obedience equals faith; dissent equals betrayal; departure equals impurity. A loaded language does not merely describe the world; it limits how members can think about the world by narrowing the available moral vocabulary.

The community’s structure can also resemble what sociologists call a “total institution” in partial form: not a prison that physically locks members inside, but a social environment that creates a near-total enclosure for identity, relationships, and moral legitimacy. Members may attend secular schools and hold ordinary jobs, yet the most important rites, social honors, marriage networks, business trust, and spiritual life are mediated through Jamaat structures. Critics argue that the result is functional captivity: to live normally is still to live under the shadow of clerical authority, because social survival is tied to community standing.

**Media and Public Documentation as External Corroboration**

Mainstream media investigations have periodically focused on points where Bohra internal norms collide with public law and ethics, especially FGM (khatna) and excommunication. Reporting repeatedly notes two themes: the difficulty outsiders have in observing the community because of restricted access to sermons and spaces, and the fear insiders describe when asked to speak publicly. Both themes are relevant to cult analysis. In high-control settings, secrecy is not merely privacy; it is a method of preventing external scrutiny and internal comparison.

FGM reporting is particularly important because it treats obedience as measurable. If a harmful practice persists across countries and legal regimes, that suggests that internal authority is powerful enough to override external deterrents. Critics cite the instruction that “it must be done” as precisely the kind of directive that transforms private conscience into compliance. The persistence of khatna is therefore not only a human-rights issue; it is a window into how command authority operates in everyday life and how communal enforcement can override personal judgment.

Media attention has also focused on leadership wealth, ceremonial grandeur, and the opacity of finances. While individual articles may vary in tone, critics emphasize that the very need for investigative reporting indicates a structural problem: ordinary members often cannot audit leadership claims internally, so outsiders become the only check. In high-control groups, external scrutiny is frequently treated as hostility, and internal members are trained to distrust critical reporting. This can produce a closed feedback loop where only leadership-approved information is considered legitimate.

**Detailed Mapping to Lifton’s Eight Criteria**

Robert Jay Lifton’s well-known criteria, developed in the context of thought reform, are often used as a structured checklist. Critics argue the Bohra system aligns with many of them in recognizable form:

1. Milieu Control: Critic accounts emphasize restricted access to sermons, discouragement of critical literature, and heavy reliance on internal messaging channels. By controlling who hears what, and in what setting, leadership can shape the social atmosphere in which beliefs are formed and reinforced.
2. Mystical Manipulation: The Syedna is framed as the divinely guided representative of the hidden Imam, so ordinary administrative directives are presented with spiritual weight. The requirement of raza for life decisions is cited as a practical expression of mystical manipulation: mundane choices are treated as spiritually contingent on leader approval.
3. Demand for Purity: Uniform dress, discipline expectations, and the moralization of obedience create a purity narrative. Dissent is treated not as difference but as impurity that threatens the community.
4. Confession: Although not always formalized as public confession, critics describe repeated demands to explain oneself to authorities, to seek permissions, and to demonstrate loyalty, including loyalty forms and oaths during disputes. The social environment can function as an ongoing confession mechanism.
5. Sacred Science: The leader’s position as “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”) and the sacralizing of Walayah are cited as examples of doctrine presented as unquestionable truth, with leadership as the ultimate interpretive authority.
6. Loaded Language: Terms like farmaan, raza, Mithaq, and baraat are not neutral; they encode obedience as virtue and dissent as deviance, compressing moral judgment into everyday speech.
7. Doctrine Over Person: Where members are expected to shun loved ones, accept voiding of marriages, or comply with harmful practices because leadership commands it, doctrine is placed above personal conscience and human bonds. The instruction that khatna “it must be done” is frequently cited as an example where doctrine overrides bodily autonomy and legal standards.
8. Dispensing of Existence: Baraat and social boycott function as the clearest example. The dissenter is treated as socially dead, and the community is instructed to behave as if the person does not exist.

Critics argue that even if one disputes the intensity of any single criterion, the accumulation across criteria is what matters. A group may have strong leadership without being a cult; it may have distinctive dress without being a cult; it may practice communal cohesion without being a cult. The cult-like pattern emerges when leadership exaltation, totalistic control, economic leverage, information restriction, and punitive exit costs operate together as a system.

**Additional Quotes and Formulations Used by Critics**

Because the debate often turns on specifics, critics repeatedly return to particular formulations and reported slogans to ground the analysis. The allegation that a Syedna was called “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”) is cited as shorthand for leader deification. The reported requirement that followers describe themselves as “slave of Syedna,” and that the Syedna’s authority extends over “soul, mind, body and properties,” is cited as shorthand for total submission. The label “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”) is cited as shorthand for sacred authority that overrides ordinary interpretation. Together, these specifics are used not as rhetorical flourishes but as examples of how high-control mechanisms are normalized within a religious frame. Critics argue that where such language becomes ordinary, it becomes difficult for members to even imagine a different religious life, which is precisely what cult scholars mean by bounded choice.

**Comparisons with Cult Frameworks**

Comparing the Dawoodi Bohra system to major frameworks yields substantial overlap.

1. Charismatic, unquestionable leadership. The Syedna is treated as divinely appointed and above challenge. Concrete examples and allegations of leader elevation include “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”), the requirement that members describe themselves as “slave of Syedna,” and the framing of the leader as “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”). These phrases function as evidence that the leader is treated not as a fallible scholar but as the living axis of truth and salvation.
2. Totalistic control and milieu control. The expectation of raza for major life decisions, combined with closed instruction, corresponds to control of social and informational context. Closed sermons, restricted access to religious spaces, and discouragement of critical materials align with environment and information control.
3. Sacred science and doctrine over person. Walayah as paramount and the Mithaq oath bind identity to obedience, turning dissent into spiritual betrayal. The instruction on khatna that “it must be done” is a direct example of doctrine overriding law, ethics, and bodily autonomy.
4. Us vs them boundaries. Distinct dress, internal language, restricted spaces, and relationship norms reinforce a bounded identity and reduce external influence. This increases dependence on the group and makes alternative social worlds feel inaccessible.
5. Exploitation and financial coercion. Multiple dues, opaque assessments, limited oversight, and access tied to compliance match patterns of economic leverage in cultic groups.
6. Fear of leaving and dispensing of existence. Excommunication, shunning, and family rupture create severe exit costs and produce “bounded choice”: leaving is possible in theory but socially catastrophic in practice.

Taken together, the overlap with Lifton, Singer, and Lalich’s criteria is strong. The combination of leader exaltation, behavioral regulation, financial opacity, information restriction, and severe punishment for dissent is consistent with high-control cult dynamics.

**Conclusion**

Assessing the Dawoodi Bohra community through established cult frameworks yields a consistent picture: the group exhibits multiple hallmark features of a high-control system. Leadership is centralized and sacralized to an extreme degree, with concrete examples and allegations of leader exaltation including “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”), “slave of Syedna,” “soul, mind, body and properties,” and “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”). Theology elevates loyalty to the Dāʿī through Walayah and binds members through the Mithaq oath taken from youth, framing dissent as betrayal rather than conscience.

Behaviorally, critics describe a system of permission-seeking (raza), uniformity enforcement, boundary maintenance, and peer surveillance that matches classic high-control patterns. Information is shaped through closed sermons and discouragement of dissenting material. Financially, critics describe multiple obligatory dues, opaque assessments, claims that property “belonged to the Syedna,” and economic gatekeeping that can affect access to communal life. Most decisively, the treatment of dissenters is described as punitive and socially annihilating: baraat (excommunication), boycotts, family rupture, and denial of communal rites.

Singer, Lalich, and the “13 of the 15” Claim

Margaret Singer’s descriptions of coercive persuasion and Janja Lalich’s later synthesis are often cited by ex-members because they translate “cult” into lived experience: who controls relationships, information, money, identity, and exit. Former Bohras have explicitly compared their upbringing to Lalich-style checklists. A commonly repeated statement in ex-member discussions is that the community meets “13 of the 15 characteristics” in such lists. The number is not offered as a scientific measurement. It is used as shorthand to express that most control markers feel familiar to those who left.

Several elements in those checklists map directly onto the allegations described above: the leader is treated as the center of devotion and as beyond accountability; doubt is discouraged and reframed as spiritual weakness or betrayal; members are expected to devote disproportionate time to sanctioned rituals, gatherings, and obedience demonstrations; the group is separative, reinforced by dress, closed spaces, and internal language; and identity becomes fused with the community so that leaving feels like losing one’s whole world.

Critics also highlight that a group can be high-control even without stereotypes that dominate popular culture. The Dawoodi Bohras largely grow through birth and endogamy rather than aggressive public recruitment, and members often live in ordinary neighborhoods rather than isolated compounds. But recruitment and geography are not required features in academic typologies. Retention can be achieved through childhood conditioning, oath mechanisms (Mithaq), constant reinforcement that obedience equals salvation, and severe penalties for dissent and exit.

Ex-members emphasize that the strongest evidence of coercive control is not a single rule but the combined effect of many constraints: the need for approvals, the fear of reputational damage, the threat of being denied communal rites, and the knowledge that family ties can be weaponized through mandated social boycott. In that environment, compliance can look like free choice from the outside while being experienced as necessity from the inside.

Some former members describe the system as self-sealing: when criticism arises, it is dismissed as hostile propaganda; when a member suffers, the suffering is framed as a test of loyalty; when doubt appears, it is framed as spiritual illness to be cured through deeper submission. This pattern matters because it reduces the role of evidence. If every counterexample is reinterpreted as proof that the leader is right, then ordinary mechanisms of self-correction are disabled.

Synthesis and Final Emphasis

The core argument advanced by critics can be stated plainly: a system becomes cult-like when it fuses religious meaning to leader obedience, makes leadership approval necessary for ordinary life, punishes dissent with social annihilation, and protects doctrine and finances from internal scrutiny. The quoted formulations, “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”), “slave of Syedna,” “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”), “soul, mind, body and properties,” “You can’t literally breathe without their permission,” and the instruction that khatna “it must be done,” are cited as concrete examples of leader elevation and command authority.

The Dawoodi Bohras are a sub-sect of Isma’ili Shia Islam with roughly one million followers worldwide. Historically centered in Gujarat (India) and now spread across South Asia, the Middle East, East Africa, Europe, North America, and Australia, the community is often described by critics as tightly organized, highly insular, and defined by intense devotion to a single spiritual leader, the Syedna, formally titled the Dāʿī al-Mutlaq (the “Absolute Missionary”). The allegation made by critics is not simply that the Bohras are devout or communal, but that the community’s structure and enforcement mechanisms resemble a high-control system, with coercive obedience, fear-based conformity, and severe penalties for dissent.

In sociological and psychological literature, “cult” (or more precisely “high-control group”) is associated with authoritarian leadership, coercive control, and excessive devotion. Classic frameworks by Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Singer, and Janja Lalich identify recurring patterns: a leader treated as uniquely authoritative or infallible; discouragement of doubt and dissent; regulation of members’ choices, relationships, and time; a bounded “us vs them” worldview; information and communication control; financial extraction; and punitive barriers to leaving. The purpose of this essay is to assess the Dawoodi Bohra community as critics describe it, using those criteria, while keeping the specific quotes and formulations that critics point to as concrete examples, such as “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”), “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”), “slave of Syedna,” and the instruction that khatna “it must be done.”

**Leadership Structure and Authority of the Syedna**

The Dawoodi Bohra community is organized under a centralized, hierarchical chain of command. At the apex is the Syedna (Dāʿī al-Mutlaq), who functions as both spiritual head and administrative chief. Bohra doctrine holds that after the 21st Imam entered seclusion in the 12th century, he deputed the first Dāʿī to lead the community with complete authority over religious and secular affairs. Authority is presented as continuing through an unbroken lineage of Dāʿīs culminating in the contemporary Syedna. Loyalty and obedience are framed not as optional respect but as the central religious duty.

Critics argue that over time this office became monarchy-like and totalizing, especially under the 51st Syedna, Taher Saifuddin (1915–1965). Reformist histories describe a deliberate transformation of governance into an absolute system that concentrated money, prestige, and decision-making at the top. They allege that Taher Saifuddin sought the stature of a monarch and redesigned rituals to make submission visible and mandatory. The most notorious allegations include that he was called “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”) and treated as a figure whose authority extended beyond religious guidance into ownership-like power over people’s lives.

Critics cite practices introduced or intensified to cement loyalty, including language in which members were required to refer to themselves as “slave of Syedna,” and ritual prostration (sajda) to the Syedna. This is controversial from an Islamic standpoint because prostration is ordinarily reserved for God, and critics argue that turning it toward a human leader crosses the line from respect into worship-like veneration. Another phrase frequently cited is “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”). Treating the Syedna as the “Living Quran” creates a doctrinal structure in which the leader’s spoken guidance is framed as superior to or overriding the written scripture. In Lifton’s terms, this resembles “sacred science,” where doctrine is presented as unquestionable truth and leadership becomes the final authority that cannot be corrected.

In contemporary Bohra life, the Syedna’s authority is widely described as pervasive. Farmaan (formal directives) are treated as final. The leader is framed as the divinely appointed representative of the hidden Imam, and his decisions are treated as binding law inside the sect. In many accounts, questioning the Syedna is treated as disloyalty rather than inquiry. Public reverence is ritualized at gatherings, and the leader’s presence functions as the focus of spiritual emotion and communal identity. In a high-control system, this matters because loyalty to the leader becomes the main indicator of piety, replacing personal conscience or independent interpretation as the center of religious life.

A vivid demonstration of loyalty enforcement occurred during the 2014 succession dispute after the death of the 52nd Syedna. Two claimants emerged: Mufaddal Saifuddin and Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Reports from dissidents and journalists described campaigns aimed at producing uniform public allegiance, including demands that congregants sign loyalty oaths, public denunciations of the rival camp, and boycotts of suspected sympathizers. Critics describe classmates, friends, and relatives cutting ties with individuals who were rumored to be “on the wrong side,” illustrating how quickly social sanctions can be mobilized when leadership demands conformity.

**Distinct Beliefs and Theological Mechanisms that Sacralize Obedience**

Dawoodi Bohras profess monotheism and reverence for the Prophet Muhammad while distinguishing themselves through Musta’li Isma’ili theology linked to the Fatimid Imams. Critics focus less on esoteric doctrine as such and more on how doctrine is used operationally to sacralize obedience to a living leader. One key example is the Bohra articulation of Seven Pillars, with Walayah presented as the first and paramount pillar. Walayah is described as devotion to God, the Prophet, the Imam, and crucially the Dāʿī. By elevating devotion to the Dāʿī to the core of faith, critics argue, the theology becomes a mechanism that converts religious devotion into obedience to leadership.

The Mithaq (Misaaq) oath is another central mechanism. Members typically take this oath in early adolescence and renew it later. During the Mithaq, the individual pledges to accept the Syedna’s guidance “wholeheartedly and without reservation.” In high-control studies, initiation oaths taken at young ages are psychologically powerful because they fuse identity with loyalty: dissent later feels like betrayal of a sacred covenant rather than legitimate moral or intellectual inquiry. The oath also gives leadership a moral weapon: a doubter is not simply someone with questions, but someone violating a sworn promise.

Boundary-marking practices reinforce separation. Dress codes identify members publicly and create constant visible signals of compliance: men in white attire with a cap, women in the rida. Critics argue that uniformity is not merely cultural but disciplinary because deviation is easily visible and can trigger social suspicion. A communal language (Lisān al-Dāʿwat, blending Gujarati and Arabic) reinforces internal identity and can limit outsiders’ ability to understand internal instruction. Restrictions on access to sermons and religious spaces without community authorization further reduce external visibility, which critics interpret as a structural feature of information control.

A particularly controversial and widely documented practice associated with Dawoodi Bohras is female genital mutilation (FGM), locally called khatna or “female circumcision.” The practice involves cutting the genitalia of young girls, is illegal in many countries, and is condemned as a human rights violation. Reports describe clergy framing it as religiously mandated and linked to purity. Critics cite as a concrete example a sermon attributed to the current Syedna instructing followers that “it must be done.” In cult analysis, the significance is that a direct command can override law, ethics, and bodily autonomy, showing the practical reach of leader authority.

**Behavioral Expectations, Conformity, and Social Contro**l

High-control groups regulate daily life through a mixture of rules, surveillance, peer pressure, and fear of sanctions. In Dawoodi Bohra life, critics describe an elaborate system of behavioral expectations that extends beyond worship into personal decisions. The Mithaq oath acts as a psychological contract: by pledging unconditional obedience, members are conditioned to interpret autonomy as disobedience. Reformist scholars and former members report that the Syedna’s administration dictates, in detail, how members should “think, act and feel,” including expectations around social behavior, public displays of loyalty, and compliance with clerical instructions.

A striking line attributed to Asghar Ali Engineer is often repeated: “You can’t literally breathe without their permission.” Even if understood as rhetorical emphasis, the quote captures a broader experience described by former members: the feeling that the Syedna’s authority is not limited to ritual or theology but extends into the texture of everyday life. Another allegation is that acts undertaken without raza (permission or blessing) are considered spiritually defective or unacceptable, with some accounts stating that even common life events must be routed through clerical approval structures. In high-control terms, this places the leader as gatekeeper of legitimacy, training members to experience independence as spiritual failure.

Conformity is reinforced by visible, administrative, and social mechanisms. Dress codes make obedience visible and deviation obvious. Critics describe rapid “classification” of members who deviate, with suspicion directed at those who adopt symbols associated with reformists. Identification systems (often described as e-Jamaat cards) regulate access to mosques and functions. When access is mediated by internal authorities, gatekeeping becomes a tool of control: belonging can be conditioned on obedience and compliance, rather than being a simple matter of shared faith.

Social life is densely internalized. Communal meals, frequent gatherings, and structured committees create networks in which absence is noticed and drift is difficult to hide. These networks can function as surveillance: members are observed by peers, and conformity becomes the default. Peer enforcement reduces the need for overt force; fear of being judged, reported, or socially downgraded can be sufficient. Critics describe “denunciation sessions” in which objectors were shamed until they repented or fell silent, reinforcing the idea that disagreement is not an acceptable stance but a moral defect.

Information and thought control are also frequently alleged. Critics describe discouragement of reading material critical of the Syedna, warnings against engaging with reformist writings, and reliance on closed sermons as the primary channel of religious instruction. When key messages are delivered in closed settings and members are warned against outside sources, the internal worldview becomes difficult to challenge. This is Lifton’s “milieu control”: controlling communication and social environment so that alternative interpretations rarely penetrate. The result is a system in which doubt becomes both psychologically and socially costly.

The “us vs them” mindset emerges through boundary maintenance. Critics point to discouragement around friendships and marriages outside the community, and a persistent message that mixing with outsiders is spiritually risky. Even within Islam, critics cite norms that encourage Bohras to remain separate from other Muslims in significant religious contexts. In cult typologies, boundary enforcement increases dependence by shrinking the member’s social world to the group itself, making exit socially catastrophic.

**Financial Obligations, Opacity, and Economic Leverage**

High-control groups often use money as both extraction and enforcement. In the Dawoodi Bohra system, members are expected to contribute through multiple categories of dues and donations to the Syedna’s administration (often referred to as the Kothar). These include religious dues (often described as mal-e-wajebat), annual assessments, and payments tied to milestones and services such as weddings, burials, and blessings. Additional recurring collections are framed as charitable contributions, and fundraising is woven into the moral language of loyalty and duty.

Former insiders describe assessments that are privately set by officials and experienced as obligatory rather than voluntary. Families may feel pressure to pay “suggested” amounts to remain in good standing. In high-control dynamics, this pressure matters because giving becomes a loyalty test: refusal signals disobedience. Critics also emphasize the absence of transparent, independently audited accounting. When members cannot see how funds are collected and spent, and when leadership controls decisions unilaterally, money becomes an instrument of authority rather than a communal resource.

Reformist accounts allege that under Taher Saifuddin, doctrine was advanced that members’ wealth and property “belonged to the Syedna,” with individuals holding assets as custodians. This framing is significant because it sanctifies extraction by turning it into a religious claim of ownership. Critics argue it creates a theology of dispossession: members are told they are merely caretakers, while the leader is the true owner. In cult frameworks, sacralized financial claims are common because they merge spiritual status with material control, making resistance feel like rebellion against God.

Critics further describe the sale of honorary titles and the conversion of communal trusts into leadership-controlled fiefdoms. They cite opulence, lavish ceremonies, and displays of wealth as visible signals that resources flow upward. The broader pattern emphasized is concentration of financial power at the top paired with limited oversight. In a high-control group, money is not only about enrichment; it is about authority. Controlling the financial system reinforces the leader’s supremacy and makes members dependent on the institution for status and access.

Economic leverage can be tied to access. Reports describe systems in which dues, card renewals, or compliance affect entry to community functions and eligibility for key rites, including burial. If a member cannot access religious life without financial compliance, money becomes coercive. Cult studies frequently identify this pattern: when a group controls the primary spiritual and social environment, it can turn financial obligations into enforceable conditions of existence within the member’s world. The threat is not only personal loss but family disgrace and spiritual exclusion.

**Treatment of Dissenters and Ex-Members**

The most direct measure of coercive control is how a group responds to dissent and exit. In the Dawoodi Bohra community, a central enforcement mechanism is excommunication, described as baraat or Jamaat kharij. The Syedna claims authority to expel members deemed disloyal or disobedient. Excommunication is described by critics as a package of penalties designed to isolate the individual and deter others.

Accounts describe consequences including:

• Exclusion from Bohra mosques and community centers, eliminating participation in communal worship and gatherings.

• Denial of burial in Bohra cemeteries, threatening spiritual and familial continuity.

• A mandated social boycott: members, including relatives, are expected to cut off relations, refuse greetings, and avoid business dealings.

• Pressure on family structures: spouses and relatives may be forced to choose between the dissenter and community standing, with marriages treated as void in community practice when a spouse is cast out.

Critics describe this as “civil death,” closely resembling Lifton’s “dispensing of existence,” where the group treats defectors as if they do not exist. The fear of this outcome suppresses dissent even among those who privately disagree. Former members describe ostracism, harassment, intimidation, and in some reports, violent incidents against reformists. Accounts describe dissidents’ businesses being boycotted, gatherings disrupted, and reputations attacked. Even without violence, the loss of family and community constitutes an extreme exit penalty.

The case of reformist leader Asghar Ali Engineer is frequently cited. When he was excommunicated for challenging the priesthood, accounts describe family members being pressured to choose community standing over contact with him. Critics argue that the purpose is not only punishment but demonstration: the community sees what happens to dissenters, and learns that silence is safer. This is a standard high-control dynamic: a few severe examples keep the many compliant.

The 2014 succession dispute illustrates modern application of these mechanisms. Reports describe preemptive demands for allegiance forms and rapid social boycott of those suspected of sympathy with the rival claimant. Accounts associated with Shireen Hamza describe overnight severing of lifelong friendships, smear narratives used to discredit dissenters, and institutional exclusion. The content of the dispute is less important than the method: dissent is treated as impurity, and social punishment is used to enforce uniformity.

Legal history in India has intersected with these practices. A 1962 Supreme Court of India decision protected the Syedna’s excommunication power under religious freedom claims. Later debates and evolving norms about social boycott and rights have pushed re-examination. The legal dimension shows that this power has been treated as institutional, not metaphorical. Even if used selectively, its existence acts as background pressure: members do not need to be excommunicated personally to be controlled; they only need to believe the threat is real.

**Mainstream Muslim Critiques and Commission Findings**

Beyond reformists, many mainstream Muslim scholars have criticized Bohra practices as unorthodox, particularly where leader veneration appears to cross into quasi-deification. Critics cite allegations of prostration to the Syedna, language of “God on Earth,” and the framing of the leader as “Living Quran” as evidence of shirk-like innovation. Historically, such allegations contributed to distancing and conflict with other Muslims, including disputes over sermons and rhetoric directed at figures revered by the broader Muslim community.

Inquiry commissions in India in the 1970s, including the Nathwani and Tiwatia inquiries (frequently referenced by reformist literature), collected complaints and testimonies regarding clerical abuses, coercive financial practices, and authoritarian governance. While parties dispute details, the relevance here is structural: allegations were not isolated online claims but were framed in formal settings as patterns of abuse. Critics highlight testimonies that described denial of burial rites, pressure-based fundraising, intimidation, and misuse of excommunication powers. For a high-control analysis, the presence of repeated complaints in multiple venues supports the claim that these were systematic concerns rather than rare anomalies.

**Perspectives from Former Members and Investigative Reporting**

Former members often characterize the Dawoodi Bohra system as a “cult” because of lived experience: childhood conditioning toward unconditional loyalty, routine reinforcement through sermons, and fear of excommunication. They describe self-censorship as a survival strategy: even if someone doubts privately, they remain outwardly compliant because the costs of dissent include family rupture, business harm, and social annihilation. In cult-recovery literature, this is a familiar profile: the member’s internal doubts are managed through fear, and social penalties convert belief into behavior even when belief is wavering.

Many former members describe the psychological aftermath of leaving as loneliness, identity crisis, and intense fear, including fear of damnation and fear of losing all social ties. These are common symptoms after exiting a totalistic environment. The point is not that every Bohra experiences the community identically, but that the structure creates conditions in which coercion can be sustained because dissent is punished and information is controlled. When exit is experienced as “death,” remaining compliant becomes the safer choice, even for those who disagree internally.

Investigative reporting has repeatedly highlighted FGM and excommunication because they are points where internal rules collide with law and universal rights norms. Coverage often notes secrecy, reluctance of insiders to speak publicly, and fear of repercussions. In the case of khatna, reporting emphasizes that the practice persists in diaspora contexts where laws prohibit it, suggesting that leadership instruction and community enforcement can override external authority. In the case of excommunication, reporting emphasizes the real-world consequences: loss of family, loss of communal rites, and the threat of social annihilation for anyone who challenges leadership.

**Academic and Sociological Analysis of High-Control Dynamics**

Scholars of religion and sociology often avoid the casual use of the word “cult” because it is rhetorically charged; instead they describe structures in terms of charismatic authority, total institutions, and bounded choice. In that vocabulary, critics argue that the Dawoodi Bohra system resembles a classic case of “bounded choice” (a term associated with Janja Lalich): members appear to choose participation, but their entire social reality is constructed so that alternative choices are experienced as unthinkable, dangerous, or spiritually fatal.

This dynamic is reinforced by what Lifton called the “demand for purity” and “confession.” Critics argue that moral status becomes inseparable from obedience: to be “pure” is to be aligned with the Syedna, while doubt is treated as contamination. Confession-like patterns emerge when members must seek clerical approval (raza), explain personal decisions, and demonstrate compliance publicly, especially during sensitive events such as succession disputes. The community’s intense emphasis on uniform dress and public loyalty functions as continual proof of purity, and those who deviate are treated as morally suspect.

Researchers also note the role of a “loaded language,” another Lifton marker. In Bohra contexts, critics point to specialized internal vocabulary, Syedna, farmaan, raza, Mithaq, baraat, Jamaat kharij, Lisān al-Dāʿwat, that carries moral force. Such terms compress complex realities into simple moral categories: obedience equals faith; dissent equals betrayal; departure equals impurity. A loaded language does not merely describe the world; it limits how members can think about the world by narrowing the available moral vocabulary.

The community’s structure can also resemble what sociologists call a “total institution” in partial form: not a prison that physically locks members inside, but a social environment that creates a near-total enclosure for identity, relationships, and moral legitimacy. Members may attend secular schools and hold ordinary jobs, yet the most important rites, social honors, marriage networks, business trust, and spiritual life are mediated through Jamaat structures. Critics argue that the result is functional captivity: to live normally is still to live under the shadow of clerical authority, because social survival is tied to community standing.

**Media and Public Documentation as External Corroboration**

Mainstream media investigations have periodically focused on points where Bohra internal norms collide with public law and ethics, especially FGM (khatna) and excommunication. Reporting repeatedly notes two themes: the difficulty outsiders have in observing the community because of restricted access to sermons and spaces, and the fear insiders describe when asked to speak publicly. Both themes are relevant to cult analysis. In high-control settings, secrecy is not merely privacy; it is a method of preventing external scrutiny and internal comparison.

FGM reporting is particularly important because it treats obedience as measurable. If a harmful practice persists across countries and legal regimes, that suggests that internal authority is powerful enough to override external deterrents. Critics cite the instruction that “it must be done” as precisely the kind of directive that transforms private conscience into compliance. The persistence of khatna is therefore not only a human-rights issue; it is a window into how command authority operates in everyday life and how communal enforcement can override personal judgment.

Media attention has also focused on leadership wealth, ceremonial grandeur, and the opacity of finances. While individual articles may vary in tone, critics emphasize that the very need for investigative reporting indicates a structural problem: ordinary members often cannot audit leadership claims internally, so outsiders become the only check. In high-control groups, external scrutiny is frequently treated as hostility, and internal members are trained to distrust critical reporting. This can produce a closed feedback loop where only leadership-approved information is considered legitimate.

**Detailed Mapping to Lifton’s Eight Criteria**

Robert Jay Lifton’s well-known criteria, developed in the context of thought reform, are often used as a structured checklist. Critics argue the Bohra system aligns with many of them in recognizable form:

1. Milieu Control: Critic accounts emphasize restricted access to sermons, discouragement of critical literature, and heavy reliance on internal messaging channels. By controlling who hears what, and in what setting, leadership can shape the social atmosphere in which beliefs are formed and reinforced.
2. Mystical Manipulation: The Syedna is framed as the divinely guided representative of the hidden Imam, so ordinary administrative directives are presented with spiritual weight. The requirement of raza for life decisions is cited as a practical expression of mystical manipulation: mundane choices are treated as spiritually contingent on leader approval.
3. Demand for Purity: Uniform dress, discipline expectations, and the moralization of obedience create a purity narrative. Dissent is treated not as difference but as impurity that threatens the community.
4. Confession: Although not always formalized as public confession, critics describe repeated demands to explain oneself to authorities, to seek permissions, and to demonstrate loyalty, including loyalty forms and oaths during disputes. The social environment can function as an ongoing confession mechanism.
5. Sacred Science: The leader’s position as “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”) and the sacralizing of Walayah are cited as examples of doctrine presented as unquestionable truth, with leadership as the ultimate interpretive authority.
6. Loaded Language: Terms like farmaan, raza, Mithaq, and baraat are not neutral; they encode obedience as virtue and dissent as deviance, compressing moral judgment into everyday speech.
7. Doctrine Over Person: Where members are expected to shun loved ones, accept voiding of marriages, or comply with harmful practices because leadership commands it, doctrine is placed above personal conscience and human bonds. The instruction that khatna “it must be done” is frequently cited as an example where doctrine overrides bodily autonomy and legal standards.
8. Dispensing of Existence: Baraat and social boycott function as the clearest example. The dissenter is treated as socially dead, and the community is instructed to behave as if the person does not exist.

Critics argue that even if one disputes the intensity of any single criterion, the accumulation across criteria is what matters. A group may have strong leadership without being a cult; it may have distinctive dress without being a cult; it may practice communal cohesion without being a cult. The cult-like pattern emerges when leadership exaltation, totalistic control, economic leverage, information restriction, and punitive exit costs operate together as a system.

**Additional Quotes and Formulations Used by Critics**

Because the debate often turns on specifics, critics repeatedly return to particular formulations and reported slogans to ground the analysis. The allegation that a Syedna was called “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”) is cited as shorthand for leader deification. The reported requirement that followers describe themselves as “slave of Syedna,” and that the Syedna’s authority extends over “soul, mind, body and properties,” is cited as shorthand for total submission. The label “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”) is cited as shorthand for sacred authority that overrides ordinary interpretation. Together, these specifics are used not as rhetorical flourishes but as examples of how high-control mechanisms are normalized within a religious frame. Critics argue that where such language becomes ordinary, it becomes difficult for members to even imagine a different religious life, which is precisely what cult scholars mean by bounded choice.

**Comparisons with Cult Frameworks**

Comparing the Dawoodi Bohra system to major frameworks yields substantial overlap.

1. Charismatic, unquestionable leadership. The Syedna is treated as divinely appointed and above challenge. Concrete examples and allegations of leader elevation include “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”), the requirement that members describe themselves as “slave of Syedna,” and the framing of the leader as “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”). These phrases function as evidence that the leader is treated not as a fallible scholar but as the living axis of truth and salvation.
2. Totalistic control and milieu control. The expectation of raza for major life decisions, combined with closed instruction, corresponds to control of social and informational context. Closed sermons, restricted access to religious spaces, and discouragement of critical materials align with environment and information control.
3. Sacred science and doctrine over person. Walayah as paramount and the Mithaq oath bind identity to obedience, turning dissent into spiritual betrayal. The instruction on khatna that “it must be done” is a direct example of doctrine overriding law, ethics, and bodily autonomy.
4. Us vs them boundaries. Distinct dress, internal language, restricted spaces, and relationship norms reinforce a bounded identity and reduce external influence. This increases dependence on the group and makes alternative social worlds feel inaccessible.
5. Exploitation and financial coercion. Multiple dues, opaque assessments, limited oversight, and access tied to compliance match patterns of economic leverage in cultic groups.
6. Fear of leaving and dispensing of existence. Excommunication, shunning, and family rupture create severe exit costs and produce “bounded choice”: leaving is possible in theory but socially catastrophic in practice.

Taken together, the overlap with Lifton, Singer, and Lalich’s criteria is strong. The combination of leader exaltation, behavioral regulation, financial opacity, information restriction, and severe punishment for dissent is consistent with high-control cult dynamics.

**Conclusion**

Assessing the Dawoodi Bohra community through established cult frameworks yields a consistent picture: the group exhibits multiple hallmark features of a high-control system. Leadership is centralized and sacralized to an extreme degree, with concrete examples and allegations of leader exaltation including “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”), “slave of Syedna,” “soul, mind, body and properties,” and “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”). Theology elevates loyalty to the Dāʿī through Walayah and binds members through the Mithaq oath taken from youth, framing dissent as betrayal rather than conscience.

Behaviorally, critics describe a system of permission-seeking (raza), uniformity enforcement, boundary maintenance, and peer surveillance that matches classic high-control patterns. Information is shaped through closed sermons and discouragement of dissenting material. Financially, critics describe multiple obligatory dues, opaque assessments, claims that property “belonged to the Syedna,” and economic gatekeeping that can affect access to communal life. Most decisively, the treatment of dissenters is described as punitive and socially annihilating: baraat (excommunication), boycotts, family rupture, and denial of communal rites.

Singer, Lalich, and the “13 of the 15” Claim

Margaret Singer’s descriptions of coercive persuasion and Janja Lalich’s later synthesis are often cited by ex-members because they translate “cult” into lived experience: who controls relationships, information, money, identity, and exit. Former Bohras have explicitly compared their upbringing to Lalich-style checklists. A commonly repeated statement in ex-member discussions is that the community meets “13 of the 15 characteristics” in such lists. The number is not offered as a scientific measurement. It is used as shorthand to express that most control markers feel familiar to those who left.

Several elements in those checklists map directly onto the allegations described above: the leader is treated as the center of devotion and as beyond accountability; doubt is discouraged and reframed as spiritual weakness or betrayal; members are expected to devote disproportionate time to sanctioned rituals, gatherings, and obedience demonstrations; the group is separative, reinforced by dress, closed spaces, and internal language; and identity becomes fused with the community so that leaving feels like losing one’s whole world.

Critics also highlight that a group can be high-control even without stereotypes that dominate popular culture. The Dawoodi Bohras largely grow through birth and endogamy rather than aggressive public recruitment, and members often live in ordinary neighborhoods rather than isolated compounds. But recruitment and geography are not required features in academic typologies. Retention can be achieved through childhood conditioning, oath mechanisms (Mithaq), constant reinforcement that obedience equals salvation, and severe penalties for dissent and exit.

Ex-members emphasize that the strongest evidence of coercive control is not a single rule but the combined effect of many constraints: the need for approvals, the fear of reputational damage, the threat of being denied communal rites, and the knowledge that family ties can be weaponized through mandated social boycott. In that environment, compliance can look like free choice from the outside while being experienced as necessity from the inside.

Some former members describe the system as self-sealing: when criticism arises, it is dismissed as hostile propaganda; when a member suffers, the suffering is framed as a test of loyalty; when doubt appears, it is framed as spiritual illness to be cured through deeper submission. This pattern matters because it reduces the role of evidence. If every counterexample is reinterpreted as proof that the leader is right, then ordinary mechanisms of self-correction are disabled.

Synthesis and Final Emphasis

The core argument advanced by critics can be stated plainly: a system becomes cult-like when it fuses religious meaning to leader obedience, makes leadership approval necessary for ordinary life, punishes dissent with social annihilation, and protects doctrine and finances from internal scrutiny. The quoted formulations, “Elahul-Ard” (“God on Earth”), “slave of Syedna,” “Qur’an-e Natiq” (“Living Quran”), “soul, mind, body and properties,” “You can’t literally breathe without their permission,” and the instruction that khatna “it must be done,” are cited as concrete examples of leader elevation and command authority.",assessing cult characteristics the dawoodi bohra community introduction

leadership demands conformity distinct beliefs and theological mechanisms that sacralize obedience dawoodi bohras profess monotheism and reverence for the prophet muhammad while distinguishing themselves through musta li isma ili theology linked to the fatimid imams critics focus less on esoteric doctrine as such and more on how doctrine is used operationally to sacralize obedience to a living leader one key example is the bohra articulation of seven pillars with walayah presented as the first and paramount pillar walayah is described as devotion to god the prophet the imam and crucially the d by elevating devotion to the d to the core of faith critics argue the theology becomes a mechanism that converts religious devotion into obedience to leadership the mithaq misaaq oath is another central mechanism members typically take this oath in early adolescence and renew it later during the mithaq the individual pledges to accept the syedna s guidance wholeheartedly and without reservation in high control studies initiation oaths taken at young ages are psychologically powerful because they fuse identity with loyalty dissent later feels like betrayal of a sacred covenant rather than legitimate moral or intellectual inquiry the oath also gives leadership a moral weapon a doubter is not simply someone with questions but someone violating a sworn promise boundary marking practices reinforce separation dress codes identify members publicly and create constant visible signals of compliance men in white attire with a cap women in the rida critics argue that uniformity is not merely cultural but disciplinary because deviation is easily visible and can trigger social suspicion a communal language lis n al d wat blending gujarati and arabic reinforces internal identity and can limit outsiders ability to understand internal instruction restrictions on access to sermons and religious spaces without community authorization further reduce external visibility which critics interpret as a structural feature of information control a particularly controversial and widely documented practice associated with dawoodi bohras is female genital mutilation fgm locally called khatna or female circumcision the practice involves cutting the genitalia of young girls is illegal in many countries and is condemned as a human rights violation reports describe clergy framing it as religiously mandated and linked to purity critics cite as a concrete example a sermon attributed to the current syedna instructing followers that it must be done in cult analysis the significance is that a direct command can override law ethics and bodily autonomy showing the practical reach of leader authority behavioral expectations conformity and social contro l high control groups regulate daily life through a mixture of rules surveillance peer pressure and fear of sanctions in dawoodi bohra life critics describe an elaborate system of behavioral expectations that extends beyond worship into personal decisions the mithaq oath acts as a psychological contract by pledging unconditional obedience members are conditioned to interpret autonomy as disobedience reformist scholars and former members report that the syedna s administration dictates in detail how members should think act and feel including expectations around social behavior public displays of loyalty and compliance with clerical instructions a striking line attributed to asghar ali engineer is often repeated you can t literally breathe without their permission even if understood as rhetorical emphasis the quote captures a broader experience described by former members the feeling that the syedna s authority is not limited to ritual or theology but extends into the texture of everyday life another allegation is that acts undertaken without raza permission or blessing are considered spiritually defective or unacceptable with some accounts stating that even common life events must be routed through clerical approval structures in high control terms this places the leader as gatekeeper of legitimacy training members to experience independence as spiritual failure conformity is reinforced by visible administrative and social mechanisms dress codes make obedience visible and deviation obvious critics describe rapid classification of members who deviate with suspicion directed at those who adopt symbols associated with reformists identification systems often described as e jamaat cards regulate access to mosques and functions when access is mediated by internal authorities gatekeeping becomes a tool of control belonging can be conditioned on obedience and compliance rather than being a simple matter of shared faith social life is densely internalized communal meals frequent gatherings and structured committees create networks in which absence is noticed and drift is difficult to hide these networks can function as surveillance members are observed by peers and conformity becomes the default peer enforcement reduces the need for overt force fear of being judged reported or socially downgraded can be sufficient critics describe denunciation sessions in which objectors were shamed until they repented or fell silent reinforcing the idea that disagreement is not an acceptable stance but a moral defect information and thought control are also frequently alleged critics describe discouragement of reading material critical of the syedna warnings against engaging with reformist writings and reliance on closed sermons as the primary channel of religious instruction when key messages are delivered in closed settings and members are warned against outside sources the internal worldview becomes difficult to challenge this is lifton s milieu control controlling communication and social environment so that alternative interpretations rarely penetrate the result is a system in which doubt becomes both psychologically and socially costly the us vs them mindset emerges through boundary maintenance critics point to discouragement around friendships and marriages outside the community and a persistent message that mixing with outsiders is spiritually risky even within islam critics cite norms that encourage bohras to remain separate from other muslims in significant religious contexts in cult typologies boundary enforcement increases dependence by shrinking the member s social world to the group itself making exit socially catastrophic financial obligations opacity and economic leverage high control groups often use money as both extraction and enforcement in the dawoodi bohra system members are expected to contribute through multiple categories of dues and donations to the syedna s administration often referred to as the kothar these include religious dues often described as mal e wajebat annual assessments and payments tied to milestones and services such as weddings burials and blessings additional recurring collections are framed as charitable contributions and fundraising is woven into the moral language of loyalty and duty former insiders describe assessments that are privately set by officials and experienced as obligatory rather than voluntary families may feel pressure to pay suggested amounts to remain in good standing in high control dynamics this pressure matters because giving becomes a loyalty test refusal signals disobedience critics also emphasize the absence of transparent independently audited accounting when members cannot see how funds are collected and spent and when leadership controls decisions unilaterally money becomes an instrument of authority rather than a communal resource reformist accounts allege that under taher saifuddin doctrine was advanced that members wealth and property belonged to the syedna with individuals holding assets as custodians this framing is significant because it sanctifies extraction by turning it into a religious claim of ownership critics argue it creates a theology of dispossession members are told they are merely caretakers while the leader is the true owner in cult frameworks sacralized financial claims are common because they merge spiritual status with material control making resistance feel like rebellion against god critics further describe the sale of honorary titles and the conversion of communal trusts into leadership controlled fiefdoms they cite opulence lavish ceremonies and displays of wealth as visible signals that resources flow upward the broader pattern emphasized is concentration of financial power at the top paired with limited oversight in a high control group money is not only about enrichment it is about authority controlling the financial system reinforces the leader s supremacy and makes members dependent on the institution for status and access economic leverage can be tied to access reports describe systems in which dues card renewals or compliance affect entry to community functions and eligibility for key rites including burial if a member cannot access religious life without financial compliance money becomes coercive cult studies frequently identify this pattern when a group controls the primary spiritual and social environment it can turn financial obligations into enforceable conditions of existence within the member s world the threat is not only personal loss but family disgrace and spiritual exclusion treatment of dissenters and ex members the most direct measure of coercive control is how a group responds to dissent and exit in the dawoodi bohra community a central enforcement mechanism is excommunication described as baraat or jamaat kharij the syedna claims authority to expel members deemed disloyal or disobedient excommunication is described by critics as a package of penalties designed to isolate the individual and deter others accounts describe consequences including exclusion from bohra mosques and community centers eliminating participation in communal worship and gatherings denial of burial in bohra cemeteries threatening spiritual and familial continuity a mandated social boycott members including relatives are expected to cut off relations refuse greetings and avoid business dealings pressure on family structures spouses and relatives may be forced to choose between the dissenter and community standing with marriages treated as void in community practice when a spouse is cast out critics describe this as civil death closely resembling lifton s dispensing of existence where the group treats defectors as if they do not exist the fear of this outcome suppresses dissent even among those who privately disagree former members describe ostracism harassment intimidation and in some reports violent incidents against reformists accounts describe dissidents businesses being boycotted gatherings disrupted and reputations attacked even without violence the loss of family and community constitutes an extreme exit penalty the case of reformist leader asghar ali engineer is frequently cited when he was excommunicated for challenging the priesthood accounts describe family members being pressured to choose community standing over contact with him critics argue that the purpose is not only punishment but demonstration the community sees what happens to dissenters and learns that silence is safer this is a standard high control dynamic a few severe examples keep the many compliant the succession dispute illustrates modern application of these mechanisms reports describe preemptive demands for allegiance forms and rapid social boycott of those suspected of sympathy with the rival claimant accounts associated with shireen hamza describe overnight severing of lifelong friendships smear narratives used to discredit dissenters and institutional exclusion the content of the dispute is less important than the method dissent is treated as impurity and social punishment is used to enforce uniformity legal history in india has intersected with these practices a supreme court of india decision protected the syedna s excommunication power under religious freedom claims later debates and evolving norms about social boycott and rights have pushed re examination the legal dimension shows that this power has been treated as institutional not metaphorical even if used selectively its existence acts as background pressure members do not need to be excommunicated personally to be controlled they only need to believe the threat is real mainstream muslim critiques and commission findings beyond reformists many mainstream muslim scholars have criticized bohra practices as unorthodox particularly where leader veneration appears to cross into quasi deification critics cite allegations of prostration to the syedna language of god on earth and the framing of the leader as living quran as evidence of shirk like innovation historically such allegations contributed to distancing and conflict with other muslims including disputes over sermons and rhetoric directed at figures revered by the broader muslim community inquiry commissions in india in the s including the nathwani and tiwatia inquiries frequently referenced by reformist literature collected complaints and testimonies regarding clerical abuses coercive financial practices and authoritarian governance while parties dispute details the relevance here is structural allegations were not isolated online claims but were framed in formal settings as patterns of abuse critics highlight testimonies that described denial of burial rites pressure based fundraising intimidation and misuse of excommunication powers for a high control analysis the presence of repeated complaints in multiple venues supports the claim that these were systematic concerns rather than rare anomalies perspectives from former members and investigative reporting former members often characterize the dawoodi bohra system as a cult because of lived experience childhood conditioning toward unconditional loyalty routine reinforcement through sermons and fear of excommunication they describe self censorship as a survival strategy even if someone doubts privately they remain outwardly compliant because the costs of dissent include family rupture business harm and social annihilation in cult recovery literature this is a familiar profile the member s internal doubts are managed through fear and social penalties convert belief into behavior even when belief is wavering many former members describe the psychological aftermath of leaving as loneliness identity crisis and intense fear including fear of damnation and fear of losing all social ties these are common symptoms after exiting a totalistic environment the point is not that every bohra experiences the community identically but that the structure creates conditions in which coercion can be sustained because dissent is punished and information is controlled when exit is experienced as death remaining compliant becomes the safer choice even for those who disagree internally investigative reporting has repeatedly highlighted fgm and excommunication because they are points where internal rules collide with law and universal rights norms coverage often notes secrecy reluctance of insiders to speak publicly and fear of repercussions in the case of khatna reporting emphasizes that the practice persists in diaspora contexts where laws prohibit it suggesting that leadership instruction and community enforcement can override external authority in the case of excommunication reporting emphasizes the real world consequences loss of family loss of communal rites and the threat of social annihilation for anyone who challenges leadership academic and sociological analysis of high control dynamics scholars of religion and sociology often avoid the casual use of the word cult because it is rhetorically charged instead they describe structures in terms of charismatic authority total institutions and bounded choice in that vocabulary critics argue that the dawoodi bohra system resembles a classic case of bounded choice a term associated with janja lalich members appear to choose participation but their entire social reality is constructed so that alternative choices are experienced as unthinkable dangerous or spiritually fatal this dynamic is reinforced by what lifton called the demand for purity and confession critics argue that moral status becomes inseparable from obedience to be pure is to be aligned with the syedna while doubt is treated as contamination confession like patterns emerge when members must seek clerical approval raza explain personal decisions and demonstrate compliance publicly especially during sensitive events such as succession disputes the community s intense emphasis on uniform dress and public loyalty functions as continual proof of purity and those who deviate are treated as morally suspect researchers also note the role of a loaded language another lifton marker in bohra contexts critics point to specialized internal vocabulary syedna farmaan raza mithaq baraat jamaat kharij lis n al d wat that carries moral force such terms compress complex realities into simple moral categories obedience equals faith dissent equals betrayal departure equals impurity a loaded language does not merely describe the world it limits how members can think about the world by narrowing the available moral vocabulary the community s structure can also resemble what sociologists call a total institution in partial form not a prison that physically locks members inside but a social environment that creates a near total enclosure for identity relationships and moral legitimacy members may attend secular schools and hold ordinary jobs yet the most important rites social honors marriage networks business trust and spiritual life are mediated through jamaat structures critics argue that the result is functional captivity to live normally is still to live under the shadow of clerical authority because social survival is tied to community standing media and public documentation as external corroboration mainstream media investigations have periodically focused on points where bohra internal norms collide with public law and ethics especially fgm khatna and excommunication reporting repeatedly notes two themes the difficulty outsiders have in observing the community because of restricted access to sermons and spaces and the fear insiders describe when asked to speak publicly both themes are relevant to cult analysis in high control settings secrecy is not merely privacy it is a method of preventing external scrutiny and internal comparison fgm reporting is particularly important because it treats obedience as measurable if a harmful practice persists across countries and legal regimes that suggests that internal authority is powerful enough to override external deterrents critics cite the instruction that it must be done as precisely the kind of directive that transforms private conscience into compliance the persistence of khatna is therefore not only a human rights issue it is a window into how command authority operates in everyday life and how communal enforcement can override personal judgment media attention has also focused on leadership wealth ceremonial grandeur and the opacity of finances while individual articles may vary in tone critics emphasize that the very need for investigative reporting indicates a structural problem ordinary members often cannot audit leadership claims internally so outsiders become the only check in high control groups external scrutiny is frequently treated as hostility and internal members are trained to distrust critical reporting this can produce a closed feedback loop where only leadership approved information is considered legitimate detailed mapping to lifton s eight criteria robert jay lifton s well known criteria developed in the context of thought reform are often used as a structured checklist critics argue the bohra system aligns with many of them in recognizable form milieu control critic accounts emphasize restricted access to sermons discouragement of critical literature and heavy reliance on internal messaging channels by controlling who hears what and in what setting leadership can shape the social atmosphere in which beliefs are formed and reinforced mystical manipulation the syedna is framed as the divinely guided representative of the hidden imam so ordinary administrative directives are presented with spiritual weight the requirement of raza for life decisions is cited as a practical expression of mystical manipulation mundane choices are treated as spiritually contingent on leader approval demand for purity uniform dress discipline expectations and the moralization of obedience create a purity narrative dissent is treated not as difference but as impurity that threatens the community confession although not always formalized as public confession critics describe repeated demands to explain oneself to authorities to seek permissions and to demonstrate loyalty including loyalty forms and oaths during disputes the social environment can function as an ongoing confession mechanism sacred science the leader s position as qur an e natiq living quran and the sacralizing of walayah are cited as examples of doctrine presented as unquestionable truth with leadership as the ultimate interpretive authority loaded language terms like farmaan raza mithaq and baraat are not neutral they encode obedience as virtue and dissent as deviance compressing moral judgment into everyday speech doctrine over person where members are expected to shun loved ones accept voiding of marriages or comply with harmful practices because leadership commands it doctrine is placed above personal conscience and human bonds the instruction that khatna it must be done is frequently cited as an example where doctrine overrides bodily autonomy and legal standards dispensing of existence baraat and social boycott function as the clearest example the dissenter is treated as socially dead and the community is instructed to behave as if the person does not exist critics argue that even if one disputes the intensity of any single criterion the accumulation across criteria is what matters a group may have strong leadership without being a cult it may have distinctive dress without being a cult it may practice communal cohesion without being a cult the cult like pattern emerges when leadership exaltation totalistic control economic leverage information restriction and punitive exit costs operate together as a system additional quotes and formulations used by critics because the debate often turns on specifics critics repeatedly return to particular formulations and reported slogans to ground the analysis the allegation that a syedna was called elahul ard god on earth is cited as shorthand for leader deification the reported requirement that followers describe themselves as slave of syedna and that the syedna s authority extends over soul mind body and properties is cited as shorthand for total submission the label qur an e natiq living quran is cited as shorthand for sacred authority that overrides ordinary interpretation together these specifics are used not as rhetorical flourishes but as examples of how high control mechanisms are normalized within a religious frame critics argue that where such language becomes ordinary it becomes difficult for members to even imagine a different religious life which is precisely what cult scholars mean by bounded choice comparisons with cult frameworks comparing the dawoodi bohra system to major frameworks yields substantial overlap charismatic unquestionable leadership the syedna is treated as divinely appointed and above challenge concrete examples and allegations of leader elevation include elahul ard god on earth the requirement that members describe themselves as slave of syedna and the framing of the leader as qur an e natiq living quran these phrases function as evidence that the leader is treated not as a fallible scholar but as the living axis of truth and salvation totalistic control and milieu control the expectation of raza for major life decisions combined with closed instruction corresponds to control of social and informational context closed sermons restricted access to religious spaces and discouragement of critical materials align with environment and information control sacred science and doctrine over person walayah as paramount and the mithaq oath bind identity to obedience turning dissent into spiritual betrayal the instruction on khatna that it must be done is a direct example of doctrine overriding law ethics and bodily autonomy us vs them boundaries distinct dress internal language restricted spaces and relationship norms reinforce a bounded identity and reduce external influence this increases dependence on the group and makes alternative social worlds feel inaccessible exploitation and financial coercion multiple dues opaque assessments limited oversight and access tied to compliance match patterns of economic leverage in cultic groups fear of leaving and dispensing of existence excommunication shunning and family rupture create severe exit costs and produce bounded choice leaving is possible in theory but socially catastrophic in practice taken together the overlap with lifton singer and lalich s criteria is strong the combination of leader exaltation behavioral regulation financial opacity information restriction and severe punishment for dissent is consistent with high control cult dynamics conclusion assessing the dawoodi bohra community through established cult frameworks yields a consistent picture the group exhibits multiple hallmark features of a high control system leadership is centralized and sacralized to an extreme degree with concrete examples and allegations of leader exaltation including elahul ard god on earth slave of syedna soul mind body and properties and qur an e natiq living quran theology elevates loyalty to the d through walayah and binds members through the mithaq oath taken from youth framing dissent as betrayal rather than conscience behaviorally critics describe a system of permission seeking raza uniformity enforcement boundary maintenance and peer surveillance that matches classic high control patterns information is shaped through closed sermons and discouragement of dissenting material financially critics describe multiple obligatory dues opaque assessments claims that property belonged to the syedna and economic gatekeeping that can affect access to communal life most decisively the treatment of dissenters is described as punitive and socially annihilating baraat excommunication boycotts family rupture and denial of communal rites singer lalich and the of the claim margaret singer s descriptions of coercive persuasion and janja lalich s later synthesis are often cited by ex members because they translate cult into lived experience who controls relationships information money identity and exit former bohras have explicitly compared their upbringing to lalich style checklists a commonly repeated statement in ex member discussions is that the community meets of the characteristics in such lists the number is not offered as a scientific measurement it is used as shorthand to express that most control markers feel familiar to those who left several elements in those checklists map directly onto the allegations described above the leader is treated as the center of devotion and as beyond accountability doubt is discouraged and reframed as spiritual weakness or betrayal members are expected to devote disproportionate time to sanctioned rituals gatherings and obedience demonstrations the group is separative reinforced by dress closed spaces and internal language and identity becomes fused with the community so that leaving feels like losing one s whole world critics also highlight that a group can be high control even without stereotypes that dominate popular culture the dawoodi bohras largely grow through birth and endogamy rather than aggressive public recruitment and members often live in ordinary neighborhoods rather than isolated compounds but recruitment and geography are not required features in academic typologies retention can be achieved through childhood conditioning oath mechanisms mithaq constant reinforcement that obedience equals salvation and severe penalties for dissent and exit ex members emphasize that the strongest evidence of coercive control is not a single rule but the combined effect of many constraints the need for approvals the fear of reputational damage the threat of being denied communal rites and the knowledge that family ties can be weaponized through mandated social boycott in that environment compliance can look like free choice from the outside while being experienced as necessity from the inside some former members describe the system as self sealing when criticism arises it is dismissed as hostile propaganda when a member suffers the suffering is framed as a test of loyalty when doubt appears it is framed as spiritual illness to be cured through deeper submission this pattern matters because it reduces the role of evidence if every counterexample is reinterpreted as proof that the leader is right then ordinary mechanisms of self correction are disabled synthesis and final emphasis the core argument advanced by critics can be stated plainly a system becomes cult like when it fuses religious meaning to leader obedience makes leadership approval necessary for ordinary life punishes dissent with social annihilation and protects doctrine and finances from internal scrutiny the quoted formulations elahul ard god on earth slave of syedna qur an e natiq living quran soul mind body and properties you can t literally breathe without their permission and the

86,Hizb ut-Tahrir calls to ‘organise a state’ as pressure to ban group mounts,1q9n3so,aussie,31,109,2026-01-11 02:18:32,Orgo4needfood,"Hizb ut-Tahrir operatives have told a Sydney audience that the West sucks blood from

humanity, that sharia law is the blueprint of a harmonious society, and that Islam is the only

solution for “Muslims and non-Muslims alike”.

It comes amid mounting calls to ban the organisation, with Coalition’s home affairs spokesman Jonathon Duniam declaring the group’s controversial November conference in southwest Sydney should have not have gone ahead, labelling it “simply unacceptable” that the federal government did not step in to stop it.

The group’s national conference, held just three weeks before the Bondi terror attack, puts further pressure on the Albanese government, which is facing calls to list Hizb ut-Tahrir as a terror group, as it has been in the UK.

Several speakers at the November 23 conference titled Islam: The Change the World Desperately Needs, held at Bankstown’s The Highline Venue, slammed the impacts of Western civilisation, accusing capitalism of weakening the influence of Islam.

One unnamed speaker, standing in front of a destroyed building in Gaza, delivered a video message.

“They have seen how the slogans of freedom, democracy and human rights are nothing but a mask for an ugly face hidden by their politicians, the masters of colonialism,” the speaker said.

“The West possesses only one value: sucking blood and draining the wealth of humanity.

“Even if it means standing atop mountains of skulls, rivers of blood, and paths of crushed bones.”

He then called for the overthrow of Western influence.

“Muslims are the only ones who possess a civilisational project capable of removing capitalism from its global leadership and taking its place to illuminate the world anew,” the speaker said.

“The West fears our civilisational project, it has incited regimes against us.”

Another Hizb ut-Tahrir member, Wassim Doureihi, spoke about the establishment of a Muslim state.

“Brothers and sisters, please, the time to talk about Khilafah (Caliphate) is over. The time to work for Khilafah is now.

“Do the work… don’t do the talk. We are not happy trying to organise conferences. We are in the business of trying to organise a state.

“The time for talk is over.”

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has said he was “disgusted” by Hizb ut-Tahrir.

“This organisation has been propagating hate for decades and I’ve been publicly opposed to them my whole career,” Mr Burke said.

  
Hizb ut-Tahrir is deemed a terrorist organisation in the UK, Germany, India, Indonesia and many other countries, but Australia has been slow to outlaw the group – something Mr Burke said could soon change.

“No government has been able to ban them as they didn’t meet the violence threshold,” Mr Burke said.

“The government is lowering the threshold, which means organisations which hate Australia and hate Australians will soon be able to be banned.”

Mr Duniam said the conference should not have been allowed to go ahead.

“The Albanese government has been soft on radical Islamist groups and preachers,” Mr Duniam said.

“It is simply unacceptable that they did not stop this conference.”

In his Lowy Lecture last November, ASIO boss Mike Burgess called out Hizb ut-Tahrir as a security risk and said its Australian-based chapters warranted broader scrutiny.

“Hizb ut Tahrir wants to test and stretch the boundaries of legality without breaking them… this does not make its behaviour acceptable,” he said.

“I fear its anti-Israel rhetoric is fuelling and normalising wider anti-Semitic narratives.”

One of the speakers was cleric Mohamad Trad, the radical preacher who attracted notoriety in 2023 after calling for a Muslim army and an Islamic state with sharia law under a “final solution”.

At the conference, Mr Trad criticised what he called Western imperialism.

“The ugly face of this capitalistic, liberal, secular, capitalist ideology. All of that has come to fruition in the eyes of the whole world In Gaza,” he said.

Later, Mr Trad told the audience there was only one alternative. “Islam, it’s the only solution. It’s the only way for Muslim and non-Muslim alike,” he told the audience.

Speaker Fenty Fitriawati told the conference capitalist economies concentrated the world’s wealth in a small elite.

“The secular capitalist colonial West, with its corporate influence, government fake paper money instruments and interest-based financial institutions has enslaved humanity with debt, inequality and greed,” she said.

The assembly was also shown video presentations calling for the liberation of “the lands and minds of Muslims from foreign systems and concepts”.

“The work is effective and the dawn of the Khilafah is approaching,” the presentations said.

Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia has been approached for comment.

NATO, UN etc. Stating that allies cannot survive without the USA - Russia rolls Europe and China is more of a threat elsewhere to other allies outside of NATO countries.

What if there was a new World order, a new Bloc formed for Military and Economic reasons that set to ensure a new stronger more Global Bloc without the USA or Israel.

The attached images in the comments, and this post detail a possible Bloc that could be made.

  
Selection criteria, and explanations;

I used Freedom in the World Ratings website, Freedom House, with their Free, Partly Free and Not Free ratings.

This was to ensure, no dictatorship countries or territories make it to the Bloc, this just so happens to cover religious state led countries that are not free. Civil rights, political rights, Women's rights, minority rights etc.

I then sourced GDP data, to focus on economic side of things - and it just happens to be that the most global set of data is 2023 as most recent years is still being gathered.

Same with population data, as I wanted to see how that balanced out for potential forces for economic and military reasons.

UN lists countries, but I also wanted to add in territories as well that have their own voting rights, economy and GDP data, as in some cases you want territories to be in the Bloc for strategic reasons.



The new Bloc, must have a similar article 5 style clause - attack one, attack all - Otherwise the whole point on proving that the developed World can do without USA and Israel is lost... 

That applies to China as well, you will see I would add and recognise Taiwan as well, this is not just about Europe being stronger, but adding a deterrent to China as well.



Based on that, I grouped all countries and territories into 4 categories;

B - Bloc, added to the new World order Bloc - full access support, military and Free trade agreements for economic support.

N - A Neutral country, not in the Bloc, but some support for Military exercises and no limits for economic interactions

D - Denylist - Zero military support, sharing of tech, intelligence - and regulated, sanction economic interactions with the aim of cutting ties as soon as possible and find different supply chain solutions.

H - Hostile - No economic interactions, and obviously no military support or exercises.

  
The % of GDP spending for a Military Budget for the Bloc, which would be in addition to each countries spending, creates a decent budget for a Bloc Army as well.

Combined manufacturing, technology, a series of Bloc standard Military hardware can be made all the way up to an Nuclear Aircraft carrier - and, for those, I selected 6 carriers in bases at strategic points around the World which are detailed in the table notes and on the World map I made.

This is theory crafting ok, so timelines would be a minimum decade for most of it to be done, but key countries if USA drops out / kicked out of NATO could be sorted out in less than a year.

I also added a Map showing all approx 750 to 780 USA bases in other countries around the World, these would all have to go, and be replaced with new Bloc bases and soldiers.

  
As you can see, USA remains Neutral and the guidelines above apply - this is assuming they calm down and re-direct from their current path of threats to Canada, Greenland etc and other countries that are current allies.

  
The last part of the What if, adds in two more variations, India and Brazil.

I added a small sub-table, that shows what happens if India moves from Neutral to Bloc Status, and then another one that shows India AND Brazil moving to Bloc status.

I was curious to see what tips the balance in favour for the new Bloc for both GDP and Population.

This essentially creates a new World Order, split into 3 groups.

1.  The New Bloc

2. USA + Israel

3. Russia, China, Iran - pretty much the current hostile countries to existing alliances

  
vs. The two main groups at the moment, but with USA pretty much Veto everything amongst allies and thinking it can do whatever it wants, that needs to change.

  
At this point, it doesn't show Military hardware, troop counts, etc per country and that would take another few weeks of me playing around to work that out, as much fun as this theory crafting has been during the holidays with a few beers, I will leave that to a later time.. but, there are plenty of comparison websites, threads, YouTube videos on this as this topic of NATO without USA and how that would work for Military hardware is discussed a lot... 

Last thing, Global currency would change within these countries from the US dollar, going away from USA also means this has to change as well... likely pick would be the EURO as it is already in the bulk of the major countries in this new Bloc and a strong currency.

Failed Precedents and Painful Consequences of Radical Extremism and Perfectionism: Taking Communist Revolutions, Excessive “Political Correctness,” the 1989 Democracy Movement / June Fourth Incident, and the Hong Kong Anti–Extradition Bill Movement as Examples

Moreover, excessive radicalism and an insistence on perfect, thorough solutions often produce the effect of “going too far and achieving the opposite.” Typical examples include the socialist and communist revolutions and subsequent construction that took place around the world in the twentieth century. In contrast to the hierarchical oppression of feudal societies and the brutal coldness of capitalist societies, socialism and communism were beautiful visions aimed at human equality and happiness, and were indeed worthy of pursuit.

Yet in the Soviet Union, China, Eastern Europe, and even Cambodia, various enormous tragedies occurred in the name of building socialist societies and realizing communist ideals. An excessive emphasis on revolutionary purity led to endless political purges and rivers of blood; an obsession with the “dictatorship of the proletariat” shackled national development with dogmatism; economic policies that ignored real conditions and objective laws caused great famines and bloated industrialization; and the promotion of uncompromising class struggle resulted in the slaughter of millions of lives.

Although these tragedies had specific causes such as power struggles and interest conflicts, they were also related to the intense pursuit—at least in name—of the fundamentalist goals within Marxist–Leninist–Maoist theory. After suffering brutal far-left disasters and political struggles, many Chinese, Russians, and Eastern Europeans later turned to extremely conservative and laissez-faire far-right paths, which was itself a case of “extremes reversing” caused by earlier far-left catastrophes.

In recent years, controversies in Western countries surrounding “political correctness” have also reflected the reality that radicalism and the pursuit of perfection can provoke backlash. “Political correctness” is a product of developed societies that have accumulated extensive experience and lessons through various historical sufferings and have evolved into highly civilized societies. Specific “politically correct” norms include opposing discrimination against or mockery of ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, transgender people, and victims of crime or disasters; opposing the promotion of hatred and resentment toward particular groups; opposing the denial of historical oppression, massacres, and enslavement of Black people and Indigenous peoples in U.S. history; and acknowledging scientific conclusions in professional fields such as the reality of climate change and the correctness of evolution.

These forms of “political correctness” are necessary both emotionally and rationally, and they help protect vulnerable groups, reduce hatred, promote social harmony, and advance science. However, excessive emphasis on “political correctness” by some radical leftists and establishment figures has triggered backlash from those who resent it. Even some people who initially accepted “political correctness,” under incessant emphasis and rigid regulation—combined with real-life interpersonal conflicts and the darker aspects of human nature—gradually came to loathe it, deliberately expressing or privately endorsing views opposed to it. One reason for Donald Trump’s successful election as U.S. president was precisely his disregard for “political correctness” and his freewheeling expression of discriminatory and hateful remarks, which resonated with and attracted support from those who detested “political correctness.”

In some specific conflict events, radicalism and uncompromising thoroughness are also easily met with backlash. For example, the 1989 democracy movement had already achieved significant results, and the Chinese Communist Party had made enormous concessions that, viewed today, are almost unimaginable. At that time, support for democratization included not only figures such as CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, but even Deng Xiaoping did not strongly oppose democracy. Deng’s political stance was similar to that of János Kádár of Hungary—an enlightened pragmatist—who wavered between moving toward democracy and maintaining authoritarian rule, attempting to find a compromise that would allow partial democracy while preserving CCP dominance. Where history would head depended on changing circumstances and, especially, real-world power struggles.

At the time, both domestic public opinion (with broad support for the democracy movement across sectors) and the international environment (the peak of the third wave of democratization, with both the United States and the Soviet Union supporting China’s democratization, and democratic forces across Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa expressing solidarity) were highly favorable to China’s democratic forces. If the Tiananmen Square protests had ended peacefully, with students and people from all walks of life broadly participating in political activities and civic movements and putting the achieved consensus on political democratization into practice, China might well have undergone a democratic transition similar to that of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe later on—perhaps even with a better outcome, had cooperation between officials and the public been effective.

However, due to the intransigence of a small number of radical actors, compromise and withdrawal were not reached in time, providing hardliners within the CCP with a pretext. Deng Xiaoping also shifted to support suppression, and in the end it was like eggs striking stone: China’s subsequent historical fate was rewritten from “hope” to “darkness.”

(It is worth noting that after the June Fourth crackdown occurred, a temporary compromise was actually reached through the mediation of Liu Xiaobo and others among the so-called “Four Gentlemen of Tiananmen,” whereby students withdrew in exchange for the cessation of repression. From the perspective of protecting life and humanitarianism, this is of course beyond reproach and worthy of praise. But it also demonstrates the essential weakness of hardline forces and the cowardice behind their high-sounding rhetoric.

On the one hand, they were hardline, yet they had not thought through what to do if violent repression truly occurred—whether they dared to sacrifice themselves, and how to make such sacrifice meaningful. Had there been no compromise after the crackdown, and had students, workers, and citizens confronted repression head-on—given that many among them had intricate ties with CCP officials at all levels, including the highest—and especially if some idealistic children of high-ranking cadres, particularly those from military families, had rushed toward tanks and gunfire and been killed or wounded, thereby dragging their parents and relatives “into the water,” then after tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of casualties, the regime might indeed have hesitated, feared, softened, halted repression, or even collapsed or fled abroad.

Even if hardliners had continued repression, it might very likely have triggered splits within the ruling group and even mutinies (at the very least, those whose children, relatives, or friends died in the repression would not all have been cold-blooded and selfish), as in the Romanian case. In that scenario, even a sacrifice of 300,000 lives could arguably have been “worth it” if it secured democratic success for China, freed billions of Chinese people then and in the future from shackles, restored their rights and dignity, and left later generations to remember the courage and merit of those sacrifices as inspiration to strive forward and defend democracy.

But the actual situation of June Fourth was that, at the life-and-death moment when repression had already occurred but not escalated further, forces including hardliners and extremists instead became fearful, retreated, abandoned the idea of “using blood to open the people’s eyes,” chose to preserve their strength, wait and see, or even flee outright, rather than press on to create a turning point. As a result, hundreds to thousands died, tens of thousands were imprisoned, democratization was aborted, and the outcome was left tragically unresolved.

Such fear at the critical moment is of course understandable—bullying the weak and fearing the strong is basic human nature, and I myself have had similar experiences. But objectively speaking, this pattern—being hardline and rejecting compromise in advance, then collapsing at the first real confrontation, losing lives and prior gains—is the worst possible outcome for a struggle.

By contrast, India’s “nonviolent noncooperation” movement, which consistently adhered to peaceful, rational, nonviolent principles from the outset, saw participants face batons and gunfire from British colonial rulers, endure brutal beatings and even the killing of comrades without retreating or losing heart, and persist relentlessly until victory was achieved (of course, this was also due to differences in the opponent’s level of civilization, and the movement’s success had multiple causes rather than relying solely on “nonviolent noncooperation”).

The Hong Kong anti–extradition bill movement was similar. Setting aside whether some of its demands were reasonable, in terms of methods and outcomes alone, large-scale peaceful demonstrations had already forced the Hong Kong government to make concessions and withdraw the Extradition Bill, achieving more concrete results than the earlier “Occupy Central” movement and demonstrating to both the Hong Kong authorities and Beijing the will and power of Hong Kong citizens.

Had matters ended there, or had subsequent resistance remained peaceful and sustained, victory in parliamentary elections and other political contests would have been entirely possible (as confirmed by the results of the 2019 Hong Kong District Council elections), and greater political space could have been expanded on the basis of such public opinion and mobilization. However, the anti–extradition bill movement gradually evolved into violent acts of smashing, looting, and arson, including indiscriminate attacks on mainland Chinese people, pro-establishment individuals, and Chinese-funded or pro-establishment businesses and shops. These were not isolated incidents but became quite widespread, providing the CCP and the Hong Kong government with a pretext for repression. From the perspective of the CCP and the Hong Kong authorities, it was also impossible to tolerate large-scale violence or to compromise and retreat, as doing so would undermine authority, lead to more violence, and, for the CCP, raise concerns about imitation on the mainland.

Thus, repression became the only option, and moderate factions within the central and Hong Kong governments found it difficult to intervene. The cornered central authorities and Hong Kong government decided to quell the situation and take the opportunity to uproot democratic forces. Consequently, the machinery of violence and various public powers were fully mobilized; peaceful demonstrations and violent actions alike were suppressed; political parties and civic organizations were eradicated; and freedom of the press, speech, and academia were all destroyed. Hong Kong was left with no space for democratic or other anti-establishment forces to operate. (As for claims that even without resistance, the Xi Jinping regime would have destroyed Hong Kong’s democratic and localist forces anyway, this could indeed have happened, but it was not inevitable; even if repression had occurred, it likely would not have been as absolute as it is now. When one side is in a weaker position, it should avoid providing the other with pretexts for attack as much as possible.)

That said, whether in the case of the 1989 democracy movement or the anti–extradition bill movement, excessive radicalism and a failure to “know when to stop” were not the primary causes of failure, nor the only causes. Fundamentally, repression by the ruling group was the decisive factor. And even if compromise had been made, it might not necessarily have been met with compromise in return.

The CCP could just as well have used compromise—especially the termination of the movement and the dispersal of the public—as an opportunity to suppress grassroots forces that had already gained momentum and posed a threat to the regime, making it easier to defeat them one by one. The failure of “Occupy Central” can be seen as an example where peaceful assembly and dispersal did not yield optimal results. Although it had some impact, it clearly failed with regard to its two most important demands—“genuine universal suffrage” and “dual universal suffrage.”

If the 1989 democracy movement had “known when to stop,” it would certainly have achieved some results, but it might not have fundamentally altered one-party dictatorship. Limited freedoms and rights could have been reclaimed at any time by conservatives. If the people did not resist but instead endured passively, dictators who bully the weak and fear the strong might have become even more ruthless. As seen over the past three decades, despite widespread political apathy and minimal resistance among Chinese people, the stability maintenance apparatus grew increasingly strong in the later Hu–Wen period, and under Xi Jinping even the semblance of “peaceful, uneventful lives” has been denied to most ordinary people.

Thus, “the tree may wish to be still, but the wind does not stop.” When democratic forces are strongest, morale is highest, and mobilization and participation are widest, failing to seize the momentum and instead deflating oneself is also unlikely to produce good results. Had that path been taken, the CCP might have made some short-term concessions without abandoning authoritarianism, and later—due to changes in internal and external environments and political struggles—conservatives could have gained the upper hand, intensified authoritarianism, and divided and suppressed the democracy movement. The people, unable to regroup, would have been defeated piecemeal, and democracy would remain distant. In that case, today’s histories and commentaries might instead say that “the 1989 democracy movement failed to press forward and persist to the end, compromised and retreated, and thus missed a historic opportunity for China’s full democratization, laying the groundwork for later conservative forces to return to power and reimpose authoritarian oppression.”

During and after the anti–extradition bill movement, Xi Jinping steadily intensified authoritarianism and was unlikely to tolerate Hong Kong—a special administrative region under CCP control—acting independently and openly criticizing him and the CCP regime. Thus, even without intense resistance, Hong Kong people might have been gradually constrained through “boiling the frog slowly”–style repression, ultimately arriving at much the same outcome as today. It is hard to imagine that Xi Jinping and other power holders, amid extreme regression on the mainland, would tolerate Hong Kong holding annual political vigils commemorating June Fourth, or daily public political activities and media discourse openly opposing him and the CCP.

In sum, historical change is influenced by many variables. A change in one variable does not necessarily determine whether a particular outcome will or will not occur. Altering one variable can directly or indirectly alter others, and changing a single variable may well lead to outcomes just as bad, or even worse, than if it had remained unchanged. Compromise and moderation are necessary, but it is also wrong to attribute the failure of movements solely to protesters’ lack of compromise.)


The Pursuit of Radicalism and Perfection Can Be Maliciously Exploited and Invite Backlash: Taking Historical Reform Movements, the Distinction Between Corruption and “Political Donations,” the Different Evils of “Power” and “Capital,” Animal Protection, and the Evaluation of Political Figures as Examples

Excessive pursuit of radicalism and perfection can also be exploited by those who obstruct reform. Throughout history, when central governments have introduced policies intended to benefit the people, lower-level officials—fearing damage to their vested interests—have often attempted to resist them. They dare not openly oppose such policies, but instead push their implementation to extremes, causing good policies to produce harmful consequences and provoke strong resentment from all sides, thereby achieving their goal of blocking or overturning the policies.

Whether in various reform movements of ancient times (such as the reforms of Wang Anshi or the Hundred Days’ Reform) or in the numerous reforms and rectifications of today (healthcare reform, education reform, fiscal and tax reform), vested interest groups frequently and deliberately drive policy implementation toward extremes in order to force higher authorities to retreat or even abolish the policies. (Of course, some extreme measures are not driven by this motive—for example, Shandong’s “hundred days without births,” Beijing’s expulsion of the so-called “low-end population,” and the recent high-intensity COVID controls—these were not cases of lower levels intentionally pushing extremes to compel upper levels to halt policies, but rather of deliberately exerting force upward to curry favor with superiors, discipline the populace, and display official authority in order to gain benefits.)

Overemphasis on perfection also blurs differences in the degree of good and bad, and in the scale of gains and losses. It treats systems, policies, ideas, and events that are all imperfect but differ markedly in degree, as well as individuals or groups that all have flaws but where some are clearly “flawed warriors” and others merely “flies,” as uniformly “bad” or “evil,” asserting that “all crows are black.”

For example, it equates regulated and supervised “political donations” under democratic systems with corruption under authoritarian rule; it draws an equivalence between the relative economic tightness of ordinary people in developed countries and the struggle of Chinese citizens for basic food, clothing, housing, and transportation; and it compares limited speech restrictions in rule-of-law and free societies with the tight, comprehensive censorship of totalitarian systems.

Such positions may appear to reflect moral rigor and intolerance of evil (though some are deliberately malicious), but they inevitably lead to the situation described by the saying “when water is too pure, there are no fish; when people are too exacting, they have no companions.” They weaken enthusiasm and support for the relatively better side, allow those who are relatively worse, more evil, and more harmful to evade the proportionally greater condemnation and punishment they deserve, obstruct limited but valuable progress, and deprive further reform efforts of their foundation and stepping stones.

This is similar to how people in China often denounce the evils of capital and capitalists, while rarely mentioning the fact that capital is relatively gentler than power, and capitalists relatively less brutal than bureaucrats—thereby causing the more dangerous evil of power to be ignored or downplayed. Likewise, those who criticize the many problems of the reform and opening-up era often obscure the far darker and more desperate historical reality of the Mao era.

Opponents of animal protection often criticize animal welfare advocates for loving cats and dogs but not chickens, ducks, fish, pigs, or cattle (and if they claim to care about those, critics then ask why they do not also protect rats, flies, mosquitoes, or even bacteria and viruses). In this way, they deconstruct the value and necessity of protecting some animals, deliberately using rigid and partial logic (rather than a complete and systematic rationale) to negate the compromises that animal protectors make based on reality.

Beyond evaluating events, when judging historical figures, it is likewise inappropriate to criticize as equivalent those who all committed wrongs or crimes but whose degrees of culpability differ markedly. Figures such as Chiang Kai-shek, Deng Xiaoping, and Park Chung-hee, while authoritarian and responsible for the killing of innocents, also achieved certain economic and social accomplishments.

If they are lumped together with figures such as Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung—whose crimes were extreme—and all are labeled simply as cruel dictators, this may not be entirely indefensible, but it objectively downplays the evils of the latter group and erases the contributions of the former in certain domains. Such an approach, which fails to distinguish degrees of right and wrong, depth, and severity, is clearly unfavorable to an objective and comprehensive reflection of complex historical realities, and to accurate judgment and appropriate differentiation in dealing with historical figures.

Furthermore, under the effect of “extremes reversing,” when perfectionist goals fail, former adherents are likely to lose confidence entirely and become cynical or withdraw from society, unwilling even to participate in incremental reform, thereby pushing reality even farther from ideals. This is similar to how the failure of extreme communist policies led many people in those countries to develop a generalized aversion to all left-wing and progressive ideas.

The tragedies of the Cultural Revolution and June Fourth also lie in this post-failure conservatization. After the failures of the Cultural Revolution and the 1986 student movement and the 1989 democracy movement, Chinese intellectuals—and indeed large segments of the public—who had once been passionate about politics largely chose to withdraw, becoming refined egoists. The popularity since the 1990s of ideas such as “farewell to revolution” and “getting rich quietly” is precisely the product of failed radical demands and the collapse of corresponding political ideals. These outcomes are exactly what reform blockers and major wrongdoers hope to see and actively promote.

Extremism and the Pursuit of Perfection Often Come at the Expense of Others, Groups, Goals, or Values: Taking the Development of Heavy Industry in “Socialist States,” the “Dynamic Zero-COVID” Policy, WikiLeaks’ Disclosure of State Secrets, Radical Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Early Twentieth-Century China, and the Failures of the Two Ancient Emperors Wang Mang and Yang Guang as Examples

Extremism and thoroughness may appear “perfect,” but they are only “perfect” or victorious for certain specific goals or groups. For society as a whole and for broader, more diverse populations, they instead represent harm and failure—and they often rebound against the very goals they seek to achieve at all costs. This is because pursuing the perfection of one goal or insisting on the full realization of certain groups’ interests almost inevitably comes at the expense of other goals and by encroaching upon others’ interests.

For example, when countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea concentrated their resources on developing heavy industry, they consumed resources needed by other sectors, hindered the normal development of light industry and services, and turned peasants into “blood donors” and “sacrificial victims.” This led to distorted economic structures and an inability to meet citizens’ everyday needs for light industrial goods, agricultural products, and services, becoming an important cause of eventual economic collapse and systemic sclerosis.

Since the founding of the People’s Republic, various departments and localities have pursued “showcase projects” and enforced “one-size-fits-all” policies for the sake of political performance or to curry favor with leaders. While achieving certain objectives, these actions have inflicted even greater harm on people’s livelihoods. Similarly, in recent years China’s “dynamic zero-COVID” policy—centered on high-intensity lockdowns and quarantines—did indeed curb the spread of the virus, but it severely infringed on personal freedoms, damaged economic development, and caused tangible and intangible losses far exceeding the harm caused by COVID itself.

The actions of “extreme information libertarians” such as Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, and Julian Assange—publicly disclosing nearly all secrets they knew and advocating complete transparency of governments and politics—have undoubtedly helped expose the dark sides of U.S. and global politics and the infringement of citizens’ privacy through the combination of state power and big data. Yet extreme information libertarianism inevitably undermines counterterrorism and national security, damages international political operations and diplomatic relations, produces various negative effects, and in turn becomes a pretext for restricting information freedom.

In China after the Xinhai Revolution, the movements of “national salvation and enlightenment” surged. People broadly regarded resisting foreign invasion and colonialism externally, and pursuing democracy and prosperity internally, as firm and non-negotiable goals. In principle, this was of course correct. However, excessive nationalist tendencies—such as blind boycotts of foreign goods, harassment of foreigners in China (though many actions were self-defense), and the adoption of extremely exclusionary slogans—led to the deterioration of relations between China and the great powers, especially Japan.

Facing a neighboring and powerful Japan, Chinese citizens adopted radical anti-Japanese attitudes and pressured the Nationalist government to take a hard line. China’s radical nationalism, from a position of weakness, stimulated even more extreme Japanese nationalism and militarism, pushing the two nations into confrontation and making peaceful coexistence impossible, accelerating Japan’s invasion of China. As a result, China’s democratic development and economic and social progress were destroyed by the War of Resistance Against Japan and its aftermath.

Of course, the fundamental fault and crimes lay with Japan. Yet had there been room for compromise—had the Chinese people chosen to “bide their time and build strength” rather than loudly opposing imperialism and Japan, emphasized self-strengthening over excessive rigidity from a position of weakness—China might have avoided a series of subsequent disasters, history might have taken a different course, and Sino-Japanese relations would not have become as profoundly distorted as they are today. If one looks only at Sino-Japanese official and popular relations and interactions before the September 18 Incident and even the August 13 Incident, Japan actually rendered considerable assistance to China, especially to the Han Chinese, such as promoting the anti-Qing national democratic revolution and serving as an intermediary for the transmission of Western modern civilization.

After Japan’s invasion of China, especially the Nanjing Massacre, however, everything became irreparable. Even after diplomatic normalization, the relationship remained profoundly unhealthy and distorted. Japan’s support for the CCP’s dictatorship further destroyed any genuine friendship between China and Japan, a tragedy for both countries, and especially for China. The boycotts of Japanese goods and expulsions of Japanese nationals from 1919 to 1937 did not make China stronger or more prosperous; instead, they intensified Sino-Japanese antagonism.

By contrast, after reform and opening up, China’s comprehensive importation of Japanese goods and invitation for Japanese nationals to work and live in China effectively declared the failure and futility of the struggles a century earlier—losing both dignity and practical benefit. (Conversely, had China followed a path more like South Korea’s—focusing first on self-strengthening rather than boycotts, and only after strengthening itself pursuing autonomy and “rooted development”—it might have truly developed its national economy and safeguarded the interests of its people.)

History also offers many examples of feudal rulers driven by grandiose ambitions who spared no cost to pursue certain goals, such as Wang Mang, who forcibly implemented comprehensive political and social reforms, and Yang Guang, who was obsessed with massive construction projects and foreign campaigns. Some of their goals may have been well-intentioned and even had positive significance, but by disregarding real constraints and paying any political, economic, and livelihood cost, they provoked widespread rebellion and universal defection. By the time they abandoned their goals, it was already too late; their states collapsed and they themselves perished.

Their fates also demonstrate that excessive pursuit of narrow goals and self-interest, and an insistence on “perfection,” are often overly difficult and costly, especially as they provoke backlash from numerous groups whose interests are harmed. In the end, everything falls apart: not only are radical goals unattainable, but even preserving or restoring the former, imperfect state becomes impossible.

Failed Precedents and Painful Consequences of Radical Extremism and Perfectionism: Taking Communist Revolutions, Excessive “Political Correctness,” the 1989 Democracy Movement / June Fourth Incident, and the Hong Kong Anti–Extradition Bill Movement as Examples

Moreover, excessive radicalism and an insistence on perfect, thorough solutions often produce the effect of “going too far and achieving the opposite.” Typical examples include the socialist and communist revolutions and subsequent construction that took place around the world in the twentieth century. In contrast to the hierarchical oppression of feudal societies and the brutal coldness of capitalist societies, socialism and communism were beautiful visions aimed at human equality and happiness, and were indeed worthy of pursuit.

Yet in the Soviet Union, China, Eastern Europe, and even Cambodia, various enormous tragedies occurred in the name of building socialist societies and realizing communist ideals. An excessive emphasis on revolutionary purity led to endless political purges and rivers of blood; an obsession with the “dictatorship of the proletariat” shackled national development with dogmatism; economic policies that ignored real conditions and objective laws caused great famines and bloated industrialization; and the promotion of uncompromising class struggle resulted in the slaughter of millions of lives.

Although these tragedies had specific causes such as power struggles and interest conflicts, they were also related to the intense pursuit—at least in name—of the fundamentalist goals within Marxist–Leninist–Maoist theory. After suffering brutal far-left disasters and political struggles, many Chinese, Russians, and Eastern Europeans later turned to extremely conservative and laissez-faire far-right paths, which was itself a case of “extremes reversing” caused by earlier far-left catastrophes.

In recent years, controversies in Western countries surrounding “political correctness” have also reflected the reality that radicalism and the pursuit of perfection can provoke backlash. “Political correctness” is a product of developed societies that have accumulated extensive experience and lessons through various historical sufferings and have evolved into highly civilized societies. Specific “politically correct” norms include opposing discrimination against or mockery of ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, transgender people, and victims of crime or disasters; opposing the promotion of hatred and resentment toward particular groups; opposing the denial of historical oppression, massacres, and enslavement of Black people and Indigenous peoples in U.S. history; and acknowledging scientific conclusions in professional fields such as the reality of climate change and the correctness of evolution.

These forms of “political correctness” are necessary both emotionally and rationally, and they help protect vulnerable groups, reduce hatred, promote social harmony, and advance science. However, excessive emphasis on “political correctness” by some radical leftists and establishment figures has triggered backlash from those who resent it. Even some people who initially accepted “political correctness,” under incessant emphasis and rigid regulation—combined with real-life interpersonal conflicts and the darker aspects of human nature—gradually came to loathe it, deliberately expressing or privately endorsing views opposed to it. One reason for Donald Trump’s successful election as U.S. president was precisely his disregard for “political correctness” and his freewheeling expression of discriminatory and hateful remarks, which resonated with and attracted support from those who detested “political correctness.”

In some specific conflict events, radicalism and uncompromising thoroughness are also easily met with backlash. For example, the 1989 democracy movement had already achieved significant results, and the Chinese Communist Party had made enormous concessions that, viewed today, are almost unimaginable. At that time, support for democratization included not only figures such as CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, but even Deng Xiaoping did not strongly oppose democracy. Deng’s political stance was similar to that of János Kádár of Hungary—an enlightened pragmatist—who wavered between moving toward democracy and maintaining authoritarian rule, attempting to find a compromise that would allow partial democracy while preserving CCP dominance. Where history would head depended on changing circumstances and, especially, real-world power struggles.

At the time, both domestic public opinion (with broad support for the democracy movement across sectors) and the international environment (the peak of the third wave of democratization, with both the United States and the Soviet Union supporting China’s democratization, and democratic forces across Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa expressing solidarity) were highly favorable to China’s democratic forces. If the Tiananmen Square protests had ended peacefully, with students and people from all walks of life broadly participating in political activities and civic movements and putting the achieved consensus on political democratization into practice, China might well have undergone a democratic transition similar to that of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe later on—perhaps even with a better outcome, had cooperation between officials and the public been effective.

However, due to the intransigence of a small number of radical actors, compromise and withdrawal were not reached in time, providing hardliners within the CCP with a pretext. Deng Xiaoping also shifted to support suppression, and in the end it was like eggs striking stone: China’s subsequent historical fate was rewritten from “hope” to “darkness.”

(It is worth noting that after the June Fourth crackdown occurred, a temporary compromise was actually reached through the mediation of Liu Xiaobo and others among the so-called “Four Gentlemen of Tiananmen,” whereby students withdrew in exchange for the cessation of repression. From the perspective of protecting life and humanitarianism, this is of course beyond reproach and worthy of praise. But it also demonstrates the essential weakness of hardline forces and the cowardice behind their high-sounding rhetoric.

On the one hand, they were hardline, yet they had not thought through what to do if violent repression truly occurred—whether they dared to sacrifice themselves, and how to make such sacrifice meaningful. Had there been no compromise after the crackdown, and had students, workers, and citizens confronted repression head-on—given that many among them had intricate ties with CCP officials at all levels, including the highest—and especially if some idealistic children of high-ranking cadres, particularly those from military families, had rushed toward tanks and gunfire and been killed or wounded, thereby dragging their parents and relatives “into the water,” then after tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of casualties, the regime might indeed have hesitated, feared, softened, halted repression, or even collapsed or fled abroad.

Even if hardliners had continued repression, it might very likely have triggered splits within the ruling group and even mutinies (at the very least, those whose children, relatives, or friends died in the repression would not all have been cold-blooded and selfish), as in the Romanian case. In that scenario, even a sacrifice of 300,000 lives could arguably have been “worth it” if it secured democratic success for China, freed billions of Chinese people then and in the future from shackles, restored their rights and dignity, and left later generations to remember the courage and merit of those sacrifices as inspiration to strive forward and defend democracy.

But the actual situation of June Fourth was that, at the life-and-death moment when repression had already occurred but not escalated further, forces including hardliners and extremists instead became fearful, retreated, abandoned the idea of “using blood to open the people’s eyes,” chose to preserve their strength, wait and see, or even flee outright, rather than press on to create a turning point. As a result, hundreds to thousands died, tens of thousands were imprisoned, democratization was aborted, and the outcome was left tragically unresolved.

Such fear at the critical moment is of course understandable—bullying the weak and fearing the strong is basic human nature, and I myself have had similar experiences. But objectively speaking, this pattern—being hardline and rejecting compromise in advance, then collapsing at the first real confrontation, losing lives and prior gains—is the worst possible outcome for a struggle.

By contrast, India’s “nonviolent noncooperation” movement, which consistently adhered to peaceful, rational, nonviolent principles from the outset, saw participants face batons and gunfire from British colonial rulers, endure brutal beatings and even the killing of comrades without retreating or losing heart, and persist relentlessly until victory was achieved (of course, this was also due to differences in the opponent’s level of civilization, and the movement’s success had multiple causes rather than relying solely on “nonviolent noncooperation”).

The Hong Kong anti–extradition bill movement was similar. Setting aside whether some of its demands were reasonable, in terms of methods and outcomes alone, large-scale peaceful demonstrations had already forced the Hong Kong government to make concessions and withdraw the Extradition Bill, achieving more concrete results than the earlier “Occupy Central” movement and demonstrating to both the Hong Kong authorities and Beijing the will and power of Hong Kong citizens.

Overemphasis on perfection also blurs differences in the degree of good and bad, and in the scale of gains and losses. It treats systems, policies, ideas, and events that are all imperfect but differ markedly in degree, as well as individuals or groups that all have flaws but where some are clearly “flawed warriors” and others merely “flies,” as uniformly “bad” or “evil,” asserting that “all crows are black.”

The tragedies of the Cultural Revolution and June Fourth also lie in this post-failure conservatization. After the failures of the Cultural Revolution and the 1986 student movement and the 1989 democracy movement, Chinese intellectuals—and indeed large segments of the public—who had once been passionate about politics largely chose to withdraw, becoming refined egoists. The popularity since the 1990s of ideas such as “farewell to revolution” and “getting rich quietly” is precisely the product of failed radical demands and the collapse of corresponding political ideals. These outcomes are exactly what reform blockers and major wrongdoers hope to see and actively promote.

Extremism and the Pursuit of Perfection Often Come at the Expense of Others, Groups, Goals, or Values: Taking the Development of Heavy Industry in “Socialist States,” the “Dynamic Zero-COVID” Policy, WikiLeaks’ Disclosure of State Secrets, Radical Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Early Twentieth-Century China, and the Failures of the Two Ancient Emperors Wang Mang and Yang Guang as Examples

Extremism and thoroughness may appear “perfect,” but they are only “perfect” or victorious for certain specific goals or groups. For society as a whole and for broader, more diverse populations, they instead represent harm and failure—and they often rebound against the very goals they seek to achieve at all costs. This is because pursuing the perfection of one goal or insisting on the full realization of certain groups’ interests almost inevitably comes at the expense of other goals and by encroaching upon others’ interests.

For example, when countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea concentrated their resources on developing heavy industry, they consumed resources needed by other sectors, hindered the normal development of light industry and services, and turned peasants into “blood donors” and “sacrificial victims.” This led to distorted economic structures and an inability to meet citizens’ everyday needs for light industrial goods, agricultural products, and services, becoming an important cause of eventual economic collapse and systemic sclerosis.

Since the founding of the People’s Republic, various departments and localities have pursued “showcase projects” and enforced “one-size-fits-all” policies for the sake of political performance or to curry favor with leaders. While achieving certain objectives, these actions have inflicted even greater harm on people’s livelihoods. Similarly, in recent years China’s “dynamic zero-COVID” policy—centered on high-intensity lockdowns and quarantines—did indeed curb the spread of the virus, but it severely infringed on personal freedoms, damaged economic development, and caused tangible and intangible losses far exceeding the harm caused by COVID itself.

The actions of “extreme information libertarians” such as Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, and Julian Assange—publicly disclosing nearly all secrets they knew and advocating complete transparency of governments and politics—have undoubtedly helped expose the dark sides of U.S. and global politics and the infringement of citizens’ privacy through the combination of state power and big data. Yet extreme information libertarianism inevitably undermines counterterrorism and national security, damages international political operations and diplomatic relations, produces various negative effects, and in turn becomes a pretext for restricting information freedom.

In China after the Xinhai Revolution, the movements of “national salvation and enlightenment” surged. People broadly regarded resisting foreign invasion and colonialism externally, and pursuing democracy and prosperity internally, as firm and non-negotiable goals. In principle, this was of course correct. However, excessive nationalist tendencies—such as blind boycotts of foreign goods, harassment of foreigners in China (though many actions were self-defense), and the adoption of extremely exclusionary slogans—led to the deterioration of relations between China and the great powers, especially Japan.

Facing a neighboring and powerful Japan, Chinese citizens adopted radical anti-Japanese attitudes and pressured the Nationalist government to take a hard line. China’s radical nationalism, from a position of weakness, stimulated even more extreme Japanese nationalism and militarism, pushing the two nations into confrontation and making peaceful coexistence impossible, accelerating Japan’s invasion of China. As a result, China’s democratic development and economic and social progress were destroyed by the War of Resistance Against Japan and its aftermath.

Of course, the fundamental fault and crimes lay with Japan. Yet had there been room for compromise—had the Chinese people chosen to “bide their time and build strength” rather than loudly opposing imperialism and Japan, emphasized self-strengthening over excessive rigidity from a position of weakness—China might have avoided a series of subsequent disasters, history might have taken a different course, and Sino-Japanese relations would not have become as profoundly distorted as they are today. If one looks only at Sino-Japanese official and popular relations and interactions before the September 18 Incident and even the August 13 Incident, Japan actually rendered considerable assistance to China, especially to the Han Chinese, such as promoting the anti-Qing national democratic revolution and serving as an intermediary for the transmission of Western modern civilization.

After Japan’s invasion of China, especially the Nanjing Massacre, however, everything became irreparable. Even after diplomatic normalization, the relationship remained profoundly unhealthy and distorted. Japan’s support for the CCP’s dictatorship further destroyed any genuine friendship between China and Japan, a tragedy for both countries, and especially for China. The boycotts of Japanese goods and expulsions of Japanese nationals from 1919 to 1937 did not make China stronger or more prosperous; instead, they intensified Sino-Japanese antagonism.

By contrast, after reform and opening up, China’s comprehensive importation of Japanese goods and invitation for Japanese nationals to work and live in China effectively declared the failure and futility of the struggles a century earlier—losing both dignity and practical benefit. (Conversely, had China followed a path more like South Korea’s—focusing first on self-strengthening rather than boycotts, and only after strengthening itself pursuing autonomy and “rooted development”—it might have truly developed its national economy and safeguarded the interests of its people.)

History also offers many examples of feudal rulers driven by grandiose ambitions who spared no cost to pursue certain goals, such as Wang Mang, who forcibly implemented comprehensive political and social reforms, and Yang Guang, who was obsessed with massive construction projects and foreign campaigns. Some of their goals may have been well-intentioned and even had positive significance, but by disregarding real constraints and paying any political, economic, and livelihood cost, they provoked widespread rebellion and universal defection. By the time they abandoned their goals, it was already too late; their states collapsed and they themselves perished.

Their fates also demonstrate that excessive pursuit of narrow goals and self-interest, and an insistence on “perfection,” are often overly difficult and costly, especially as they provoke backlash from numerous groups whose interests are harmed. In the end, everything falls apart: not only are radical goals unattainable, but even preserving or restoring the former, imperfect state becomes impossible.

“Full moons wane, and overflowing water spills”—this wisdom has been passed down for thousands of years, yet later generations continue to repeat the same mistakes, which is truly heartbreaking.",compromisism the least bad choice for china s path of transformation taking bankruptcy of comm backlash against political correctness failure of and hk anti extradition bill over implementation of reform policies scope of animal prot and evaluation of political figures failed precedents and painful consequences of radical extremism and perfectionism taking communist revolutions excessive political correctness the democracy movement june fourth incident and the hong kong anti extradition bill movement as examples moreover excessive radicalism and an insistence on perfect thorough solutions often produce the effect of going too far and achieving the opposite typical examples include the socialist and communist revolutions and subsequent construction that took place around the world in the twentieth century in contrast to the hierarchical oppression of feudal societies and the brutal coldness of capitalist societies socialism and communism were beautiful visions aimed at human equality and happiness and were indeed worthy of pursuit yet in the soviet union china eastern europe and even cambodia various enormous tragedies occurred in the name of building socialist societies and realizing communist ideals an excessive emphasis on revolutionary purity led to endless political purges and rivers of blood an obsession with the dictatorship of the proletariat shackled national development with dogmatism economic policies that ignored real conditions and objective laws caused great famines and bloated industrialization and the promotion of uncompromising class struggle resulted in the slaughter of millions of lives although these tragedies had specific causes such as power struggles and interest conflicts they were also related to the intense pursuit at least in name of the fundamentalist goals within marxist leninist maoist theory after suffering brutal far left disasters and political struggles many chinese russians and eastern europeans later turned to extremely conservative and laissez faire far right paths which was itself a case of extremes reversing caused by earlier far left catastrophes in recent years controversies in western countries surrounding political correctness have also reflected the reality that radicalism and the pursuit of perfection can provoke backlash political correctness is a product of developed societies that have accumulated extensive experience and lessons through various historical sufferings and have evolved into highly civilized societies specific politically correct norms include opposing discrimination against or mockery of ethnic minorities women people with disabilities transgender people and victims of crime or disasters opposing the promotion of hatred and resentment toward particular groups opposing the denial of historical oppression massacres and enslavement of black people and indigenous peoples in u s history and acknowledging scientific conclusions in professional fields such as the reality of climate change and the correctness of evolution these forms of political correctness are necessary both emotionally and rationally and they help protect vulnerable groups reduce hatred promote social harmony and advance science however excessive emphasis on political correctness by some radical leftists and establishment figures has triggered backlash from those who resent it even some people who initially accepted political correctness under incessant emphasis and rigid regulation combined with real life interpersonal conflicts and the darker aspects of human nature gradually came to loathe it deliberately expressing or privately endorsing views opposed to it one reason for donald trump s successful election as u s president was precisely his disregard for political correctness and his freewheeling expression of discriminatory and hateful remarks which resonated with and attracted support from those who detested political correctness in some specific conflict events radicalism and uncompromising thoroughness are also easily met with backlash for example the democracy movement had already achieved significant results and the chinese communist party had made enormous concessions that viewed today are almost unimaginable at that time support for democratization included not only figures such as ccp general secretary zhao ziyang but even deng xiaoping did not strongly oppose democracy deng s political stance was similar to that of j nos k d r of hungary an enlightened pragmatist who wavered between moving toward democracy and maintaining authoritarian rule attempting to find a compromise that would allow partial democracy while preserving ccp dominance where history would head depended on changing circumstances and especially real world power struggles at the time both domestic public opinion with broad support for the democracy movement across sectors and the international environment the peak of the third wave of democratization with both the united states and the soviet union supporting china s democratization and democratic forces across europe asia latin america and africa expressing solidarity were highly favorable to china s democratic forces if the tiananmen square protests had ended peacefully with students and people from all walks of life broadly participating in political activities and civic movements and putting the achieved consensus on political democratization into practice china might well have undergone a democratic transition similar to that of the soviet union and eastern europe later on perhaps even with a better outcome had cooperation between officials and the public been effective however due to the intransigence of a small number of radical actors compromise and withdrawal were not reached in time providing hardliners within the ccp with a pretext deng xiaoping also shifted to support suppression and in the end it was like eggs striking stone china s subsequent historical fate was rewritten from hope to darkness it is worth noting that after the june fourth crackdown occurred a temporary compromise was actually reached through the mediation of liu xiaobo and others among the so called four gentlemen of tiananmen whereby students withdrew in exchange for the cessation of repression from the perspective of protecting life and humanitarianism this is of course beyond reproach and worthy of praise but it also demonstrates the essential weakness of hardline forces and the cowardice behind their high sounding rhetoric on the one hand they were hardline yet they had not thought through what to do if violent repression truly occurred whether they dared to sacrifice themselves and how to make such sacrifice meaningful had there been no compromise after the crackdown and had students workers and citizens confronted repression head on given that many among them had intricate ties with ccp officials at all levels including the highest and especially if some idealistic children of high ranking cadres particularly those from military families had rushed toward tanks and gunfire and been killed or wounded thereby dragging their parents and relatives into the water then after tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of casualties the regime might indeed have hesitated feared softened halted repression or even collapsed or fled abroad even if hardliners had continued repression it might very likely have triggered splits within the ruling group and even mutinies at the very least those whose children relatives or friends died in the repression would not all have been cold blooded and selfish as in the romanian case in that scenario even a sacrifice of lives could arguably have been worth it if it secured democratic success for china freed billions of chinese people then and in the future from shackles restored their rights and dignity and left later generations to remember the courage and merit of those sacrifices as inspiration to strive forward and defend democracy but the actual situation of june fourth was that at the life and death moment when repression had already occurred but not escalated further forces including hardliners and extremists instead became fearful retreated abandoned the idea of using blood to open the people s eyes chose to preserve their strength wait and see or even flee outright rather than press on to create a turning point as a result hundreds to thousands died tens of thousands were imprisoned democratization was aborted and the outcome was left tragically unresolved such fear at the critical moment is of course understandable bullying the weak and fearing the strong is basic human nature and i myself have had similar experiences but objectively speaking this pattern being hardline and rejecting compromise in advance then collapsing at the first real confrontation losing lives and prior gains is the worst possible outcome for a struggle by contrast india s nonviolent noncooperation movement which consistently adhered to peaceful rational nonviolent principles from the outset saw participants face batons and gunfire from british colonial rulers endure brutal beatings and even the killing of comrades without retreating or losing heart and persist relentlessly until victory was achieved of course this was also due to differences in the opponent s level of civilization and the movement s success had multiple causes rather than relying solely on nonviolent noncooperation the hong kong anti extradition bill movement was similar setting aside whether some of its demands were reasonable in terms of methods and outcomes alone large scale peaceful demonstrations had already forced the hong kong government to make concessions and withdraw the extradition bill achieving more concrete results than the earlier occupy central movement and demonstrating to both the hong kong authorities and beijing the will and power of hong kong citizens had matters ended there or had subsequent resistance remained peaceful and sustained victory in parliamentary elections and other political contests would have been entirely possible as confirmed by the results of the hong kong district council elections and greater political space could have been expanded on the basis of such public opinion and mobilization however the anti extradition bill movement gradually evolved into violent acts of smashing looting and arson including indiscriminate attacks on mainland chinese people pro establishment individuals and chinese funded or pro establishment businesses and shops these were not isolated incidents but became quite widespread providing the ccp and the hong kong government with a pretext for repression from the perspective of the ccp and the hong kong authorities it was also impossible to tolerate large scale violence or to compromise and retreat as doing so would undermine authority lead to more violence and for the ccp raise concerns about imitation on the mainland thus repression became the only option and moderate factions within the central and hong kong governments found it difficult to intervene the cornered central authorities and hong kong government decided to quell the situation and take the opportunity to uproot democratic forces consequently the machinery of violence and various public powers were fully mobilized peaceful demonstrations and violent actions alike were suppressed political parties and civic organizations were eradicated and freedom of the press speech and academia were all destroyed hong kong was left with no space for democratic or other anti establishment forces to operate as for claims that even without resistance the xi jinping regime would have destroyed hong kong s democratic and localist forces anyway this could indeed have happened but it was not inevitable even if repression had occurred it likely would not have been as absolute as it is now when one side is in a weaker position it should avoid providing the other with pretexts for attack as much as possible that said whether in the case of the democracy movement or the anti extradition bill movement excessive radicalism and a failure to know when to stop were not the primary causes of failure nor the only causes fundamentally repression by the ruling group was the decisive factor and even if compromise had been made it might not necessarily have been met with compromise in return the ccp could just as well have used compromise especially the termination of the movement and the dispersal of the public as an opportunity to suppress grassroots forces that had already gained momentum and posed a threat to the regime making it easier to defeat them one by one the failure of occupy central can be seen as an example where peaceful assembly and dispersal did not yield optimal results although it had some impact it clearly failed with regard to its two most important demands genuine universal suffrage and dual universal suffrage if the democracy movement had known when to stop it would certainly have achieved some results but it might not have fundamentally altered one party dictatorship limited freedoms and rights could have been reclaimed at any time by conservatives if the people did not resist but instead endured passively dictators who bully the weak and fear the strong might have become even more ruthless as seen over the past three decades despite widespread political apathy and minimal resistance among chinese people the stability maintenance apparatus grew increasingly strong in the later hu wen period and under xi jinping even the semblance of peaceful uneventful lives has been denied to most ordinary people thus the tree may wish to be still but the wind does not stop when democratic forces are strongest morale is highest and mobilization and participation are widest failing to seize the momentum and instead deflating oneself is also unlikely to produce good results had that path been taken the ccp might have made some short term concessions without abandoning authoritarianism and later due to changes in internal and external environments and political struggles conservatives could have gained the upper hand intensified authoritarianism and divided and suppressed the democracy movement the people unable to regroup would have been defeated piecemeal and democracy would remain distant in that case today s histories and commentaries might instead say that the democracy movement failed to press forward and persist to the end compromised and retreated and thus missed a historic opportunity for china s full democratization laying the groundwork for later conservative forces to return to power and reimpose authoritarian oppression during and after the anti extradition bill movement xi jinping steadily intensified authoritarianism and was unlikely to tolerate hong kong a special administrative region under ccp control acting independently and openly criticizing him and the ccp regime thus even without intense resistance hong kong people might have been gradually constrained through boiling the frog slowly style repression ultimately arriving at much the same outcome as today it is hard to imagine that xi jinping and other power holders amid extreme regression on the mainland would tolerate hong kong holding annual political vigils commemorating june fourth or daily public political activities and media discourse openly opposing him and the ccp in sum historical change is influenced by many variables a change in one variable does not necessarily determine whether a particular outcome will or will not occur altering one variable can directly or indirectly alter others and changing a single variable may well lead to outcomes just as bad or even worse than if it had remained unchanged compromise and moderation are necessary but it is also wrong to attribute the failure of movements solely to protesters lack of compromise the pursuit of radicalism and perfection can be maliciously exploited and invite backlash taking historical reform movements the distinction between corruption and political donations the different evils of power and capital animal protection and the evaluation of political figures as examples excessive pursuit of radicalism and perfection can also be exploited by those who obstruct reform throughout history when central governments have introduced policies intended to benefit the people lower level officials fearing damage to their vested interests have often attempted to resist them they dare not openly oppose such policies but instead push their implementation to extremes causing good policies to produce harmful consequences and provoke strong resentment from all sides thereby achieving their goal of blocking or overturning the policies whether in various reform movements of ancient times such as the reforms of wang anshi or the hundred days reform or in the numerous reforms and rectifications of today healthcare reform education reform fiscal and tax reform vested interest groups frequently and deliberately drive policy implementation toward extremes in order to force higher authorities to retreat or even abolish the policies of course some extreme measures are not driven by this motive for example shandong s hundred days without births beijing s expulsion of the so called low end population and the recent high intensity covid controls these were not cases of lower levels intentionally pushing extremes to compel upper levels to halt policies but rather of deliberately exerting force upward to curry favor with superiors discipline the populace and display official authority in order to gain benefits overemphasis on perfection also blurs differences in the degree of good and bad and in the scale of gains and losses it treats systems policies ideas and events that are all imperfect but differ markedly in degree as well as individuals or groups that all have flaws but where some are clearly flawed warriors and others merely flies as uniformly bad or evil asserting that all crows are black for example it equates regulated and supervised political donations under democratic systems with corruption under authoritarian rule it draws an equivalence between the relative economic tightness of ordinary people in developed countries and the struggle of chinese citizens for basic food clothing housing and transportation and it compares limited speech restrictions in rule of law and free societies with the tight comprehensive censorship of totalitarian systems such positions may appear to reflect moral rigor and intolerance of evil though some are deliberately malicious but they inevitably lead to the situation described by the saying when water is too pure there are no fish when people are too exacting they have no companions they weaken enthusiasm and support for the relatively better side allow those who are relatively worse more evil and more harmful to evade the proportionally greater condemnation and punishment they deserve obstruct limited but valuable progress and deprive further reform efforts of their foundation and stepping stones this is similar to how people in china often denounce the evils of capital and capitalists while rarely mentioning the fact that capital is relatively gentler than power and capitalists relatively less brutal than bureaucrats thereby causing the more dangerous evil of power to be ignored or downplayed likewise those who criticize the many problems of the reform and opening up era often obscure the far darker and more desperate historical reality of the mao era opponents of animal protection often criticize animal welfare advocates for loving cats and dogs but not chickens ducks fish pigs or cattle and if they claim to care about those critics then ask why they do not also protect rats flies mosquitoes or even bacteria and viruses in this way they deconstruct the value and necessity of protecting some animals deliberately using rigid and partial logic rather than a complete and systematic rationale to negate the compromises that animal protectors make based on reality beyond evaluating events when judging historical figures it is likewise inappropriate to criticize as equivalent those who all committed wrongs or crimes but whose degrees of culpability differ markedly figures such as chiang kai shek deng xiaoping and park chung hee while authoritarian and responsible for the killing of innocents also achieved certain economic and social accomplishments if they are lumped together with figures such as adolf hitler mao zedong and kim il sung whose crimes were extreme and all are labeled simply as cruel dictators this may not be entirely indefensible but it objectively downplays the evils of the latter group and erases the contributions of the former in certain domains such an approach which fails to distinguish degrees of right and wrong depth and severity is clearly unfavorable to an objective and comprehensive reflection of complex historical realities and to accurate judgment and appropriate differentiation in dealing with historical figures furthermore under the effect of extremes reversing when perfectionist goals fail former adherents are likely to lose confidence entirely and become cynical or withdraw from society unwilling even to participate in incremental reform thereby pushing reality even farther from ideals this is similar to how the failure of extreme communist policies led many people in those countries to develop a generalized aversion to all left wing and progressive ideas the tragedies of the cultural revolution and june fourth also lie in this post failure conservatization after the failures of the cultural revolution and the student movement and the democracy movement chinese intellectuals and indeed large segments of the public who had once been passionate about politics largely chose to withdraw becoming refined egoists the popularity since the s of ideas such as farewell to revolution and getting rich quietly is precisely the product of failed radical demands and the collapse of corresponding political ideals these outcomes are exactly what reform blockers and major wrongdoers hope to see and actively promote extremism and the pursuit of perfection often come at the expense of others groups goals or values taking the development of heavy industry in socialist states the dynamic zero covid policy wikileaks disclosure of state secrets radical anti japanese sentiment in early twentieth century china and the failures of the two ancient emperors wang mang and yang guang as examples extremism and thoroughness may appear perfect but they are only perfect or victorious for certain specific goals or groups for society as a whole and for broader more diverse populations they instead represent harm and failure and they often rebound against the very goals they seek to achieve at all costs this is because pursuing the perfection of one goal or insisting on the full realization of certain groups interests almost inevitably comes at the expense of other goals and by encroaching upon others interests for example when countries such as the soviet union china and north korea concentrated their resources on developing heavy industry they consumed resources needed by other sectors hindered the normal development of light industry and services and turned peasants into blood donors and sacrificial victims this led to distorted economic structures and an inability to meet citizens everyday needs for light industrial goods agricultural products and services becoming an important cause of eventual economic collapse and systemic sclerosis since the founding of the people s republic various departments and localities have pursued showcase projects and enforced one size fits all policies for the sake of political performance or to curry favor with leaders while achieving certain objectives these actions have inflicted even greater harm on people s livelihoods similarly in recent years china s dynamic zero covid policy centered on high intensity lockdowns and quarantines did indeed curb the spread of the virus but it severely infringed on personal freedoms damaged economic development and caused tangible and intangible losses far exceeding the harm caused by covid itself the actions of extreme information libertarians such as edward snowden chelsea manning and julian assange publicly disclosing nearly all secrets they knew and advocating complete transparency of governments and politics have undoubtedly helped expose the dark sides of u s and global politics and the infringement of citizens privacy through the combination of state power and big data yet extreme information libertarianism inevitably undermines counterterrorism and national security damages international political operations and diplomatic relations produces various negative effects and in turn becomes a pretext for restricting information freedom in china after the xinhai revolution the movements of national salvation and enlightenment surged people broadly regarded resisting foreign invasion and colonialism externally and pursuing democracy and prosperity internally as firm and non negotiable goals in principle this was of course correct however excessive nationalist tendencies such as blind boycotts of foreign goods harassment of foreigners in china though many actions were self defense and the adoption of extremely exclusionary slogans led to the deterioration of relations between china and the great powers especially japan facing a neighboring and powerful japan chinese citizens adopted radical anti japanese attitudes and pressured the nationalist government to take a hard line china s radical nationalism from a position of weakness stimulated even more extreme japanese nationalism and militarism pushing the two nations into confrontation and making peaceful coexistence impossible accelerating japan s invasion of china as a result china s democratic development and economic and social progress were destroyed by the war of resistance against japan and its aftermath of course the fundamental fault and crimes lay with japan yet had there been room for compromise had the chinese people chosen to bide their time and build strength rather than loudly opposing imperialism and japan emphasized self strengthening over excessive rigidity from a position of weakness china might have avoided a series of subsequent disasters history might have taken a different course and sino japanese relations would not have become as profoundly distorted as they are today if one looks only at sino japanese official and popular relations and interactions before the september incident and even the august incident japan actually rendered considerable assistance to china especially to the han chinese such as promoting the anti qing national democratic revolution and serving as an intermediary for the transmission of western modern civilization after japan s invasion of china especially the nanjing massacre however everything became irreparable even after diplomatic normalization the relationship remained profoundly unhealthy and distorted japan s support for the ccp s dictatorship further destroyed any genuine friendship between china and japan a tragedy for both countries and especially for china the boycotts of japanese goods and expulsions of japanese nationals from to did not make china stronger or more prosperous instead they intensified sino japanese antagonism by contrast after reform and opening up china s comprehensive importation of japanese goods and invitation for japanese nationals to work and live in china effectively declared the failure and futility of the struggles a century earlier losing both dignity and practical benefit conversely had china followed a path more like south korea s focusing first on self strengthening rather than boycotts and only after strengthening itself pursuing autonomy and rooted development it might have truly developed its national economy and safeguarded the interests of its people history also offers many examples of feudal rulers driven by grandiose ambitions who spared no cost to pursue certain goals such as wang mang who forcibly implemented comprehensive political and social reforms and yang guang who was obsessed with massive construction projects and foreign campaigns some of their goals may have been well intentioned and even had positive significance but by disregarding real constraints and paying any

> NEW YEAR'S GREETINGS 2026. BE OF GOOD CHEER!
> 
> We can no longer afford the rich.

> We can bring about the end of the imperial way of life.

> We can stop the overexploitation of the earth.

> In the greed for energy, the earth is being depleted, sucked dry, burned, ravaged, burned down, raped, destroyed. Entire regions are being made uninhabitable by the heat. They are simply burning up. Or habitats are disappearing under the floods or due to rising sea levels.

> Shutting down fossil fuel power plants is manual labor. Take courage.

> We know we must stop this destruction. We know we are not alone. Do not give up hope for a world where life has a place, not greed for money, power, and destruction.

>Last night, we successfully sabotaged the gas-fired power plant in Berlin-Lichterfelde. This caused power outages in the wealthier districts of Wannsee, Zehlendorf, and Nikolassee. Power outages were not the goal of the action, but rather the fossil fuel industry. We apologize to the less affluent residents of southwest Berlin. However, our sympathy for the many villa owners in these neighborhoods is limited. We explain why in our article below.

>Our action, which is oriented toward the common good, is socially meaningful. We have also commented on this in more detail in our letter regarding the action.
The attack on the gas-fired power plant is an act of self-defense and international solidarity with all those who protect the earth and life. The infrastructures that serve the “technological attack” and promote the destruction of the earth can be sabotaged. Fossil fuel energy production can be stopped. Smart city metropolises, such as Berlin is supposed to become, can be prevented. With Stromnetz Berlin, a building block of this catastrophic vision of a smart city has been hit.

>For us, it goes without saying that we have ruled out any danger to human life at all times.
Our detailed explanation is attached to this information.

>NEW YEAR'S GREETINGS 2026. BE OF GOOD CHEER!

>Greed for power, greed for energy, greed for destruction
In the greed for energy, the earth is being depleted, sucked dry, burned, ravaged, burned down, raped, destroyed. Entire regions are being made uninhabitable by the heat. They are simply burning up. Or habitats are disappearing under the floods or due to rising sea levels. Several thousand residents of Tuvalu in the Pacific are already seeking refuge in Australia.

>Last year, the CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere rose to 423.9 parts per million, a value that surpasses all previous records. At the same time, climate researchers agree that the huge transatlantic ocean currents will eventually break down due to global warming. This collapse of the ocean currents, which has given the north a mild climate until now, is only part of the catastrophe that awaits us. The extent of this devastation is simply ignored, abstracted, and discussed at global climate conferences until the extent of the destruction has disappeared into tables and declarations of intent.
But the hunger for energy is insatiable and is eating its way through the Earth's crust and our lives, among other things, to feed artificial intelligence, which then spews out stereotypes and nonsense and confuses, disorients, and/or manipulates us. Meanwhile, language, expression, and liveliness are increasingly reduced, mutilated, and limited with each new “learning” of AI based on previous data.

>We feed our data into the “clouds,” which are nothing more than gigantic, energy-guzzling computing and server centers. They also drink our drinking water and excrete numbers that bombard us with useless, supposedly important spam on our screens until we have forgotten how to look our neighbors in the eye. Having become dependent on these small devices, we are always ready to send an emoji and feed “big brother,” whose algorithm registers our deviations from the norm and answers our search queries before we have even finished thinking. We sit together with our friends while the feeds consume us, and we sink into our devices instead of talking to each other in real life. We are serving our own surveillance, and it is total. The tech companies are in the hands of men of power, which we give them. We devour the colorful images that the machines filter for us and starve in front of our screens from loneliness and alienation. 

>We are becoming mindless zombies who run each other over in traffic. We are prisoners in a digital system that increasingly deprives us of our right to exist if we do not submit to the rules of the game and move our lives to social media, chat rooms, and artificial realities. We don't get any money, we can't book or buy anything in cash. Without access to the digital world, we are increasingly excluded, losing touch with what seems normal. We are afraid of what is happening to us and bury ourselves even deeper into our screens instead of turning off our devices and taking away the power of those who track, pursue, observe, and manipulate us. We blind ourselves to the knowledge that Edward Snowden risked his life to spread. We turn a deaf ear to the silent cries of indigenous peoples and farmers who see the planet's lifeline burning before their eyes. On the contrary, with every post we feed the fire that surrounds us and causes temperatures to rise to new record highs every year. One day, we will simply sit in front of glowing screens or dead devices and die of thirst and hunger. It is no longer difficult to imagine this.

>We're not saying we know the way out. But we know we have to stop this destruction. Hedonism can no longer ensnare us once we've smelled the cold sweat that spreads when there is no way out. No more forward and no more backward. Only the horror of where we as humanity have ended up. When the question comes back to us, what did you actually do to prevent what is coming? You saw it coming, the survivors, the next generations, will ask us. Please don't come to us with the parties. Please don't come to us with the brown alternatives in pinstripe suits and costumes. And not with the Greens or the Left either. Don't give us the economy, whose free market will solve the problem. Business and politics deal with death every day. With dictatorships and butchers. Concerns are virtually non-existent when it comes to satisfying the hunger for energy, for example. Russia is still supplying gas to Europe via Nord Stream 1. And the U.S. wants Venezuela's oil. That's why military attacks are now taking place. And fracking gas is being shipped in from all over the world. Currently, 79% of it comes from the US! Fracking is extremely harmful to the environment. Even during extraction, methane losses of 6 to 10 percent are assumed, which further heats up the atmosphere.

>95% of the gas burned in Germany is imported. Climate summits only produce tactical lip service because oil-producing countries are not interested in climate protection, but in money. Because metropolitan countries base their policies on money and growth, lobbyists in Europe are currently being given a free pass on the phase-out of combustion engines.

>German Minister of Economics Katharina Reiche, for example, was State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Transport, lobbyist for the Association of Municipal Companies (VKM), and manager at E.ON subsidiary Westenergie. E.ON Minister Reiche presents herself as a supporter of hydrogen, but is primarily focused on natural gas. She wants to issue tenders for additional gas-fired power plants with a capacity of 10 gigawatts, which are to be connected to the grid by 2031, corresponding to approximately 25 new power plants. 20 billion euros have been earmarked for these new gas-fired power plants.

>Reiche would prefer to postpone Germany's climate neutrality from 2045 to 2050 anyway.

>The main perpetrators of human-induced climate destruction are not those who suffer most from it, who pay for it with their health and their lives. The people of the Global South are already paying the highest price. The countries of the Global North, and soon China among others, are deciding the fate of everyone. China, as a communist, racist, and patriarchal dictatorship, can use “rare earths” to blackmail countries that do not toe the line, gradually weaving countries, cultures, and political systems into the cocoon of the new dictatorial world power. Over 85% of the world's refined “rare earths” come from China. And it is the rich who are the problem. It is the super-rich who are setting the world on fire. In the East, in the West, in the South and in the North. 60 percent of the investments made by the super-rich worldwide go into gas and oil. And around 300 super-rich individuals emit more CO² than the 110 poorest countries in the world. These criminals know this. They don't care. Their greed for even more wealth and power sets the standard that everyone follows. They are preparing their own “rescue” on isolated islands or in space once they have burned up this earth. A few years ago, we would have laughed at these misogynistic crackpots, but they are deadly serious. Zuckerberg wants more “masculine energy.” Musk “produces” children on an assembly line so that his clan will survive.

>None of the perpetrators are solving the “problem.” And the fundamental problem is certainly not being solved at the regional level. On the contrary, the whole world is arming itself for the final battle for raw materials, water, food, and access to strategically important regions in order to prevent or at least delay the demise of their own spheres of influence. So that the population can be offered the chance to participate for as long as possible. So that we in the global North, cocooned in a world of consumption and an imperial lifestyle, can participate and confirm the power of their increasingly authoritarian concepts. Because it is no longer about freedom for all, it is only about security for some. The promise of security is an exclusive right of those who can enforce it for themselves. We make the losers pay for our imperial lifestyle, those who are too weak to defend themselves against “us.”

>We reject the offers of participation in a burned-out world with our militant action. That is why we carried out the action at the gas-fired power plant in Lichterfelde.

>This does not prevent us from becoming entangled in an imperial way of life at the expense of other life, but it does send a signal. Once again, as many people and groups in different parts of the world are doing. As some groups here, such as volcano groups, have been doing consistently since 2011.

>We know that these words do not reach many people—they are so far removed from the idea of a world and a coexistence that is not based on destruction that these words reach them as little as the misery of the world that is transported daily in high resolution on our screens. We can list facts for miles and miles and still not be heard.

>We are not the first and we will not be the last to try to reach people with words anyway. We are not the first and last to resort to sabotage, because we are playing for time. At the same time, we and others are using the time we have gained to reverse the destruction of all life forms. People call us eco-terrorists, but we respect life. People call us irresponsible, but we are taking responsibility to end this imperial, destructive way of life.

>Our public welfare-oriented campaign is socially meaningful. We are trying to stop the exploitation of the earth, prevent CO₂ deaths, and halt the diseases associated with the climate catastrophe. We are also trying to put an end to species extinction and make the world a better place to live for everyone. Those who call us “eco-terrorists” are themselves the true eco-terrorists, expressing this in terms of selfish interests and power calculations.

>We see the unconscious who think they are smart and consider climate change to be fake news. They consider empathy to be woke and only have their own interests in mind, without recognizing how the things around them are interconnected. Behind this spreading rejection of facts, we see a system of those who invest in the destruction of the Earth. They are the same people who hold power over the tech companies, which allows them to breed a species of humans who applaud when people drown, die of thirst, starve, or otherwise perish in their attempt to reach Europe or the US. These manipulated prosperity chauvinists and party supporters second Trump, Modi, Miley, Netanyahu, Merz, Weidel, Putin, Höcke, Orban, Vans, Xi, and whatever else they are called, in their “defense” of freedom. The freedom to decide who must die and who must not. Who gets access to wealth and who does not. Yet every refugee who dies while fleeing has their counterpart here in a deep depression. Every person who starves makes us fatter and sicker.
We, the people of the global North, of the rich metropolises, derive no benefit from the misery of others. Material wealth is not wealth in the sense of an idea that can be enjoyed by everyone.

>If only a small portion of the population in every country would say, “Enough is enough. Not with us, not in my name. No one should die at our expense.” If we refuse to function and play along, if we become sand in the gears of a machine that we ourselves have been feeding, then something will start to happen, then we can develop the power to stop the causes once and for all.

>But we need an international movement to reject progress that is based solely on destruction, murder, and robbery. We call out desperately, angrily, and resolutely, joining the calls of others: Sabotage the fossil fuel infrastructure, the power grids, the exploitation of the earth, the server centers, the chip industry and its suppliers, destroy the foundations of the automotive and arms industries, of air travel, of mansions, yachts, spaceships, and golf courses. Destroy the police headquarters that guarantee patriarchal property relations, because the earth belongs to itself and to all living beings, not to humans, or rather to men alone, and not to the richest among them. This cry of despair is also a wake-up call, a cry of hope, and it has no local boundaries; it is global. We are talking about an international movement that does not refer to a patriarch, not to the gallery of heads that communists worship, but one that starts from different premises. One that is understood in China, in Europe, in the USA, in India and Pakistan, in every corner of the earth where Starlink has reception, in every country where the deadly drone seeks its target and needs electricity to do so. In every country where, without energy, the warring forces are blind and people can leave the battlefields without anyone being able to issue orders to kill them. Where the stock markets no longer function and bitcoins can no longer be accessed.

>We say it again, we have ideas but no definitive answers about the path. But we do have answers about the goal. Every contribution counts. But trying everything within our power to put an end to this imperial way of life cannot be wrong. The progress of destruction is man-made, and we can also stop it. In the steps of resistance, in the echoes of different languages and cultures, in what others send out to us, we will find and recognize ourselves. It's about the Earth. It's about life. It's against immature, stupid men at the levers of power who act as if they were operating a toy excavator.

>There is no time for frustration about resistance to man-made climate change and the growing number of deniers of this change. We must learn from our defeats, not by joining parties or privatizing or settling into collapse, but by establishing facts. Shutting down a gas-fired power plant is one such fact, but it can also be occupying land, squares, and forests, or destroying the golf courses and airports of the rich. Imagination and determination are required.

>Switch off the greed for energy, switch off the digital management of life, switch off the progress of destruction.

>Today we attacked the gas and steam turbine cogeneration plant in Lichterfelde. The power plant produces a total electrical output of 300 MW using natural gas. The target was the high-voltage power lines in order to cause significant damage to the company. We set fire to the cable bridge, which is not publicly listed and runs from the Lichterfelde power plant across the Teltow Canal, on the side of the green space. We also short-circuited the scorched cable strands with steel rods lying around.

>Das Energieunternehmen wird auf dem freien Markt Strom in Echtzeit kaufen müssen, um die Vertragsverpflichtungen zu erfüllen, die sie mit der Auslieferung des Stroms eingegangen sind, sobald der Ausfall der Lieferung bemerkt wird. Wir gehen nicht davon aus, dass wir dadurch 100.000 Haushalte vom Netz abgetrennt haben, sondern dass wir diese nur vom Netz des Gaskraftwerks abgetrennt haben. Das mehrfach gesicherte Energienetz wird über andere Wege der Energieleitungen die Haushalte in kürzester Zeit wieder über das weit verzweigte Stromnetz anschließen. Der kurzfristige Kauf von Energie zu den marktüblichen Preisen ist möglicherweise teurer als zu dem Zeitpunkt, als das Energieunternehmen den Strom an der Leipziger Strombörse (EEX) gekauft hat. Um nicht hohe Vertragsstrafen an die einzelnen Energieabnehmer zu zahlen bleibt ihnen kein anderer Weg. Wir haben über zwanzig 110 KV Leitungen kurzgeschlossen und die Fernwärmerohre nicht in den Anschlag einbezogen. Aber wir können Auswirkungen auf die Fernwärme nicht ausschließen.

>Our action differs in practical terms from the action in Adlershof on September 9, 2025, against the technology center. That involved a supply line that neglected redundant protection. The situation was similar with the “Vulkangruppe Tesla ausschalten” (Shut down Tesla volcano group), which took Tesla off the grid by destroying a supply line, affecting around 5,000 private households. In our case, the power will not be cut off in front of a facility such as the technology park or the Gigafactory, causing a blackout at that facility, but rather the power plant with its extensive network of cables will be disconnected from the power grid. It will still produce electricity, but will no longer be able to feed it into the grid and thus will no longer be able to supply it. However, the ability to supply private households via other power plants remains intact, which is also the intention of the authorities and energy giants. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that our action will have a greater impact on individual transformer stations.

>We have not interrupted the supply of district heating (thermal output around 690 MW).

> Individual households are not the target of this action. The aim of the action is to cause significant damage to the gas industry and the greed for energy.
If there are prolonged outages in private households, we want to make it clear that they are not the target of the attack. This effect was neither intended nor calculated by us. We have ruled out any danger to human life at all times.

>Since we cannot be 100% certain what chain reactions, beyond our control, our shutdown of the gasworks might cause, we have the following request for any households that may be affected: Ring your neighbors' doorbells. Please consider helping elderly or vulnerable people in the event of a power failure. Support yourself and others by offering solidarity and assistance. Keep each other informed.

>The combined heat and power plant in Lichterfelde was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swedish state-owned energy company Vattenfall AB, with annual sales of €7.6 billion and the fourth-largest electricity company after E.ON, RWE, and EnBW.

>In 2021, the power plant was “re-municipalized” and now belongs to the city of Berlin. As a result, the power plant is being partially dismantled and converted to accommodate additional capacity. This only sounds good at first glance.

>Stromnetz Berlin GmbH is currently making extensive investments in the expansion of Berlin's grid infrastructure in order to meet the growing demands of the so-called energy transition. To this end, Stromnetz Berlin's subsidiary BEN (Berliner Energie und Netzholding GmbH) is receiving €380 million from the European Investment Bank – “to prepare for the ongoing energy transition.” The “energy transition” is a smokescreen that obscures the fact that it is all about energy without transition and without ifs and buts. The main thing is energy, sustainable or not. Stromnetz Berlin wants to double its capacity by the beginning of 2030. The goal is a “modern” digitized power grid. In concrete terms, this means hundreds of thousands of meters of new power cables and grid components, as well as more digital services. We can guess that this is not being done out of charity. Ostensibly, it is about the city's security of supply, but on closer inspection, it is about a growth mania in a competition forced by the government. The battlefield is the city and our living conditions. The city is a commodity. Competitiveness with other major cities is intended to encourage more start-ups to settle there, more companies researching and producing armaments, more digital service providers and tech companies that consume even more electricity than the millions of Berliners use privately. It is also about e-mobility, which of course does not aim to promote public transport, but rather to put even more metal rolling through the streets powered by lithium batteries, and even more AI-dominated systems spewing out self-driving private vehicles. This is then classified as “infrastructure expansion,” which will cost the state another €3 billion by 2029, after the A100 motorway has eaten its way deeper and deeper into the city. Investments of up to €770 million will be made to renew the power grid.

>This all sounds rather tedious, but it is of great importance to us as residents of Berlin and Brandenburg, because it is our lives, our land, our water, and our future that are being negotiated here. For Giffey, the economic liberal of the SPD, the expansion of grid capacities and new power lines is a central prerequisite for Berlin as an investment location. These economic liberals, destroyers of a livable future, think of the city in terms of numbers, sums of money, growth rates, and competition with other cities. People don't count, or only as low-income or high-income variables. The former must be managed and restricted in some way—including through police and repressive measures, such as walling off a park in Kreuzberg. The latter are flattered, because their money stimulates consumption. For this group, the city is made smart and pretty. Berlin is a brand and is treated as such.

>For Giffay, the expansion of the power grid corresponds to the rapid digitization of everyday life, as if it were a force of nature descending upon us. As if it were not the tech corporations and tech fascists who are deciding on the implementation of AI, which, according to the Federal Ministry of Economics, will double global electricity consumption by 2030. It is not politicians and economic liberals who decide that cash payments will no longer be accepted on BVG buses, forcing people to use digital payments, which also ensures that they can be tracked, in a rebellious city with a tradition of militant movements that need to be controlled. When politicians decide to give the police and secret services access to Palantir surveillance software, whose driving force is a fascist from the US and whose software provides a digital network for monitoring people. Giffay promotes the expansion of the grid with “our” companies and the increasing electrification of mobility: “For the love of Berlin, the most modern power grid for the climate-neutral capital.” And, skilled at defusing criticism, Stromnetz Berlin has included “citizens' councils” as fig leaves, which can exercise ridiculous participation in trivialities but have no say in the direction of energy policy decisions and the design of the city. After Vattenfall and the city were forced by a broad citizens' initiative to initiate a “re-municipalization,” a nationalization of the power grid, and to appoint BEN as the owner, they are continuing business as usual and the madness continues unabated. The vision is clear: Smart City – Stromnetz Berlin says it all: “Berlin is on its way to becoming one of the leading smart city metropolises. This transformation process has already begun in all areas of urban life.” And: “Intelligent infrastructures, and especially the ‘smart grid’ (intelligent power grid), will form the foundation – as a networked operating system, it will become the backbone and catalyst of the energy transition.” Apart from the fact that we consider the term “energy transition” to be window dressing and would replace it with “technological attack on human conditions,” we agree.

>The specific attacks on the Adlershof Technology Park, Tesla's Gigafactory, the infrastructure of Vattenfall's Reuter coal-fired power plant, and Vodafone's hub in Adlershof are reference points for our action, as are the many militant actions that highlight the destruction of our planet. Even if these acts of sabotage cause high financial losses, they cannot force a change in political direction as individual (!) actions. But they point the way and direction that we recommend to all metropolises. Paralyze the infrastructures that serve the “technological attack” and promote the destruction of the earth. The consensus on participation in the project of an imperial way of life can be revoked. A mass social movement against the global destruction of the foundations of life and against all wars and resource plundering goes hand in hand with the ability to sabotage power grids and energy arteries.

>The attack on the gas power plant is an act of international solidarity with all those who protect the earth and life. Our resistance is diverse, and often, in the fog of disinformation, different cultural approaches, and linguistic differences, we still need too much time to recognize our commonalities. But we are confident that in the darkness, the light is not far away. When we place this action in the context of global resistance, whether in the US, Latin America, Asia, China, Russia, Europe, or Australia, against all manifestations of domination, rule, and destruction of the earth, we are confident that we will be heard, that these contributions will be translated, that translated contributions will reach us, that subversive communication will take place on the winding paths of resistance, recognizing each other. And intervening. And doing so without bloodshed, if possible, but determined to cut off the rulers' lifeline.

Power outages were not the goal of the action, but rather the fossil fuel industry. We apologize to the less affluent residents of southwest Berlin. However, our sympathy for the many villa owners in these neighborhoods is limited. We explain why in our article below.

>Our action, which is oriented toward the common good, is socially meaningful. We have also commented on this in more detail in our letter regarding the action.
The attack on the gas-fired power plant is an act of self-defense and international solidarity with all those who protect the earth and life. The infrastructures that serve the “technological attack” and promote the destruction of the earth can be sabotaged. Fossil fuel energy production can be stopped. Smart city metropolises, such as Berlin is supposed to become, can be prevented. With Stromnetz Berlin, a building block of this catastrophic vision of a smart city has been hit.

>For us, it goes without saying that we have ruled out any danger to human life at all times.
Our detailed explanation is attached to this information.

>NEW YEAR'S GREETINGS 2026. BE OF GOOD CHEER!

>Greed for power, greed for energy, greed for destruction
In the greed for energy, the earth is being depleted, sucked dry, burned, ravaged, burned down, raped, destroyed. Entire regions are being made uninhabitable by the heat. They are simply burning up. Or habitats are disappearing under the floods or due to rising sea levels. Several thousand residents of Tuvalu in the Pacific are already seeking refuge in Australia.

>Last year, the CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere rose to 423.9 parts per million, a value that surpasses all previous records. At the same time, climate researchers agree that the huge transatlantic ocean currents will eventually break down due to global warming. This collapse of the ocean currents, which has given the north a mild climate until now, is only part of the catastrophe that awaits us. The extent of this devastation is simply ignored, abstracted, and discussed at global climate conferences until the extent of the destruction has disappeared into tables and declarations of intent.
But the hunger for energy is insatiable and is eating its way through the Earth's crust and our lives, among other things, to feed artificial intelligence, which then spews out stereotypes and nonsense and confuses, disorients, and/or manipulates us. Meanwhile, language, expression, and liveliness are increasingly reduced, mutilated, and limited with each new “learning” of AI based on previous data.

>We feed our data into the “clouds,” which are nothing more than gigantic, energy-guzzling computing and server centers. They also drink our drinking water and excrete numbers that bombard us with useless, supposedly important spam on our screens until we have forgotten how to look our neighbors in the eye. Having become dependent on these small devices, we are always ready to send an emoji and feed “big brother,” whose algorithm registers our deviations from the norm and answers our search queries before we have even finished thinking. We sit together with our friends while the feeds consume us, and we sink into our devices instead of talking to each other in real life. We are serving our own surveillance, and it is total. The tech companies are in the hands of men of power, which we give them. We devour the colorful images that the machines filter for us and starve in front of our screens from loneliness and alienation. 

>We are becoming mindless zombies who run each other over in traffic. We are prisoners in a digital system that increasingly deprives us of our right to exist if we do not submit to the rules of the game and move our lives to social media, chat rooms, and artificial realities. We don't get any money, we can't book or buy anything in cash. Without access to the digital world, we are increasingly excluded, losing touch with what seems normal. We are afraid of what is happening to us and bury ourselves even deeper into our screens instead of turning off our devices and taking away the power of those who track, pursue, observe, and manipulate us. We blind ourselves to the knowledge that Edward Snowden risked his life to spread. We turn a deaf ear to the silent cries of indigenous peoples and farmers who see the planet's lifeline burning before their eyes. On the contrary, with every post we feed the fire that surrounds us and causes temperatures to rise to new record highs every year. One day, we will simply sit in front of glowing screens or dead devices and die of thirst and hunger. It is no longer difficult to imagine this.

>We're not saying we know the way out. But we know we have to stop this destruction. Hedonism can no longer ensnare us once we've smelled the cold sweat that spreads when there is no way out.

No one should die at our expense.” If we refuse to function and play along, if we become sand in the gears of a machine that we ourselves have been feeding, then something will start to happen, then we can develop the power to stop the causes once and for all.

>But we need an international movement to reject progress that is based solely on destruction, murder, and robbery. We call out desperately, angrily, and resolutely, joining the calls of others: Sabotage the fossil fuel infrastructure, the power grids, the exploitation of the earth, the server centers, the chip industry and its suppliers, destroy the foundations of the automotive and arms industries, of air travel, of mansions, yachts, spaceships, and golf courses. Destroy the police headquarters that guarantee patriarchal property relations, because the earth belongs to itself and to all living beings, not to humans, or rather to men alone, and not to the richest among them. This cry of despair is also a wake-up call, a cry of hope, and it has no local boundaries; it is global. We are talking about an international movement that does not refer to a patriarch, not to the gallery of heads that communists worship, but one that starts from different premises. One that is understood in China, in Europe, in the USA, in India and Pakistan, in every corner of the earth where Starlink has reception, in every country where the deadly drone seeks its target and needs electricity to do so. In every country where, without energy, the warring forces are blind and people can leave the battlefields without anyone being able to issue orders to kill them. Where the stock markets no longer function and bitcoins can no longer be accessed.

>We say it again, we have ideas but no definitive answers about the path. But we do have answers about the goal. Every contribution counts. But trying everything within our power to put an end to this imperial way of life cannot be wrong. The progress of destruction is man-made, and we can also stop it. In the steps of resistance, in the echoes of different languages and cultures, in what others send out to us, we will find and recognize ourselves. It's about the Earth. It's about life. It's against immature, stupid men at the levers of power who act as if they were operating a toy excavator.

>There is no time for frustration about resistance to man-made climate change and the growing number of deniers of this change. We must learn from our defeats, not by joining parties or privatizing or settling into collapse, but by establishing facts. Shutting down a gas-fired power plant is one such fact, but it can also be occupying land, squares, and forests, or destroying the golf courses and airports of the rich. Imagination and determination are required.

>Switch off the greed for energy, switch off the digital management of life, switch off the progress of destruction.

>Today we attacked the gas and steam turbine cogeneration plant in Lichterfelde. The power plant produces a total electrical output of 300 MW using natural gas. The target was the high-voltage power lines in order to cause significant damage to the company. We set fire to the cable bridge, which is not publicly listed and runs from the Lichterfelde power plant across the Teltow Canal, on the side of the green space. We also short-circuited the scorched cable strands with steel rods lying around.

>Das Energieunternehmen wird auf dem freien Markt Strom in Echtzeit kaufen müssen, um die Vertragsverpflichtungen zu erfüllen, die sie mit der Auslieferung des Stroms eingegangen sind, sobald der Ausfall der Lieferung bemerkt wird. Wir gehen nicht davon aus, dass wir dadurch 100.000 Haushalte vom Netz abgetrennt haben, sondern dass wir diese nur vom Netz des Gaskraftwerks abgetrennt haben. Das mehrfach gesicherte Energienetz wird über andere Wege der Energieleitungen die Haushalte in kürzester Zeit wieder über das weit verzweigte Stromnetz anschließen. Der kurzfristige Kauf von Energie zu den marktüblichen Preisen ist möglicherweise teurer als zu dem Zeitpunkt, als das Energieunternehmen den Strom an der Leipziger Strombörse (EEX) gekauft hat. Um nicht hohe Vertragsstrafen an die einzelnen Energieabnehmer zu zahlen bleibt ihnen kein anderer Weg. Wir haben über zwanzig 110 KV Leitungen kurzgeschlossen und die Fernwärmerohre nicht in den Anschlag einbezogen. Aber wir können Auswirkungen auf die Fernwärme nicht ausschließen.

>Our action differs in practical terms from the action in Adlershof on September 9, 2025, against the technology center. That involved a supply line that neglected redundant protection. The situation was similar with the “Vulkangruppe Tesla ausschalten” (Shut down Tesla volcano group), which took Tesla off the grid by destroying a supply line, affecting around 5,000 private households. In our case, the power will not be cut off in front of a facility such as the technology park or the Gigafactory, causing a blackout at that facility, but rather the power plant with its extensive network of cables will be disconnected from the power grid. It will still produce electricity, but will no longer be able to feed it into the grid and thus will no longer be able to supply it. However, the ability to supply private households via other power plants remains intact, which is also the intention of the authorities and energy giants. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that our action will have a greater impact on individual transformer stations.

>We have not interrupted the supply of district heating (thermal output around 690 MW).

> Individual households are not the target of this action. The aim of the action is to cause significant damage to the gas industry and the greed for energy.
If there are prolonged outages in private households, we want to make it clear that they are not the target of the attack. This effect was neither intended nor calculated by us. We have ruled out any danger to human life at all times.

>Since we cannot be 100% certain what chain reactions, beyond our control, our shutdown of the gasworks might cause, we have the following request for any households that may be affected: Ring your neighbors' doorbells. Please consider helping elderly or vulnerable people in the event of a power failure. Support yourself and others by offering solidarity and assistance. Keep each other informed.

>The combined heat and power plant in Lichterfelde was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swedish state-owned energy company Vattenfall AB, with annual sales of €7.6 billion and the fourth-largest electricity company after E.ON, RWE, and EnBW.

>In 2021, the power plant was “re-municipalized” and now belongs to the city of Berlin. As a result, the power plant is being partially dismantled and converted to accommodate additional capacity. This only sounds good at first glance.

>Stromnetz Berlin GmbH is currently making extensive investments in the expansion of Berlin's grid infrastructure in order to meet the growing demands of the so-called energy transition. To this end, Stromnetz Berlin's subsidiary BEN (Berliner Energie und Netzholding GmbH) is receiving €380 million from the European Investment Bank – “to prepare for the ongoing energy transition.” The “energy transition” is a smokescreen that obscures the fact that it is all about energy without transition and without ifs and buts. The main thing is energy, sustainable or not. Stromnetz Berlin wants to double its capacity by the beginning of 2030. The goal is a “modern” digitized power grid. In concrete terms, this means hundreds of thousands of meters of new power cables and grid components, as well as more digital services. We can guess that this is not being done out of charity. Ostensibly, it is about the city's security of supply, but on closer inspection, it is about a growth mania in a competition forced by the government. The battlefield is the city and our living conditions. The city is a commodity. Competitiveness with other major cities is intended to encourage more start-ups to settle there, more companies researching and producing armaments, more digital service providers and tech companies that consume even more electricity than the millions of Berliners use privately. It is also about e-mobility, which of course does not aim to promote public transport, but rather to put even more metal rolling through the streets powered by lithium batteries, and even more AI-dominated systems spewing out self-driving private vehicles. This is then classified as “infrastructure expansion,” which will cost the state another €3 billion by 2029, after the A100 motorway has eaten its way deeper and deeper into the city. Investments of up to €770 million will be made to renew the power grid.

>This all sounds rather tedious, but it is of great importance to us as residents of Berlin and Brandenburg, because it is our lives, our land, our water, and our future that are being negotiated here. For Giffey, the economic liberal of the SPD, the expansion of grid capacities and new power lines is a central prerequisite for Berlin as an investment location. These economic liberals, destroyers of a livable future, think of the city in terms of numbers, sums of money, growth rates, and competition with other cities. People don't count, or only as low-income or high-income variables. The former must be managed and restricted in some way—including through police and repressive measures, such as walling off a park in Kreuzberg. The latter are flattered, because their money stimulates consumption. For this group, the city is made smart and pretty. Berlin is a brand and is treated as such.

>For Giffay, the expansion of the power grid corresponds to the rapid digitization of everyday life, as if it were a force of nature descending upon us. As if it were not the tech corporations and tech fascists who are deciding on the implementation of AI, which, according to the Federal Ministry of Economics, will double global electricity consumption by 2030. It is not politicians and economic liberals who decide that cash payments will no longer be accepted on BVG buses, forcing people to use digital payments, which also ensures that they can be tracked, in a rebellious city with a tradition of militant movements that need to be controlled. When politicians decide to give the police and secret services access to Palantir surveillance software, whose driving force is a fascist from the US and whose software provides a digital network for monitoring people. Giffay promotes the expansion of the grid with “our” companies and the increasing electrification of mobility: “For the love of Berlin, the most modern power grid for the climate-neutral capital.” And, skilled at defusing criticism, Stromnetz Berlin has included “citizens' councils” as fig leaves, which can exercise ridiculous participation in trivialities but have no say in the direction of energy policy decisions and the design of the city. After Vattenfall and the city were forced by a broad citizens' initiative to initiate a “re-municipalization,” a nationalization of the power grid, and to appoint BEN as the owner, they are continuing business as usual and the madness continues unabated. The vision is clear: Smart City – Stromnetz Berlin says it all: “Berlin is on its way to becoming one of the leading smart city metropolises. This transformation process has already begun in all areas of urban life.” And: “Intelligent infrastructures, and especially the ‘smart grid’ (intelligent power grid), will form the foundation – as a networked operating system, it will become the backbone and catalyst of the energy transition.” Apart from the fact that we consider the term “energy transition” to be window dressing and would replace it with “technological attack on human conditions,” we agree.

>The specific attacks on the Adlershof Technology Park, Tesla's Gigafactory, the infrastructure of Vattenfall's Reuter coal-fired power plant, and Vodafone's hub in Adlershof are reference points for our action, as are the many militant actions that highlight the destruction of our planet. Even if these acts of sabotage cause high financial losses, they cannot force a change in political direction as individual (!) actions. But they point the way and direction that we recommend to all metropolises. Paralyze the infrastructures that serve the “technological attack” and promote the destruction of the earth. The consensus on participation in the project of an imperial way of life can be revoked. A mass social movement against the global destruction of the foundations of life and against all wars and resource plundering goes hand in hand with the ability to sabotage power grids and energy arteries.

>The attack on the gas power plant is an act of international solidarity with all those who protect the earth and life. Our resistance is diverse, and often, in the fog of disinformation, different cultural approaches, and linguistic differences, we still need too much time to recognize our commonalities. But we are confident that in the darkness, the light is not far away. When we place this action in the context of global resistance, whether in the US, Latin America, Asia, China, Russia, Europe, or Australia, against all manifestations of domination, rule, and destruction of the earth, we are confident that we will be heard, that these contributions will be translated, that translated contributions will reach us, that subversive communication will take place on the winding paths of resistance, recognizing each other. And intervening. And doing so without bloodshed, if possible, but determined to cut off the rulers' lifeline.

surpasses all previous records at the same time climate researchers agree that the huge transatlantic ocean currents will eventually break down due to global warming this collapse of the ocean currents which has given the north a mild climate until now is only part of the catastrophe that awaits us the extent of this devastation is simply ignored abstracted and discussed at global climate conferences until the extent of the destruction has disappeared into tables and declarations of intent but the hunger for energy is insatiable and is eating its way through the earth s crust and our lives among other things to feed artificial intelligence which then spews out stereotypes and nonsense and confuses disorients and or manipulates us meanwhile language expression and liveliness are increasingly reduced mutilated and limited with each new learning of ai based on previous data we feed our data into the clouds which are nothing more than gigantic energy guzzling computing and server centers they also drink our drinking water and excrete numbers that bombard us with useless supposedly important spam on our screens until we have forgotten how to look our neighbors in the eye having become dependent on these small devices we are always ready to send an emoji and feed big brother whose algorithm registers our deviations from the norm and answers our search queries before we have even finished thinking we sit together with our friends while the feeds consume us and we sink into our devices instead of talking to each other in real life we are serving our own surveillance and it is total the tech companies are in the hands of men of power which we give them we devour the colorful images that the machines filter for us and starve in front of our screens from loneliness and alienation we are becoming mindless zombies who run each other over in traffic we are prisoners in a digital system that increasingly deprives us of our right to exist if we do not submit to the rules of the game and move our lives to social media chat rooms and artificial realities we don t get any money we can t book or buy anything in cash without access to the digital world we are increasingly excluded losing touch with what seems normal we are afraid of what is happening to us and bury ourselves even deeper into our screens instead of turning off our devices and taking away the power of those who track pursue observe and manipulate us we blind ourselves to the knowledge that edward snowden risked his life to spread we turn a deaf ear to the silent cries of indigenous peoples and farmers who see the planet s lifeline burning before their eyes on the contrary with every post we feed the fire that surrounds us and causes temperatures to rise to new record highs every year one day we will simply sit in front of glowing screens or dead devices and die of thirst and hunger it is no longer difficult to imagine this we re not saying we know the way out but we know we have to stop this destruction hedonism can no longer ensnare us once we ve smelled the cold sweat that spreads when there is no way out no more forward and no more backward only the horror of where we as humanity have ended up when the question comes back to us what did you actually do to prevent what is coming you saw it coming the survivors the next generations will ask us please don t come to us with the parties please don t come to us with the brown alternatives in pinstripe suits and costumes and not with the greens or the left either don t give us the economy whose free market will solve the problem business and politics deal with death every day with dictatorships and butchers concerns are virtually non existent when it comes to satisfying the hunger for energy for example russia is still supplying gas to europe via nord stream and the u s wants venezuela s oil that s why military attacks are now taking place and fracking gas is being shipped in from all over the world currently of it comes from the us fracking is extremely harmful to the environment even during extraction methane losses of to percent are assumed which further heats up the atmosphere of the gas burned in germany is imported climate summits only produce tactical lip service because oil producing countries are not interested in climate protection but in money because metropolitan countries base their policies on money and growth lobbyists in europe are currently being given a free pass on the phase out of combustion engines german minister of economics katharina reiche for example was state secretary in the federal ministry of transport lobbyist for the association of municipal companies vkm and manager at e on subsidiary westenergie e on minister reiche presents herself as a supporter of hydrogen but is primarily focused on natural gas she wants to issue tenders for additional gas fired power plants with a capacity of gigawatts which are to be connected to the grid by corresponding to approximately new power plants billion euros have been earmarked for these new gas fired power plants reiche would prefer to postpone germany s climate neutrality from to anyway the main perpetrators of human induced climate destruction are not those who suffer most from it who pay for it with their health and their lives the people of the global south are already paying the highest price the countries of the global north and soon china among others are deciding the fate of everyone china as a communist racist and patriarchal dictatorship can use rare earths to blackmail countries that do not toe the line gradually weaving countries cultures and political systems into the cocoon of the new dictatorial world power over of the world s refined rare earths come from china and it is the rich who are the problem it is the super rich who are setting the world on fire in the east in the west in the south and in the north percent of the investments made by the super rich worldwide go into gas and oil and around super rich individuals emit more co than the poorest countries in the world these criminals know this they don t care their greed for even more wealth and power sets the standard that everyone follows they are preparing their own rescue on isolated islands or in space once they have burned up this earth a few years ago we would have laughed at these misogynistic crackpots but they are deadly serious zuckerberg wants more masculine energy musk produces children on an assembly line so that his clan will survive none of the perpetrators are solving the problem and the fundamental problem is certainly not being solved at the regional level on the contrary the whole world is arming itself for the final battle for raw materials water food and access to strategically important regions in order to prevent or at least delay the demise of their own spheres of influence so that the population can be offered the chance to participate for as long as possible so that we in the global north cocooned in a world of consumption and an imperial lifestyle can participate and confirm the power of their increasingly authoritarian concepts because it is no longer about freedom for all it is only about security for some the promise of security is an exclusive right of those who can enforce it for themselves we make the losers pay for our imperial lifestyle those who are too weak to defend themselves against us we reject the offers of participation in a burned out world with our militant action that is why we carried out the action at the gas fired power plant in lichterfelde this does not prevent us from becoming entangled in an imperial way of life at the expense of other life but it does send a signal once again as many people and groups in different parts of the world are doing as some groups here such as volcano groups have been doing consistently since we know that these words do not reach many people they are so far removed from the idea of a world and a coexistence that is not based on destruction that these words reach them as little as the misery of the world that is transported daily in high resolution on our screens we can list facts for miles and miles and still not be heard we are not the first and we will not be the last to try to reach people with words anyway we are not the first and last to resort to sabotage because we are playing for time at the same time we and others are using the time we have gained to reverse the destruction of all life forms people call us eco terrorists but we respect life people call us irresponsible but we are taking responsibility to end this imperial destructive way of life our public welfare oriented campaign is socially meaningful we are trying to stop the exploitation of the earth prevent co deaths and halt the diseases associated with the climate catastrophe we are also trying to put an end to species extinction and make the world a better place to live for everyone those who call us eco terrorists are themselves the true eco terrorists expressing this in terms of selfish interests and power calculations we see the unconscious who think they are smart and consider climate change to be fake news they consider empathy to be woke and only have their own interests in mind without recognizing how the things around them are interconnected behind this spreading rejection of facts we see a system of those who invest in the destruction of the earth they are the same people who hold power over the tech companies which allows them to breed a species of humans who applaud when people drown die of thirst starve or otherwise perish in their attempt to reach europe or the us these manipulated prosperity chauvinists and party supporters second trump modi miley netanyahu merz weidel putin h cke orban vans xi and whatever else they are called in their defense of freedom the freedom to decide who must die and who must not who gets access to wealth and who does not yet every refugee who dies while fleeing has their counterpart here in a deep depression every person who starves makes us fatter and sicker we the people of the global north of the rich metropolises derive no benefit from the misery of others material wealth is not wealth in the sense of an idea that can be enjoyed by everyone if only a small portion of the population in every country would say enough is enough not with us not in my name no one should die at our expense if we refuse to function and play along if we become sand in the gears of a machine that we

(fun fact, Saudi Arabia is a strong US ally, who is also partially responsible for helping commit the Genocidal acts in Yemen)

I support the ethnic minorities and other people of Sudan who are being subject to unimaginable atrocities by the UAE funded RSF, as well as being betrayed by their own Sudanese army (fun fact, Israel is a strong ally of the UAE, and made over a billion dollars worth of arms deals with them right before the Sudanese Genocide restarted in 2023)

I support the people of the Eastern DR Congo who are being subject to unimaginable atrocities by the Rwandan funded M 23 (fun fact, Israel is a strong ally of Rwanda and made arms deals with them before the Congolese Genocide restarted in 2025, and they also armed the Hutu supremacist Rwandan government before the Tutsi Genocide of 1994, despite knowing that they hated Tutsis. Israel was also a strong ally of the Mobutu dictatorship, which was one of the most corrupt regimes in recent human history and stole much of the wealth of the Congo from its people in order to make a few friends of the dictator very rich)

I support the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities who are being persecuted by the CCP (fun fact, China is actually Israel's largest trading partner) 

I support the people of Tigray who were subject to unimaginable atrocities by the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies (fun fact, Israel was a strong ally of Ethiopia and made arms deals with their military before the war in which the Genocide took place)

I support the people of Western Sahara who have been subject to apartheid and occupation by the Moroccan government in their struggle to self determination (fun fact, Israel is an ally of Morocco and has made over a billion dollars worth of arms deals with them despite the apartheid and occupation being easily accessible public knowledge)

I support the Rohingya of Myanmar who are being subject to unimaginable atrocities by the Myanmar military (fun fact, Israel went out of their way to break an arms embargo and many weaponds deals with the Myammar military junta despite knowing of the atrocities being committed in the Rohingya Genocide)

I support the people of Haiti, who are being terrorized by gangs roaming the country (fun fact, Israeli and American weapons have been found with Haitian gangs by the UN)

I support the people of West Papua, who are being subject to unimaginable atrocities by the Indonesian military (fun fact, Israeli weapons have been found with the Indonesian military despite the West Papua Genocide being obscure, yet easy to access, public knowledge, and Israel made trade deals with the Suharto dictatorship of Indonesia who committed Genocides in Indonesia and what would become East Timor, despite knowing about the atrocities committed by the regime)

I support the people of Kurdistan and Assyria in their struggles for self determination, and who have been subject to unimaginable atrocities in recent history (fun fact, Israel is an ally of Turkey, which has committed Genocide against the Kurdish people on at least two separate occasions, in the 1920s-30s and 1980s-90s to be particular. The Turkish military has also committed acts of violence against Assyrians caught in the crossfire between them and Kurdish militants opposing the Turkish occupation. Israel made over a billion dollars worth of arms deals with Turkey in the 2000s, even though it continued to occupy Northern Kurdistan and parts of Assyrian lands.)

I support the Armenians of Artsakh who were subject to complete Ethnic Cleansing by the Azerbaijani military (fun fact, Israel is one of Azerbaijan's strongest allies, supplying 70% of their weapons in exchange for Azerbaijan supplying 40% of Israel's oil. Arms deals between the two continued despite the Anti Armenian racism in Azerbaijan that led to the Ethnic Cleansing of 2023)

I support the decolonization movements of Canada, the US, the Caribbean and Latin America (fun fact, Israel armed death squads in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, including the ones responsible for committing the Guatemalan Genocide. Israel also supported the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile and the Argentinian military junta, both of which killed thousands of people in what can only be considered Genocides)

For no particular reason, I would like to remind readers of Israel's strong support for the apartheid regime of South Africa, for the Genocidal French government in Algeria, for the Serb ethnofascists during the Bosnian Genocide and the Sri Lankan government during the Tamil Genocide. 

And I support the Christians and other people of Northern Nigeria who are being subject to unimaginable atrocities by Muslim extremists, as well as the religious minorities in all South Asian countries like Pakistan, India and Bangladesh who are often targets of violence and discrimination, as well, and other people groups suffering because of their ethnicity, religion, nationality and other things they should not be punished for. I will stand with them, regardless of whether Israel contributes to their suffering or not. 

Dear zionists, it seems like your beloved ""oasis of human rights"" has helped persecute many of the people you want me to support. Speaking of which, I rarely see you support them, and when you do, you often  ignore all responsibility that Israel bears for injustice against them. It's almost like you don't actually care about them and only want to use a weak whataboutism argument to both distract from what is happening in Palestine and to personally attack the people speaking out against it. 

Even if Israel never supported the regimes I just talked about, it would not justify, among other things:

The eviction of thousands of Palestinian fellaheen before 1948

The Ethnic Cleansing of the Nakba between 1947 and 49
The continued Ethnic Cleansing of Palestinians (especially the Naqab Bedouin) between 1949 and 1967

The occupation of the rest of Palestine in 1967 which caused another wave of Ethnic Cleansing called the Naksa

The continued Ethnic Cleansing from then until today

The building of illegal settlements both within and outside the Green Line

The terribly inadequate response to settler terrorism against Palestinians

The apartheid against Palestinians through legally protected discrimination in land sales, housing, funding of government institutions and other parts of life

The blockade of Gaza after 2006 and the collective punishment of the population of Gaza that the UN predicted would make the place unliveable by 2020

The Genocide of Gaza from 2023 to 2025 where at least 80,000 identified dead were killed by direct Israeli actions (not to mention the ones who have not yet been found) and where most of Gaza faced some of the worst destruction in modern history. 

The systematic rape and torture in absolutely vile ways, of Palestinians all across Palestine from 1948 until today, causing unimaginable trauma for survivors 

The appropriation of Palestinian heritage, whether that be food, archeological sites, clothing or anything else that is claimed as Israeli when in reality it is not

The very denial of the existence of Palestinians as a distinct people group (let alone an indigenous one) despite numerous records showing South Levantine Arabs identifying as Palestinians well before the zionist movement (and every genetic study including Palestinians confirming that they are Arabized descendants of Bronze Age Levantine groups like Canaanites)

The dehumanization of Palestinians sickeningly prevalent across Israeli society that robs them of the very opportunity to be taken seriously as equal human beings, let alone progress in their lives

1. The main reason 

• China is encircling Taiwan

• In 2027, China will commemorate the 100th anniversary (Centenary) of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)

• Xi Jinping has said his generals to have Taiwan as part of China by 2027.

• 40% of Chinas heavy crude oil imports is from....

U guessed it.... Venezuela....

• Think of how huge China and its population military

• If USA hold venezuelas heavy crude oil supply and stops supply to them, it’s gonna cost China a lot more and harder for them if war starts

2 Secondary reason 

• Venezuela is not a democracy, it’s an authoritarian state

• Means a dictator and his military and intelligence organization is running the country, not the people 

• USA is coming to bring democracy to Venezuela is giving humans in Venezuela political rights 

3 Minor reason 

USA imperialism is way better Chinese imperialism

USA imperialism ideology is democracy, Chinese imperialism ideology is  dictatorship and no form of criticism 

4 Another minor reason 

This is not a republican or a democrat issue. This is an American issue, a global issue for democracy. Hurting Chinese heavy crude oil imports or at least making it more expensive and also meantime bringing democracy to Venezuela is worth a war with Venezuela 

5 India’s Relation

• A weak China is better for India, 

• China has territorial claims on eastern India, 

• China is already occupying a part of Kashmir, 

• During the pahalgam attacks and Indias retaliation on Pakistan. China was fully on pakistans side

• While America was at least bit more neutral maybe even pro India. But definitely more pro India and anti Pakistan than China 

6 Minorities

The Background, Characteristics, and Influence of The Taebaek Mountains

    The film The Taebaek Mountains is adapted from the long novel of the same name by the Korean writer Jo Jung-rae. It tells and depicts a series of historical events that occurred in Beolgyo-eup, Boseong County, South Jeolla Province, during the period from Japan’s surrender to the outbreak of the Korean War. (In Korea, an “eup” is roughly equivalent to a “township” in China.) The Taebaek Mountains presents not only the customs and stories characteristic of South Jeolla Province and the Beolgyo region, but also reflects the historical realities widely seen across the entire “three-thousand-li land” of the Korean Peninsula during those years. After the original work was adapted into a film, the complex narrative was condensed, yet the film still preserved the basic structure of the story, restored the essence conveyed by the novel, and, by making use of the advantages of visual media, rendered the story more vivid, expressive, and emotionally compelling.

    Moreover, the superb direction of Im Kwon-taek—known as the “Godfather of Korean Cinema”—and the outstanding performances of actors such as Ahn Sung-ki, the “national leading actor,” further enhanced the excellence of the film. Upon its release in 1994, the film won more than ten awards, including Best Film at the Blue Dragon Awards, the highest honor in Korean cinema, marking a milestone in Korean film history. 

The publication of the complete version of the novel, as well as the production and release of the film, all took place several years after Korea’s democratization in 1987. For this reason, the film also reflects the social sentiments of the time—when the right-wing military dictatorship had ended, pluralistic democratic politics was beginning to take shape, and Korean society, especially the intellectual community, was reexamining history, calling for humanitarianism, and experiencing the rise of center-left ideologies.

    Yet what the film reflects goes far beyond these aspects; it carries even richer and more complex meanings and values. To explore these, one must examine and analyze the detailed content of the novel and the film one by one.


The Repeated “Changes of Flags” in Beolgyo-eup, South Jeolla Province: Beginning with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident

    At the beginning of the film, subtitles explain the historical background of The Taebaek Mountains: the U.S.–Soviet Cold War and ideological confrontation led to the division and conflict of the Korean Peninsula. The melancholy opening theme and the scene of a flock of geese circling above the Taebaek Mountains foreshadow the tragic nature of this story.

    The film opens with the ringing of telephones in the police station and the youth corps breaking the nighttime quiet of Beolgyo. Yeom Sang-gu, the inspector general of the youth corps who is playing cards, and Nam In-tae, the police chief on duty at the station, hear news of a revolt in Yeosu and the fall of Suncheon. They immediately flee Beolgyo with their men. Meanwhile, Yeom Sang-gu’s elder brother, Yeom Sang-jin—who had joined the South Korean Workers’ Party (the South Korean branch of the Workers’ Party of Korea, conducting underground activities in areas controlled by the Rhee Syngman regime)—leads a guerrilla unit under the command of the South Jeolla Provincial Party Committee, raising the North Korean flag and occupying Beolgyo without a fight.

    The real historical background of this story is the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident of October 1948. Anyone with some knowledge of modern Korean Peninsula history will be familiar with this event. It was the largest military rebellion to occur after the establishment of the Rhee Syngman regime, which governed the southern side of the 38th parallel, and it had major implications for the peninsula’s situation. Before the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident, the Rhee regime’s rule was relatively stable, and Kim Il-sung had not yet decided to invade the South. But after the incident, Kim Il-sung perceived conflict within Rhee’s government and widespread social unrest, and consequently decided to march south to unify the peninsula.

    Indeed, the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident was a concentrated reflection of the unstable military morale, fragmented public sentiment, and social turbulence in the southern half of the peninsula (for convenience, hereafter abbreviated as “South Korea,” even though some events occurred before the formal founding of the Republic of Korea). The immediate trigger for the incident was the refusal of certain Korean troops stationed in Yeosu to suppress the civilian uprising in Jeju. And the cause of the Jeju uprising itself was the military and police suppression of demonstrators. Both the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion and the Jeju uprising were supported and encouraged by the South Korean Workers’ Party.

    The fundamental reason the South Korean Workers’ Party was able to successfully incite revolt was the severe social contradictions in South Korea and the authoritarian and arbitrary rule of the Rhee Syngman regime (these two points will be discussed in later sections). 

Meanwhile, the left-wing forces advocating the establishment of a “communist paradise,” along with the seemingly energetic northern half of the peninsula, held considerable appeal for soldiers and civilians in the South—who were bewildered by chaos and suffered from injustice and exploitation under Rhee. As a result, a series of military and civilian uprisings erupted, with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident being the largest military revolt among them.

    Returning to the film to trace clues: after Yeom Sang-jin’s guerrillas occupy Beolgyo, they enthusiastically contact other rebel forces while immediately launching a purge, subjecting local landlords, bureaucrats, military and police officers, and other anti-communist and pro-government figures to denunciations and executions. Except for Kim Sa-yong, the father of the protagonist Kim Beom-u (played by Ahn Sung-ki), who is spared because he once taught Yeom Sang-jin and helped support his schooling, all other landlords and pro-government anti-communist individuals who failed to flee are killed—over 100 people in total. For a single “eup,” this amounted to a brutal massacre.

    But within less than three days, government forces defeated the rebels holding Suncheon, and the Beolgyo guerrillas were forced to flee hastily—killing civilians perceived as hostile to the left before their retreat. When government troops, police, and militias returned to Beolgyo, they quickly launched retaliatory operations, slaughtering relatives of guerrillas and informants who had cooperated with them. Later, during a series of government military and police purges, many individuals accused of having had secret contact with guerrillas were also killed. At night, the left-wing guerrillas struck back in turn, raiding towns, executing informants, forcibly conscripting young men, and seizing cattle and grain.

    Such cruel cycles of mutual slaughter and retaliation were occurring throughout the peninsula from 1945 to the 1950s. On the surface, these killings stemmed from conflict between two regimes (the Kim Il-sung regime and the Rhee Syngman regime) and two ideologies (communism and feudal capitalism). But the more immediate cause lay in unequal distribution of wealth—especially land—which drove survival-based violence and created vicious cycles of hatred and retaliation.

The Land Issue: The Focal Point of Political Struggles and Ideological Confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, and the Root of Life-and-Death Struggles Among the People

  The land issue on the Korean Peninsula can be traced back to the feudal period of Joseon (here the term “feudal” follows Marxist historiography and related translations, same below). The feudal dynasty of Joseon, similar to China’s ancient dynasties, was also built upon the rule of the landlord class, and the dynasty primarily represented the interests of that class. However, compared with China, the feudal dynasty and entire traditional society of Joseon had an even more rigid structure. 

Joseon’s traditional culture, which inherited and modified Confucian culture from China, became more conservative and more strictly bound by ethical norms and hierarchical propriety. As a result, social classes became even more sharply divided. In ancient Joseon, the “yangban,” composed of aristocrats, officials, scholars, and military officers, were the privileged class of the nation and the ethnicity. They enjoyed far higher status and wealth than commoners, maintained hereditary succession, intermarried among themselves, and formed tightly knit cliques. The most important resource that demonstrated and secured their wealth and status was land.

    The yangban aristocracy controlled most of the land on the Korean Peninsula, but naturally did not cultivate it themselves. They hired tenant farmers to work the land, and these tenants gradually became servants attached to them. Although the peninsula’s tenant farmers were not officially labeled “serfs” like Russian peasants, the degree of oppression they suffered—especially their loss of personal freedom—was in some respects even worse than Russia’s “serfs,” and harsher than what Chinese peasants experienced. This was related to Joseon’s relatively stricter institutional and cultural system, as well as the peninsula’s limited land, dense population, low per-capita farmland, heavy farming pressure, and the lack of any real room for peasants to migrate.

    The yangban aristocrats lived lives of comfort or even indulgence, while peasants survived by cutting expenses and living on the brink of hardship. Whether peasants could live slightly better, or even simply have enough to eat, often depended on the personality or momentary mood of their yangban masters. Therefore, the conflict of interest between the aristocracy and the peasants was extremely severe, and society was highly stratified. Yet due to Joseon’s deep mastery of Confucian traditions and institutional structures adopted from China, the ruling class of Joseon succeeded in maintaining long-term stability. Even in rare instances of dynastic change (far fewer than in China), these were merely changes of power among the elite, with very few peasant revolts.

    Furthermore, although the yangban were extravagant, they also served as the backbone of the Joseon dynasty (and other local regimes on the peninsula), bearing responsibilities such as governing the state, maintaining order, developing the economy, promoting education and culture, undertaking construction projects, and defending against foreign invaders. They were the central force that enabled Goryeo/Joseon civilization to survive and flourish for centuries. It was precisely because they were supported by the peasants that they could escape the hardships of subsistence agriculture, avoid being burdened by farming labor, and instead concentrate on fulfilling their responsibilities.

    Most importantly, the Korean Peninsula is small in area and historically suffered repeated invasions—from Japan in the east, from Chinese dynasties in the west, and from nomadic or hunter-gatherer tribes in the north. Thus, internal unity was necessary to resist external aggression, which to some extent alleviated internal contradictions. In resisting foreign invasions, the yangban played a central role, and peasants could only unite and form military strength under yangban leadership. Under the monarch’s command, the two classes cooperated and enabled the relatively weak Joseon to withstand external threats and preserve statehood and civilization.

    However, this did not mean class contradictions did not exist. On the contrary, long-term oppression resulted in increasing class rigidity and intensifying class antagonism, with resentment accumulating over time. With the opening of the country in the 19th century and the influence of modern civilization, as well as the various impacts of Japanese colonial rule (which created a crisis of national survival while also weakening the rule of the Joseon aristocracy), the yangban system, along with the entire traditional social structure, faced fierce challenges. The Donghak Peasant Revolution, which occurred shortly before the First Sino-Japanese War, was a violent uprising of the Korean peasantry against internal and external oppression.

    After the peninsula became a full colony of Japan in the early 20th century, neither the Japanese colonizers nor Korean right-wing anti-Japanese nationalists and modernizers such as Syngman Rhee advocated thoroughly destroying the old system or the yangban aristocracy, nor did they intend to change land distribution or the broader relations of production. Instead, they actively sought to win over and utilize the old elite.

    For example, while Japanese colonial authorities killed, exiled, or expelled anti-Japanese yangban, they also supported and employed pro-Japanese yangban, transferring the land of the former to the latter. Korean peasants thus suffered dual oppression—from Japanese colonizers and from pro-Japanese yangban aristocrats. And right-wing nationalists represented by Syngman Rhee placed national liberation from Japan above all else, but had no intention of liberating the peasants. Instead, they likewise sought to win over yangban and other landlords and capitalists (after coming to power, the Rhee regime even harmed peasant interests to please the landlord class, which will be discussed later).

    The only forces that firmly advocated completely abolishing yangban privileges, dismantling the traditional social structure, granting peasants and other oppressed groups full citizenship, and equal distribution of wealth were the emerging groups of Korean socialists/communists. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, socialists in Korea were extremely marginalized and merely one branch within the broader nationalist movement. Moreover, due to the peninsula’s small population and limited social and cultural infrastructure, most Korean socialists operated in China, Japan, or Russia, with many holding foreign citizenship rather than Korean citizenship.

    After the victory of the Russian October Revolution and the establishment and rise of the Chinese Communist Party, many Korean socialists in Russia and China joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the CCP. Compared with right-wing nationalists like Syngman Rhee—who were also active abroad but maintained closer ties with anti-colonial movements inside the peninsula (Rhee and others were active mainly in the United States, Western Europe, and Kuomintang-controlled China)—the left-wing socialists remained relatively marginal both abroad and within Korea. For example, the March First Movement—marking the beginning of modern independence struggles on the peninsula—though influenced by the ideology of national self-determination and liberation, was led by traditional landlord elites (yangban) and emergent bourgeois figures (the peasants who joined were merely followers under their landlords’ orders). Its goals were national independence, not socialism or communism.

    Even so, some anti-imperialist and anti-colonial socialists remained active on the peninsula, the most prominent being Pak Hon-yong, who later became the actual leader of the South Korean Workers’ Party. Among the core figures of the later North Korean regime, Pak Hon-yong was the only one who had been long active on the peninsula during the colonial period (others such as Kim Il-sung, Kim Chwae-hyŏk, and Heo Ga-i were mainly active abroad in China or the Soviet Union). The “provincial party,” “county party,” and guerrilla forces mentioned in the film all belonged to the South Korean Workers’ Party established by Pak Hon-yong. It was through the persistent struggle of Pak Hon-yong and others on the peninsula—including enduring imprisonment and torture—that socialist ideology and related movements took root among grassroots populations, forming the foundation for both the establishment of the North Korean regime and the left-wing resistance under the South Korean Rhee government.

    The main promise made by Pak Hon-yong and other socialist/communist activists to mobilize peasants for revolution was the redistribution of land—confiscating all land from the landlord class without compensation and dividing it among peasants, realizing “land to the tiller” and equal prosperity. Of course, they also preached communist ideology to peasants, denouncing the evils of feudal Confucian norms and the injustice of hierarchical systems, and claiming they would establish an earthly paradise of equality. 

Although these ideas contradicted the education instilled in peninsula residents for thousands of years, they nevertheless resonated with many long-oppressed peasants, especially poor tenant farmers. Meanwhile, some intellectuals from relatively affluent or even aristocratic backgrounds were drawn to left-wing ideals out of pure idealism and joined the revolutionary cause at the risk of their lives.

    The left-wing guerrilla forces in the film are precisely those directed and commanded by the South Korean Workers’ Party. In their internal review after retreating from Beolgyo, when Ahn Chang-min, an intellectual, criticized the party’s mistakes, Yeom Sang-jin fiercely demanded that he stop criticizing the party, because “the Party is always sacred and wise; all criticism of the Party is wrong.” This clearly reveals the Party’s strict control over revolutionaries and the severity of party discipline. It also shows that the communist forces in Korea at that time had already developed strong tendencies toward dogmatism and extremism.

    The background composition of the guerrilla core members reflected the typical makeup of participants in the left-wing movement on the peninsula. Yeom Sang-jin was born into a poor farming family, entered the teachers’ college through his diligence, came into contact with left-wing thought, and—combined with his personal and family suffering—became awakened and turned into a revolutionary. 

Ahn Chang-min represented upper-class intellectuals who leaned left; he devoted himself to the left-wing revolution purely for ideals, not personal gain, even betraying his own class background for those ideals. Another figure, Jeong Ha-seop (the guerrilla messenger who gradually develops feelings for the shaman Sohwa), came from a landlord family and, driven by idealism, also became a “progressive youth” who rebelled against his class. But he was younger than Ahn Chang-min and even more passionate and pure in his revolutionary zeal.

    Most other guerrillas were from poor peasant backgrounds. Many joined simply to obtain land or because they could no longer endure landlords’ oppression. For example, the tenant farmers who killed a landlord surnamed So—who had tried to sell land to avoid redistribution—and then defected to the guerrillas, were typical. Many others were forcibly conscripted or semi-forcibly coerced into joining, entering the “revolution” in a confused state.

    Professional revolutionaries as leaders, intellectuals as the backbone, and peasants as the main body—this was the basic composition of the left-wing forces on the Korean Peninsula (the same was true in other agricultural countries such as China and India). Intellectuals joined for the ideal of universal equality, peasants joined to gain their own land, and all aspired to a distant yet beautiful “communist paradise.”

    The rise of left-wing forces advocating land revolution naturally provoked fear among the traditional landlord class. Whether pro-Japanese yangban or nationalist landlords, capitalists, and intellectuals, all intensely hated communist forces. The Japanese colonial authorities violently suppressed left-wing movements—Pak Hon-yong was repeatedly arrested and tortured, once nearly driven insane, and later released and escaped to China only through extensive rescue efforts. Right-wing nationalists led by Syngman Rhee likewise refused to cooperate with the left (and certainly not with communists like Pak Hon-yong or Kim Il-sung), viewing one another as enemies.

    The confrontation and conflict between the left and right, between aristocrats and commoners, and between landlords and tenant farmers continued from the colonial era into the post-liberation period, and became even more violent due to the division of the peninsula—resulting in massive massacres and warfare.

It tells and depicts a series of historical events that occurred in Beolgyo-eup, Boseong County, South Jeolla Province, during the period from Japan’s surrender to the outbreak of the Korean War. (In Korea, an “eup” is roughly equivalent to a “township” in China.) The Taebaek Mountains presents not only the customs and stories characteristic of South Jeolla Province and the Beolgyo region, but also reflects the historical realities widely seen across the entire “three-thousand-li land” of the Korean Peninsula during those years. After the original work was adapted into a film, the complex narrative was condensed, yet the film still preserved the basic structure of the story, restored the essence conveyed by the novel, and, by making use of the advantages of visual media, rendered the story more vivid, expressive, and emotionally compelling.

    Yet what the film reflects goes far beyond these aspects; it carries even richer and more complex meanings and values. To explore these, one must examine and analyze the detailed content of the novel and the film one by one.


The Repeated “Changes of Flags” in Beolgyo-eup, South Jeolla Province: Beginning with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident

    At the beginning of the film, subtitles explain the historical background of The Taebaek Mountains: the U.S.–Soviet Cold War and ideological confrontation led to the division and conflict of the Korean Peninsula. The melancholy opening theme and the scene of a flock of geese circling above the Taebaek Mountains foreshadow the tragic nature of this story.

    The film opens with the ringing of telephones in the police station and the youth corps breaking the nighttime quiet of Beolgyo. Yeom Sang-gu, the inspector general of the youth corps who is playing cards, and Nam In-tae, the police chief on duty at the station, hear news of a revolt in Yeosu and the fall of Suncheon. They immediately flee Beolgyo with their men. Meanwhile, Yeom Sang-gu’s elder brother, Yeom Sang-jin—who had joined the South Korean Workers’ Party (the South Korean branch of the Workers’ Party of Korea, conducting underground activities in areas controlled by the Rhee Syngman regime)—leads a guerrilla unit under the command of the South Jeolla Provincial Party Committee, raising the North Korean flag and occupying Beolgyo without a fight.

    The real historical background of this story is the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident of October 1948. Anyone with some knowledge of modern Korean Peninsula history will be familiar with this event. It was the largest military rebellion to occur after the establishment of the Rhee Syngman regime, which governed the southern side of the 38th parallel, and it had major implications for the peninsula’s situation. Before the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident, the Rhee regime’s rule was relatively stable, and Kim Il-sung had not yet decided to invade the South. But after the incident, Kim Il-sung perceived conflict within Rhee’s government and widespread social unrest, and consequently decided to march south to unify the peninsula.

    Indeed, the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident was a concentrated reflection of the unstable military morale, fragmented public sentiment, and social turbulence in the southern half of the peninsula (for convenience, hereafter abbreviated as “South Korea,” even though some events occurred before the formal founding of the Republic of Korea). The immediate trigger for the incident was the refusal of certain Korean troops stationed in Yeosu to suppress the civilian uprising in Jeju. And the cause of the Jeju uprising itself was the military and police suppression of demonstrators. Both the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion and the Jeju uprising were supported and encouraged by the South Korean Workers’ Party.

    The fundamental reason the South Korean Workers’ Party was able to successfully incite revolt was the severe social contradictions in South Korea and the authoritarian and arbitrary rule of the Rhee Syngman regime (these two points will be discussed in later sections). 

Meanwhile, the left-wing forces advocating the establishment of a “communist paradise,” along with the seemingly energetic northern half of the peninsula, held considerable appeal for soldiers and civilians in the South—who were bewildered by chaos and suffered from injustice and exploitation under Rhee. As a result, a series of military and civilian uprisings erupted, with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident being the largest military revolt among them.

    Returning to the film to trace clues: after Yeom Sang-jin’s guerrillas occupy Beolgyo, they enthusiastically contact other rebel forces while immediately launching a purge, subjecting local landlords, bureaucrats, military and police officers, and other anti-communist and pro-government figures to denunciations and executions. Except for Kim Sa-yong, the father of the protagonist Kim Beom-u (played by Ahn Sung-ki), who is spared because he once taught Yeom Sang-jin and helped support his schooling, all other landlords and pro-government anti-communist individuals who failed to flee are killed—over 100 people in total. For a single “eup,” this amounted to a brutal massacre.

    But within less than three days, government forces defeated the rebels holding Suncheon, and the Beolgyo guerrillas were forced to flee hastily—killing civilians perceived as hostile to the left before their retreat. When government troops, police, and militias returned to Beolgyo, they quickly launched retaliatory operations, slaughtering relatives of guerrillas and informants who had cooperated with them. Later, during a series of government military and police purges, many individuals accused of having had secret contact with guerrillas were also killed. At night, the left-wing guerrillas struck back in turn, raiding towns, executing informants, forcibly conscripting young men, and seizing cattle and grain.

    Such cruel cycles of mutual slaughter and retaliation were occurring throughout the peninsula from 1945 to the 1950s. On the surface, these killings stemmed from conflict between two regimes (the Kim Il-sung regime and the Rhee Syngman regime) and two ideologies (communism and feudal capitalism). But the more immediate cause lay in unequal distribution of wealth—especially land—which drove survival-based violence and created vicious cycles of hatred and retaliation.

The Land Issue: The Focal Point of Political Struggles and Ideological Confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, and the Root of Life-and-Death Struggles Among the People

  The land issue on the Korean Peninsula can be traced back to the feudal period of Joseon (here the term “feudal” follows Marxist historiography and related translations, same below). The feudal dynasty of Joseon, similar to China’s ancient dynasties, was also built upon the rule of the landlord class, and the dynasty primarily represented the interests of that class. However, compared with China, the feudal dynasty and entire traditional society of Joseon had an even more rigid structure. 

Joseon’s traditional culture, which inherited and modified Confucian culture from China, became more conservative and more strictly bound by ethical norms and hierarchical propriety. As a result, social classes became even more sharply divided. In ancient Joseon, the “yangban,” composed of aristocrats, officials, scholars, and military officers, were the privileged class of the nation and the ethnicity. They enjoyed far higher status and wealth than commoners, maintained hereditary succession, intermarried among themselves, and formed tightly knit cliques. The most important resource that demonstrated and secured their wealth and status was land.

    The yangban aristocracy controlled most of the land on the Korean Peninsula, but naturally did not cultivate it themselves. They hired tenant farmers to work the land, and these tenants gradually became servants attached to them. Although the peninsula’s tenant farmers were not officially labeled “serfs” like Russian peasants, the degree of oppression they suffered—especially their loss of personal freedom—was in some respects even worse than Russia’s “serfs,” and harsher than what Chinese peasants experienced. This was related to Joseon’s relatively stricter institutional and cultural system, as well as the peninsula’s limited land, dense population, low per-capita farmland, heavy farming pressure, and the lack of any real room for peasants to migrate.

    The yangban aristocrats lived lives of comfort or even indulgence, while peasants survived by cutting expenses and living on the brink of hardship. Whether peasants could live slightly better, or even simply have enough to eat, often depended on the personality or momentary mood of their yangban masters. Therefore, the conflict of interest between the aristocracy and the peasants was extremely severe, and society was highly stratified. Yet due to Joseon’s deep mastery of Confucian traditions and institutional structures adopted from China, the ruling class of Joseon succeeded in maintaining long-term stability. Even in rare instances of dynastic change (far fewer than in China), these were merely changes of power among the elite, with very few peasant revolts.

    Furthermore, although the yangban were extravagant, they also served as the backbone of the Joseon dynasty (and other local regimes on the peninsula), bearing responsibilities such as governing the state, maintaining order, developing the economy, promoting education and culture, undertaking construction projects, and defending against foreign invaders. They were the central force that enabled Goryeo/Joseon civilization to survive and flourish for centuries. It was precisely because they were supported by the peasants that they could escape the hardships of subsistence agriculture, avoid being burdened by farming labor, and instead concentrate on fulfilling their responsibilities.

    Most importantly, the Korean Peninsula is small in area and historically suffered repeated invasions—from Japan in the east, from Chinese dynasties in the west, and from nomadic or hunter-gatherer tribes in the north. Thus, internal unity was necessary to resist external aggression, which to some extent alleviated internal contradictions. In resisting foreign invasions, the yangban played a central role, and peasants could only unite and form military strength under yangban leadership. Under the monarch’s command, the two classes cooperated and enabled the relatively weak Joseon to withstand external threats and preserve statehood and civilization.

    However, this did not mean class contradictions did not exist. On the contrary, long-term oppression resulted in increasing class rigidity and intensifying class antagonism, with resentment accumulating over time. With the opening of the country in the 19th century and the influence of modern civilization, as well as the various impacts of Japanese colonial rule (which created a crisis of national survival while also weakening the rule of the Joseon aristocracy), the yangban system, along with the entire traditional social structure, faced fierce challenges. The Donghak Peasant Revolution, which occurred shortly before the First Sino-Japanese War, was a violent uprising of the Korean peasantry against internal and external oppression.

    After the peninsula became a full colony of Japan in the early 20th century, neither the Japanese colonizers nor Korean right-wing anti-Japanese nationalists and modernizers such as Syngman Rhee advocated thoroughly destroying the old system or the yangban aristocracy, nor did they intend to change land distribution or the broader relations of production. Instead, they actively sought to win over and utilize the old elite.

    For example, while Japanese colonial authorities killed, exiled, or expelled anti-Japanese yangban, they also supported and employed pro-Japanese yangban, transferring the land of the former to the latter. Korean peasants thus suffered dual oppression—from Japanese colonizers and from pro-Japanese yangban aristocrats. And right-wing nationalists represented by Syngman Rhee placed national liberation from Japan above all else, but had no intention of liberating the peasants. Instead, they likewise sought to win over yangban and other landlords and capitalists (after coming to power, the Rhee regime even harmed peasant interests to please the landlord class, which will be discussed later).

    The only forces that firmly advocated completely abolishing yangban privileges, dismantling the traditional social structure, granting peasants and other oppressed groups full citizenship, and equal distribution of wealth were the emerging groups of Korean socialists/communists. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, socialists in Korea were extremely marginalized and merely one branch within the broader nationalist movement. Moreover, due to the peninsula’s small population and limited social and cultural infrastructure, most Korean socialists operated in China, Japan, or Russia, with many holding foreign citizenship rather than Korean citizenship.

    After the victory of the Russian October Revolution and the establishment and rise of the Chinese Communist Party, many Korean socialists in Russia and China joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the CCP. Compared with right-wing nationalists like Syngman Rhee—who were also active abroad but maintained closer ties with anti-colonial movements inside the peninsula (Rhee and others were active mainly in the United States, Western Europe, and Kuomintang-controlled China)—the left-wing socialists remained relatively marginal both abroad and within Korea. For example, the March First Movement—marking the beginning of modern independence struggles on the peninsula—though influenced by the ideology of national self-determination and liberation, was led by traditional landlord elites (yangban) and emergent bourgeois figures (the peasants who joined were merely followers under their landlords’ orders). Its goals were national independence, not socialism or communism.

    Even so, some anti-imperialist and anti-colonial socialists remained active on the peninsula, the most prominent being Pak Hon-yong, who later became the actual leader of the South Korean Workers’ Party. Among the core figures of the later North Korean regime, Pak Hon-yong was the only one who had been long active on the peninsula during the colonial period (others such as Kim Il-sung, Kim Chwae-hyŏk, and Heo Ga-i were mainly active abroad in China or the Soviet Union). The “provincial party,” “county party,” and guerrilla forces mentioned in the film all belonged to the South Korean Workers’ Party established by Pak Hon-yong. It was through the persistent struggle of Pak Hon-yong and others on the peninsula—including enduring imprisonment and torture—that socialist ideology and related movements took root among grassroots populations, forming the foundation for both the establishment of the North Korean regime and the left-wing resistance under the South Korean Rhee government.

    The main promise made by Pak Hon-yong and other socialist/communist activists to mobilize peasants for revolution was the redistribution of land—confiscating all land from the landlord class without compensation and dividing it among peasants, realizing “land to the tiller” and equal prosperity. Of course, they also preached communist ideology to peasants, denouncing the evils of feudal Confucian norms and the injustice of hierarchical systems, and claiming they would establish an earthly paradise of equality. 

Although these ideas contradicted the education instilled in peninsula residents for thousands of years, they nevertheless resonated with many long-oppressed peasants, especially poor tenant farmers. Meanwhile, some intellectuals from relatively affluent or even aristocratic backgrounds were drawn to left-wing ideals out of pure idealism and joined the revolutionary cause at the risk of their lives.

    The left-wing guerrilla forces in the film are precisely those directed and commanded by the South Korean Workers’ Party. In their internal review after retreating from Beolgyo, when Ahn Chang-min, an intellectual, criticized the party’s mistakes, Yeom Sang-jin fiercely demanded that he stop criticizing the party, because “the Party is always sacred and wise; all criticism of the Party is wrong.” This clearly reveals the Party’s strict control over revolutionaries and the severity of party discipline. It also shows that the communist forces in Korea at that time had already developed strong tendencies toward dogmatism and extremism.

    The background composition of the guerrilla core members reflected the typical makeup of participants in the left-wing movement on the peninsula. Yeom Sang-jin was born into a poor farming family, entered the teachers’ college through his diligence, came into contact with left-wing thought, and—combined with his personal and family suffering—became awakened and turned into a revolutionary. 

Ahn Chang-min represented upper-class intellectuals who leaned left; he devoted himself to the left-wing revolution purely for ideals, not personal gain, even betraying his own class background for those ideals. Another figure, Jeong Ha-seop (the guerrilla messenger who gradually develops feelings for the shaman Sohwa), came from a landlord family and, driven by idealism, also became a “progressive youth” who rebelled against his class. But he was younger than Ahn Chang-min and even more passionate and pure in his revolutionary zeal.

    Most other guerrillas were from poor peasant backgrounds. Many joined simply to obtain land or because they could no longer endure landlords’ oppression. For example, the tenant farmers who killed a landlord surnamed So—who had tried to sell land to avoid redistribution—and then defected to the guerrillas, were typical. Many others were forcibly conscripted or semi-forcibly coerced into joining, entering the “revolution” in a confused state.

    Professional revolutionaries as leaders, intellectuals as the backbone, and peasants as the main body—this was the basic composition of the left-wing forces on the Korean Peninsula (the same was true in other agricultural countries such as China and India). Intellectuals joined for the ideal of universal equality, peasants joined to gain their own land, and all aspired to a distant yet beautiful “communist paradise.”

    The rise of left-wing forces advocating land revolution naturally provoked fear among the traditional landlord class. Whether pro-Japanese yangban or nationalist landlords, capitalists, and intellectuals, all intensely hated communist forces. The Japanese colonial authorities violently suppressed left-wing movements—Pak Hon-yong was repeatedly arrested and tortured, once nearly driven insane, and later released and escaped to China only through extensive rescue efforts. Right-wing nationalists led by Syngman Rhee likewise refused to cooperate with the left (and certainly not with communists like Pak Hon-yong or Kim Il-sung), viewing one another as enemies.

    The confrontation and conflict between the left and right, between aristocrats and commoners, and between landlords and tenant farmers continued from the colonial era into the post-liberation period, and became even more violent due to the division of the peninsula—resulting in massive massacres and warfare.

in china the taebaek mountains presents not only the customs and stories characteristic of south jeolla province and the beolgyo region but also reflects the historical realities widely seen across the entire three thousand li land of the korean peninsula during those years after the original work was adapted into a film the complex narrative was condensed yet the film still preserved the basic structure of the story restored the essence conveyed by the novel and by making use of the advantages of visual media rendered the story more vivid expressive and emotionally compelling moreover the superb direction of im kwon taek known as the godfather of korean cinema and the outstanding performances of actors such as ahn sung ki the national leading actor further enhanced the excellence of the film upon its release in the film won more than ten awards including best film at the blue dragon awards the highest honor in korean cinema marking a milestone in korean film history the publication of the complete version of the novel as well as the production and release of the film all took place several years after korea s democratization in for this reason the film also reflects the social sentiments of the time when the right wing military dictatorship had ended pluralistic democratic politics was beginning to take shape and korean society especially the intellectual community was reexamining history calling for humanitarianism and experiencing the rise of center left ideologies yet what the film reflects goes far beyond these aspects it carries even richer and more complex meanings and values to explore these one must examine and analyze the detailed content of the novel and the film one by one the repeated changes of flags in beolgyo eup south jeolla province beginning with the yeosu suncheon incident at the beginning of the film subtitles explain the historical background of the taebaek mountains the u s soviet cold war and ideological confrontation led to the division and conflict of the korean peninsula the melancholy opening theme and the scene of a flock of geese circling above the taebaek mountains foreshadow the tragic nature of this story the film opens with the ringing of telephones in the police station and the youth corps breaking the nighttime quiet of beolgyo yeom sang gu the inspector general of the youth corps who is playing cards and nam in tae the police chief on duty at the station hear news of a revolt in yeosu and the fall of suncheon they immediately flee beolgyo with their men meanwhile yeom sang gu s elder brother yeom sang jin who had joined the south korean workers party the south korean branch of the workers party of korea conducting underground activities in areas controlled by the rhee syngman regime leads a guerrilla unit under the command of the south jeolla provincial party committee raising the north korean flag and occupying beolgyo without a fight the real historical background of this story is the yeosu suncheon incident of october anyone with some knowledge of modern korean peninsula history will be familiar with this event it was the largest military rebellion to occur after the establishment of the rhee syngman regime which governed the southern side of the th parallel and it had major implications for the peninsula s situation before the yeosu suncheon incident the rhee regime s rule was relatively stable and kim il sung had not yet decided to invade the south but after the incident kim il sung perceived conflict within rhee s government and widespread social unrest and consequently decided to march south to unify the peninsula indeed the yeosu suncheon incident was a concentrated reflection of the unstable military morale fragmented public sentiment and social turbulence in the southern half of the peninsula for convenience hereafter abbreviated as south korea even though some events occurred before the formal founding of the republic of korea the immediate trigger for the incident was the refusal of certain korean troops stationed in yeosu to suppress the civilian uprising in jeju and the cause of the jeju uprising itself was the military and police suppression of demonstrators both the yeosu suncheon rebellion and the jeju uprising were supported and encouraged by the south korean workers party the fundamental reason the south korean workers party was able to successfully incite revolt was the severe social contradictions in south korea and the authoritarian and arbitrary rule of the rhee syngman regime these two points will be discussed in later sections meanwhile the left wing forces advocating the establishment of a communist paradise along with the seemingly energetic northern half of the peninsula held considerable appeal for soldiers and civilians in the south who were bewildered by chaos and suffered from injustice and exploitation under rhee as a result a series of military and civilian uprisings erupted with the yeosu suncheon incident being the largest military revolt among them returning to the film to trace clues after yeom sang jin s guerrillas occupy beolgyo they enthusiastically contact other rebel forces while immediately launching a purge subjecting local landlords bureaucrats military and police officers and other anti communist and pro government figures to denunciations and executions except for kim sa yong the father of the protagonist kim beom u played by ahn sung ki who is spared because he once taught yeom sang jin and helped support his schooling all other landlords and pro government anti communist individuals who failed to flee are killed over people in total for a single eup this amounted to a brutal massacre but within less than three days government forces defeated the rebels holding suncheon and the beolgyo guerrillas were forced to flee hastily killing civilians perceived as hostile to the left before their retreat when government troops police and militias returned to beolgyo they quickly launched retaliatory operations slaughtering relatives of guerrillas and informants who had cooperated with them later during a series of government military and police purges many individuals accused of having had secret contact with guerrillas were also killed at night the left wing guerrillas struck back in turn raiding towns executing informants forcibly conscripting young men and seizing cattle and grain such cruel cycles of mutual slaughter and retaliation were occurring throughout the peninsula from to the s on the surface these killings stemmed from conflict between two regimes the kim il sung regime and the rhee syngman regime and two ideologies communism and feudal capitalism but the more immediate cause lay in unequal distribution of wealth especially land which drove survival based violence and created vicious cycles of hatred and retaliation the land issue the focal point of political struggles and ideological confrontation on the korean peninsula and the root of life and death struggles among the people the land issue on the korean peninsula can be traced back to the feudal period of joseon here the term feudal follows marxist historiography and related translations same below the feudal dynasty of joseon similar to china s ancient dynasties was also built upon the rule of the landlord class and the dynasty primarily represented the interests of that class however compared with china the feudal dynasty and entire traditional society of joseon had an even more rigid structure joseon s traditional culture which inherited and modified confucian culture from china became more conservative and more strictly bound by ethical norms and hierarchical propriety as a result social classes became even more sharply divided in ancient joseon the yangban composed of aristocrats officials scholars and military officers were the privileged class of the nation and the ethnicity they enjoyed far higher status and wealth than commoners maintained hereditary succession intermarried among themselves and formed tightly knit cliques the most important resource that demonstrated and secured their wealth and status was land the yangban aristocracy controlled most of the land on the korean peninsula but naturally did not cultivate it themselves they hired tenant farmers to work the land and these tenants gradually became servants attached to them although the peninsula s tenant farmers were not officially labeled serfs like russian peasants the degree of oppression they suffered especially their loss of personal freedom was in some respects even worse than russia s serfs and harsher than what chinese peasants experienced this was related to joseon s relatively stricter institutional and cultural system as well as the peninsula s limited land dense population low per capita farmland heavy farming pressure and the lack of any real room for peasants to migrate the yangban aristocrats lived lives of comfort or even indulgence while peasants survived by cutting expenses and living on the brink of hardship whether peasants could live slightly better or even simply have enough to eat often depended on the personality or momentary mood of their yangban masters therefore the conflict of interest between the aristocracy and the peasants was extremely severe and society was highly stratified yet due to joseon s deep mastery of confucian traditions and institutional structures adopted from china the ruling class of joseon succeeded in maintaining long term stability even in rare instances of dynastic change far fewer than in china these were merely changes of power among the elite with very few peasant revolts furthermore although the yangban were extravagant they also served as the backbone of the joseon dynasty and other local regimes on the peninsula bearing responsibilities such as governing the state maintaining order developing the economy promoting education and culture undertaking construction projects and defending against foreign invaders they were the central force that enabled goryeo joseon civilization to survive and flourish for centuries it was precisely because they were supported by the peasants that they could escape the hardships of subsistence agriculture avoid being burdened by farming labor and instead concentrate on fulfilling their responsibilities most importantly the korean peninsula is small in area and historically suffered repeated invasions from japan in the east from chinese dynasties in the west and from nomadic or hunter gatherer tribes in the north thus internal unity was necessary to resist external aggression which to some extent alleviated internal contradictions in resisting foreign invasions the yangban played a central role and peasants could only unite and form military strength under yangban leadership under the monarch s command the two classes cooperated and enabled the relatively weak joseon to withstand external threats and preserve statehood and civilization however this did not mean class contradictions did not exist on the contrary long term oppression resulted in increasing class rigidity and intensifying class antagonism with resentment accumulating over time with the opening of the country in the th century and the influence of modern civilization as well as the various impacts of japanese colonial rule which created a crisis of national survival while also weakening the rule of the joseon aristocracy the yangban system along with the entire traditional social structure faced fierce challenges the donghak peasant revolution which occurred shortly before the first sino japanese war was a violent uprising of the korean peasantry against internal and external

When devotees established temples and preaching centers around the world, they did so as soldiers, building bases for global regime change. Cult members seriously believed this would happen in their lifetimes. They were waiting for Krishna to magically make it all happen.

When this didn't happen, devotees put their hopes in nuclear war. They believed the world would be destroyed in a nuclear holocaust and devotees would emerge from hiding to take control.

ISKCON is arguably more extreme than the Shia Islamic rulers of Iran. Hare Krishna's reject all modern technology as demonic and want to reduce the world to nothing but agriculture. Devotees are hypocritically obsessed with technology. They justify it by saying they are using technology to conquer the world, after which they will get rid of technology.

They advocate for ""spiritual communism"" modeled on an idealized version of Indian village life circa 500 BCE. Our technologies and our rights will be stripped from us. When we see the light, we will willingly become happy peasants, chanting Hare Krishna while we work the land. I imagine all land will eventually belong to ISKCON, which will extract 50% of our earnings. Prabhupada said.

Of course, ISKCON members and their descendants will not be peasants. They will the new Brahman class, turbaned Maharajas who live like fat greedy Zamindars; indoctrinating others into submission and living in luxury.

They will fly in on airplanes, and visit the theocracy to be worshiped as senior devotees, carried on palanquins, fanned with chamaras by wide eyed brainwashed servants. They will demonstrate their purity by complaining about how degraded they find the West, sharing stories of their glory days as radical revolutionaries working to tear it all down.

The Background, Characteristics, and Influence of The Taebaek Mountains

    The film The Taebaek Mountains is adapted from the long novel of the same name by the Korean writer Jo Jung-rae. It tells and depicts a series of historical events that occurred in Beolgyo-eup, Boseong County, South Jeolla Province, during the period from Japan’s surrender to the outbreak of the Korean War. (In Korea, an “eup” is roughly equivalent to a “township” in China.) The Taebaek Mountains presents not only the customs and stories characteristic of South Jeolla Province and the Beolgyo region, but also reflects the historical realities widely seen across the entire “three-thousand-li land” of the Korean Peninsula during those years. After the original work was adapted into a film, the complex narrative was condensed, yet the film still preserved the basic structure of the story, restored the essence conveyed by the novel, and, by making use of the advantages of visual media, rendered the story more vivid, expressive, and emotionally compelling.

    Moreover, the superb direction of Im Kwon-taek—known as the “Godfather of Korean Cinema”—and the outstanding performances of actors such as Ahn Sung-ki, the “national leading actor,” further enhanced the excellence of the film. Upon its release in 1994, the film won more than ten awards, including Best Film at the Blue Dragon Awards, the highest honor in Korean cinema, marking a milestone in Korean film history. 

The publication of the complete version of the novel, as well as the production and release of the film, all took place several years after Korea’s democratization in 1987. For this reason, the film also reflects the social sentiments of the time—when the right-wing military dictatorship had ended, pluralistic democratic politics was beginning to take shape, and Korean society, especially the intellectual community, was reexamining history, calling for humanitarianism, and experiencing the rise of center-left ideologies.

    Yet what the film reflects goes far beyond these aspects; it carries even richer and more complex meanings and values. To explore these, one must examine and analyze the detailed content of the novel and the film one by one.


The Repeated “Changes of Flags” in Beolgyo-eup, South Jeolla Province: Beginning with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident

    At the beginning of the film, subtitles explain the historical background of The Taebaek Mountains: the U.S.–Soviet Cold War and ideological confrontation led to the division and conflict of the Korean Peninsula. The melancholy opening theme and the scene of a flock of geese circling above the Taebaek Mountains foreshadow the tragic nature of this story.

    The film opens with the ringing of telephones in the police station and the youth corps breaking the nighttime quiet of Beolgyo. Yeom Sang-gu, the inspector general of the youth corps who is playing cards, and Nam In-tae, the police chief on duty at the station, hear news of a revolt in Yeosu and the fall of Suncheon. They immediately flee Beolgyo with their men. Meanwhile, Yeom Sang-gu’s elder brother, Yeom Sang-jin—who had joined the South Korean Workers’ Party (the South Korean branch of the Workers’ Party of Korea, conducting underground activities in areas controlled by the Rhee Syngman regime)—leads a guerrilla unit under the command of the South Jeolla Provincial Party Committee, raising the North Korean flag and occupying Beolgyo without a fight.

    The real historical background of this story is the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident of October 1948. Anyone with some knowledge of modern Korean Peninsula history will be familiar with this event. It was the largest military rebellion to occur after the establishment of the Rhee Syngman regime, which governed the southern side of the 38th parallel, and it had major implications for the peninsula’s situation. Before the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident, the Rhee regime’s rule was relatively stable, and Kim Il-sung had not yet decided to invade the South. But after the incident, Kim Il-sung perceived conflict within Rhee’s government and widespread social unrest, and consequently decided to march south to unify the peninsula.

    Indeed, the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident was a concentrated reflection of the unstable military morale, fragmented public sentiment, and social turbulence in the southern half of the peninsula (for convenience, hereafter abbreviated as “South Korea,” even though some events occurred before the formal founding of the Republic of Korea). The immediate trigger for the incident was the refusal of certain Korean troops stationed in Yeosu to suppress the civilian uprising in Jeju. And the cause of the Jeju uprising itself was the military and police suppression of demonstrators. Both the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion and the Jeju uprising were supported and encouraged by the South Korean Workers’ Party.

    The fundamental reason the South Korean Workers’ Party was able to successfully incite revolt was the severe social contradictions in South Korea and the authoritarian and arbitrary rule of the Rhee Syngman regime (these two points will be discussed in later sections). 

Meanwhile, the left-wing forces advocating the establishment of a “communist paradise,” along with the seemingly energetic northern half of the peninsula, held considerable appeal for soldiers and civilians in the South—who were bewildered by chaos and suffered from injustice and exploitation under Rhee. As a result, a series of military and civilian uprisings erupted, with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident being the largest military revolt among them.

    Returning to the film to trace clues: after Yeom Sang-jin’s guerrillas occupy Beolgyo, they enthusiastically contact other rebel forces while immediately launching a purge, subjecting local landlords, bureaucrats, military and police officers, and other anti-communist and pro-government figures to denunciations and executions. Except for Kim Sa-yong, the father of the protagonist Kim Beom-u (played by Ahn Sung-ki), who is spared because he once taught Yeom Sang-jin and helped support his schooling, all other landlords and pro-government anti-communist individuals who failed to flee are killed—over 100 people in total. For a single “eup,” this amounted to a brutal massacre.

    But within less than three days, government forces defeated the rebels holding Suncheon, and the Beolgyo guerrillas were forced to flee hastily—killing civilians perceived as hostile to the left before their retreat. When government troops, police, and militias returned to Beolgyo, they quickly launched retaliatory operations, slaughtering relatives of guerrillas and informants who had cooperated with them. Later, during a series of government military and police purges, many individuals accused of having had secret contact with guerrillas were also killed. At night, the left-wing guerrillas struck back in turn, raiding towns, executing informants, forcibly conscripting young men, and seizing cattle and grain.

    Such cruel cycles of mutual slaughter and retaliation were occurring throughout the peninsula from 1945 to the 1950s. On the surface, these killings stemmed from conflict between two regimes (the Kim Il-sung regime and the Rhee Syngman regime) and two ideologies (communism and feudal capitalism). But the more immediate cause lay in unequal distribution of wealth—especially land—which drove survival-based violence and created vicious cycles of hatred and retaliation.

The Land Issue: The Focal Point of Political Struggles and Ideological Confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, and the Root of Life-and-Death Struggles Among the People

  The land issue on the Korean Peninsula can be traced back to the feudal period of Joseon (here the term “feudal” follows Marxist historiography and related translations, same below). The feudal dynasty of Joseon, similar to China’s ancient dynasties, was also built upon the rule of the landlord class, and the dynasty primarily represented the interests of that class. However, compared with China, the feudal dynasty and entire traditional society of Joseon had an even more rigid structure. 

Joseon’s traditional culture, which inherited and modified Confucian culture from China, became more conservative and more strictly bound by ethical norms and hierarchical propriety. As a result, social classes became even more sharply divided. In ancient Joseon, the “yangban,” composed of aristocrats, officials, scholars, and military officers, were the privileged class of the nation and the ethnicity. They enjoyed far higher status and wealth than commoners, maintained hereditary succession, intermarried among themselves, and formed tightly knit cliques. The most important resource that demonstrated and secured their wealth and status was land.

    The yangban aristocracy controlled most of the land on the Korean Peninsula, but naturally did not cultivate it themselves. They hired tenant farmers to work the land, and these tenants gradually became servants attached to them. Although the peninsula’s tenant farmers were not officially labeled “serfs” like Russian peasants, the degree of oppression they suffered—especially their loss of personal freedom—was in some respects even worse than Russia’s “serfs,” and harsher than what Chinese peasants experienced. This was related to Joseon’s relatively stricter institutional and cultural system, as well as the peninsula’s limited land, dense population, low per-capita farmland, heavy farming pressure, and the lack of any real room for peasants to migrate.

    The yangban aristocrats lived lives of comfort or even indulgence, while peasants survived by cutting expenses and living on the brink of hardship. Whether peasants could live slightly better, or even simply have enough to eat, often depended on the personality or momentary mood of their yangban masters. Therefore, the conflict of interest between the aristocracy and the peasants was extremely severe, and society was highly stratified. Yet due to Joseon’s deep mastery of Confucian traditions and institutional structures adopted from China, the ruling class of Joseon succeeded in maintaining long-term stability. Even in rare instances of dynastic change (far fewer than in China), these were merely changes of power among the elite, with very few peasant revolts.

    Furthermore, although the yangban were extravagant, they also served as the backbone of the Joseon dynasty (and other local regimes on the peninsula), bearing responsibilities such as governing the state, maintaining order, developing the economy, promoting education and culture, undertaking construction projects, and defending against foreign invaders. They were the central force that enabled Goryeo/Joseon civilization to survive and flourish for centuries. It was precisely because they were supported by the peasants that they could escape the hardships of subsistence agriculture, avoid being burdened by farming labor, and instead concentrate on fulfilling their responsibilities.

    Most importantly, the Korean Peninsula is small in area and historically suffered repeated invasions—from Japan in the east, from Chinese dynasties in the west, and from nomadic or hunter-gatherer tribes in the north. Thus, internal unity was necessary to resist external aggression, which to some extent alleviated internal contradictions. In resisting foreign invasions, the yangban played a central role, and peasants could only unite and form military strength under yangban leadership. Under the monarch’s command, the two classes cooperated and enabled the relatively weak Joseon to withstand external threats and preserve statehood and civilization.

    However, this did not mean class contradictions did not exist. On the contrary, long-term oppression resulted in increasing class rigidity and intensifying class antagonism, with resentment accumulating over time. With the opening of the country in the 19th century and the influence of modern civilization, as well as the various impacts of Japanese colonial rule (which created a crisis of national survival while also weakening the rule of the Joseon aristocracy), the yangban system, along with the entire traditional social structure, faced fierce challenges. The Donghak Peasant Revolution, which occurred shortly before the First Sino-Japanese War, was a violent uprising of the Korean peasantry against internal and external oppression.

    After the peninsula became a full colony of Japan in the early 20th century, neither the Japanese colonizers nor Korean right-wing anti-Japanese nationalists and modernizers such as Syngman Rhee advocated thoroughly destroying the old system or the yangban aristocracy, nor did they intend to change land distribution or the broader relations of production. Instead, they actively sought to win over and utilize the old elite.

    For example, while Japanese colonial authorities killed, exiled, or expelled anti-Japanese yangban, they also supported and employed pro-Japanese yangban, transferring the land of the former to the latter. Korean peasants thus suffered dual oppression—from Japanese colonizers and from pro-Japanese yangban aristocrats. And right-wing nationalists represented by Syngman Rhee placed national liberation from Japan above all else, but had no intention of liberating the peasants. Instead, they likewise sought to win over yangban and other landlords and capitalists (after coming to power, the Rhee regime even harmed peasant interests to please the landlord class, which will be discussed later).

    The only forces that firmly advocated completely abolishing yangban privileges, dismantling the traditional social structure, granting peasants and other oppressed groups full citizenship, and equal distribution of wealth were the emerging groups of Korean socialists/communists. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, socialists in Korea were extremely marginalized and merely one branch within the broader nationalist movement. Moreover, due to the peninsula’s small population and limited social and cultural infrastructure, most Korean socialists operated in China, Japan, or Russia, with many holding foreign citizenship rather than Korean citizenship.

    After the victory of the Russian October Revolution and the establishment and rise of the Chinese Communist Party, many Korean socialists in Russia and China joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the CCP. Compared with right-wing nationalists like Syngman Rhee—who were also active abroad but maintained closer ties with anti-colonial movements inside the peninsula (Rhee and others were active mainly in the United States, Western Europe, and Kuomintang-controlled China)—the left-wing socialists remained relatively marginal both abroad and within Korea. For example, the March First Movement—marking the beginning of modern independence struggles on the peninsula—though influenced by the ideology of national self-determination and liberation, was led by traditional landlord elites (yangban) and emergent bourgeois figures (the peasants who joined were merely followers under their landlords’ orders). Its goals were national independence, not socialism or communism.

    Even so, some anti-imperialist and anti-colonial socialists remained active on the peninsula, the most prominent being Pak Hon-yong, who later became the actual leader of the South Korean Workers’ Party. Among the core figures of the later North Korean regime, Pak Hon-yong was the only one who had been long active on the peninsula during the colonial period (others such as Kim Il-sung, Kim Chwae-hyŏk, and Heo Ga-i were mainly active abroad in China or the Soviet Union). The “provincial party,” “county party,” and guerrilla forces mentioned in the film all belonged to the South Korean Workers’ Party established by Pak Hon-yong. It was through the persistent struggle of Pak Hon-yong and others on the peninsula—including enduring imprisonment and torture—that socialist ideology and related movements took root among grassroots populations, forming the foundation for both the establishment of the North Korean regime and the left-wing resistance under the South Korean Rhee government.

    The main promise made by Pak Hon-yong and other socialist/communist activists to mobilize peasants for revolution was the redistribution of land—confiscating all land from the landlord class without compensation and dividing it among peasants, realizing “land to the tiller” and equal prosperity. Of course, they also preached communist ideology to peasants, denouncing the evils of feudal Confucian norms and the injustice of hierarchical systems, and claiming they would establish an earthly paradise of equality. 

Although these ideas contradicted the education instilled in peninsula residents for thousands of years, they nevertheless resonated with many long-oppressed peasants, especially poor tenant farmers. Meanwhile, some intellectuals from relatively affluent or even aristocratic backgrounds were drawn to left-wing ideals out of pure idealism and joined the revolutionary cause at the risk of their lives.

    The left-wing guerrilla forces in the film are precisely those directed and commanded by the South Korean Workers’ Party. In their internal review after retreating from Beolgyo, when Ahn Chang-min, an intellectual, criticized the party’s mistakes, Yeom Sang-jin fiercely demanded that he stop criticizing the party, because “the Party is always sacred and wise; all criticism of the Party is wrong.” This clearly reveals the Party’s strict control over revolutionaries and the severity of party discipline. It also shows that the communist forces in Korea at that time had already developed strong tendencies toward dogmatism and extremism.

    The background composition of the guerrilla core members reflected the typical makeup of participants in the left-wing movement on the peninsula. Yeom Sang-jin was born into a poor farming family, entered the teachers’ college through his diligence, came into contact with left-wing thought, and—combined with his personal and family suffering—became awakened and turned into a revolutionary. 

Ahn Chang-min represented upper-class intellectuals who leaned left; he devoted himself to the left-wing revolution purely for ideals, not personal gain, even betraying his own class background for those ideals. Another figure, Jeong Ha-seop (the guerrilla messenger who gradually develops feelings for the shaman Sohwa), came from a landlord family and, driven by idealism, also became a “progressive youth” who rebelled against his class. But he was younger than Ahn Chang-min and even more passionate and pure in his revolutionary zeal.

    Most other guerrillas were from poor peasant backgrounds. Many joined simply to obtain land or because they could no longer endure landlords’ oppression. For example, the tenant farmers who killed a landlord surnamed So—who had tried to sell land to avoid redistribution—and then defected to the guerrillas, were typical. Many others were forcibly conscripted or semi-forcibly coerced into joining, entering the “revolution” in a confused state.

    Professional revolutionaries as leaders, intellectuals as the backbone, and peasants as the main body—this was the basic composition of the left-wing forces on the Korean Peninsula (the same was true in other agricultural countries such as China and India). Intellectuals joined for the ideal of universal equality, peasants joined to gain their own land, and all aspired to a distant yet beautiful “communist paradise.”

    The rise of left-wing forces advocating land revolution naturally provoked fear among the traditional landlord class. Whether pro-Japanese yangban or nationalist landlords, capitalists, and intellectuals, all intensely hated communist forces. The Japanese colonial authorities violently suppressed left-wing movements—Pak Hon-yong was repeatedly arrested and tortured, once nearly driven insane, and later released and escaped to China only through extensive rescue efforts. Right-wing nationalists led by Syngman Rhee likewise refused to cooperate with the left (and certainly not with communists like Pak Hon-yong or Kim Il-sung), viewing one another as enemies.

    The confrontation and conflict between the left and right, between aristocrats and commoners, and between landlords and tenant farmers continued from the colonial era into the post-liberation period, and became even more violent due to the division of the peninsula—resulting in massive massacres and warfare.

The Background, Characteristics, and Influence of The Taebaek Mountains

    The film The Taebaek Mountains is adapted from the long novel of the same name by the Korean writer Jo Jung-rae. It tells and depicts a series of historical events that occurred in Beolgyo-eup, Boseong County, South Jeolla Province, during the period from Japan’s surrender to the outbreak of the Korean War. (In Korea, an “eup” is roughly equivalent to a “township” in China.) The Taebaek Mountains presents not only the customs and stories characteristic of South Jeolla Province and the Beolgyo region, but also reflects the historical realities widely seen across the entire “three-thousand-li land” of the Korean Peninsula during those years. After the original work was adapted into a film, the complex narrative was condensed, yet the film still preserved the basic structure of the story, restored the essence conveyed by the novel, and, by making use of the advantages of visual media, rendered the story more vivid, expressive, and emotionally compelling.

    Moreover, the superb direction of Im Kwon-taek—known as the “Godfather of Korean Cinema”—and the outstanding performances of actors such as Ahn Sung-ki, the “national leading actor,” further enhanced the excellence of the film. Upon its release in 1994, the film won more than ten awards, including Best Film at the Blue Dragon Awards, the highest honor in Korean cinema, marking a milestone in Korean film history. 

The publication of the complete version of the novel, as well as the production and release of the film, all took place several years after Korea’s democratization in 1987. For this reason, the film also reflects the social sentiments of the time—when the right-wing military dictatorship had ended, pluralistic democratic politics was beginning to take shape, and Korean society, especially the intellectual community, was reexamining history, calling for humanitarianism, and experiencing the rise of center-left ideologies.

    Yet what the film reflects goes far beyond these aspects; it carries even richer and more complex meanings and values. To explore these, one must examine and analyze the detailed content of the novel and the film one by one.


The Repeated “Changes of Flags” in Beolgyo-eup, South Jeolla Province: Beginning with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident

    At the beginning of the film, subtitles explain the historical background of The Taebaek Mountains: the U.S.–Soviet Cold War and ideological confrontation led to the division and conflict of the Korean Peninsula. The melancholy opening theme and the scene of a flock of geese circling above the Taebaek Mountains foreshadow the tragic nature of this story.

    The film opens with the ringing of telephones in the police station and the youth corps breaking the nighttime quiet of Beolgyo. Yeom Sang-gu, the inspector general of the youth corps who is playing cards, and Nam In-tae, the police chief on duty at the station, hear news of a revolt in Yeosu and the fall of Suncheon. They immediately flee Beolgyo with their men. Meanwhile, Yeom Sang-gu’s elder brother, Yeom Sang-jin—who had joined the South Korean Workers’ Party (the South Korean branch of the Workers’ Party of Korea, conducting underground activities in areas controlled by the Rhee Syngman regime)—leads a guerrilla unit under the command of the South Jeolla Provincial Party Committee, raising the North Korean flag and occupying Beolgyo without a fight.

    The real historical background of this story is the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident of October 1948. Anyone with some knowledge of modern Korean Peninsula history will be familiar with this event. It was the largest military rebellion to occur after the establishment of the Rhee Syngman regime, which governed the southern side of the 38th parallel, and it had major implications for the peninsula’s situation. Before the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident, the Rhee regime’s rule was relatively stable, and Kim Il-sung had not yet decided to invade the South. But after the incident, Kim Il-sung perceived conflict within Rhee’s government and widespread social unrest, and consequently decided to march south to unify the peninsula.

    Indeed, the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident was a concentrated reflection of the unstable military morale, fragmented public sentiment, and social turbulence in the southern half of the peninsula (for convenience, hereafter abbreviated as “South Korea,” even though some events occurred before the formal founding of the Republic of Korea). The immediate trigger for the incident was the refusal of certain Korean troops stationed in Yeosu to suppress the civilian uprising in Jeju. And the cause of the Jeju uprising itself was the military and police suppression of demonstrators. Both the Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion and the Jeju uprising were supported and encouraged by the South Korean Workers’ Party.

    The fundamental reason the South Korean Workers’ Party was able to successfully incite revolt was the severe social contradictions in South Korea and the authoritarian and arbitrary rule of the Rhee Syngman regime (these two points will be discussed in later sections). 

Meanwhile, the left-wing forces advocating the establishment of a “communist paradise,” along with the seemingly energetic northern half of the peninsula, held considerable appeal for soldiers and civilians in the South—who were bewildered by chaos and suffered from injustice and exploitation under Rhee. As a result, a series of military and civilian uprisings erupted, with the Yeosu–Suncheon Incident being the largest military revolt among them.

    Returning to the film to trace clues: after Yeom Sang-jin’s guerrillas occupy Beolgyo, they enthusiastically contact other rebel forces while immediately launching a purge, subjecting local landlords, bureaucrats, military and police officers, and other anti-communist and pro-government figures to denunciations and executions. Except for Kim Sa-yong, the father of the protagonist Kim Beom-u (played by Ahn Sung-ki), who is spared because he once taught Yeom Sang-jin and helped support his schooling, all other landlords and pro-government anti-communist individuals who failed to flee are killed—over 100 people in total. For a single “eup,” this amounted to a brutal massacre.

    But within less than three days, government forces defeated the rebels holding Suncheon, and the Beolgyo guerrillas were forced to flee hastily—killing civilians perceived as hostile to the left before their retreat. When government troops, police, and militias returned to Beolgyo, they quickly launched retaliatory operations, slaughtering relatives of guerrillas and informants who had cooperated with them. Later, during a series of government military and police purges, many individuals accused of having had secret contact with guerrillas were also killed. At night, the left-wing guerrillas struck back in turn, raiding towns, executing informants, forcibly conscripting young men, and seizing cattle and grain.

    Such cruel cycles of mutual slaughter and retaliation were occurring throughout the peninsula from 1945 to the 1950s. On the surface, these killings stemmed from conflict between two regimes (the Kim Il-sung regime and the Rhee Syngman regime) and two ideologies (communism and feudal capitalism). But the more immediate cause lay in unequal distribution of wealth—especially land—which drove survival-based violence and created vicious cycles of hatred and retaliation.

The Land Issue: The Focal Point of Political Struggles and Ideological Confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, and the Root of Life-and-Death Struggles Among the People

  The land issue on the Korean Peninsula can be traced back to the feudal period of Joseon (here the term “feudal” follows Marxist historiography and related translations, same below). The feudal dynasty of Joseon, similar to China’s ancient dynasties, was also built upon the rule of the landlord class, and the dynasty primarily represented the interests of that class. However, compared with China, the feudal dynasty and entire traditional society of Joseon had an even more rigid structure. 

Joseon’s traditional culture, which inherited and modified Confucian culture from China, became more conservative and more strictly bound by ethical norms and hierarchical propriety. As a result, social classes became even more sharply divided. In ancient Joseon, the “yangban,” composed of aristocrats, officials, scholars, and military officers, were the privileged class of the nation and the ethnicity. They enjoyed far higher status and wealth than commoners, maintained hereditary succession, intermarried among themselves, and formed tightly knit cliques. The most important resource that demonstrated and secured their wealth and status was land.

    The yangban aristocracy controlled most of the land on the Korean Peninsula, but naturally did not cultivate it themselves. They hired tenant farmers to work the land, and these tenants gradually became servants attached to them. Although the peninsula’s tenant farmers were not officially labeled “serfs” like Russian peasants, the degree of oppression they suffered—especially their loss of personal freedom—was in some respects even worse than Russia’s “serfs,” and harsher than what Chinese peasants experienced. This was related to Joseon’s relatively stricter institutional and cultural system, as well as the peninsula’s limited land, dense population, low per-capita farmland, heavy farming pressure, and the lack of any real room for peasants to migrate.

    The yangban aristocrats lived lives of comfort or even indulgence, while peasants survived by cutting expenses and living on the brink of hardship. Whether peasants could live slightly better, or even simply have enough to eat, often depended on the personality or momentary mood of their yangban masters. Therefore, the conflict of interest between the aristocracy and the peasants was extremely severe, and society was highly stratified. Yet due to Joseon’s deep mastery of Confucian traditions and institutional structures adopted from China, the ruling class of Joseon succeeded in maintaining long-term stability. Even in rare instances of dynastic change (far fewer than in China), these were merely changes of power among the elite, with very few peasant revolts.

    Furthermore, although the yangban were extravagant, they also served as the backbone of the Joseon dynasty (and other local regimes on the peninsula), bearing responsibilities such as governing the state, maintaining order, developing the economy, promoting education and culture, undertaking construction projects, and defending against foreign invaders. They were the central force that enabled Goryeo/Joseon civilization to survive and flourish for centuries. It was precisely because they were supported by the peasants that they could escape the hardships of subsistence agriculture, avoid being burdened by farming labor, and instead concentrate on fulfilling their responsibilities.

    Most importantly, the Korean Peninsula is small in area and historically suffered repeated invasions—from Japan in the east, from Chinese dynasties in the west, and from nomadic or hunter-gatherer tribes in the north. Thus, internal unity was necessary to resist external aggression, which to some extent alleviated internal contradictions. In resisting foreign invasions, the yangban played a central role, and peasants could only unite and form military strength under yangban leadership. Under the monarch’s command, the two classes cooperated and enabled the relatively weak Joseon to withstand external threats and preserve statehood and civilization.

    However, this did not mean class contradictions did not exist. On the contrary, long-term oppression resulted in increasing class rigidity and intensifying class antagonism, with resentment accumulating over time. With the opening of the country in the 19th century and the influence of modern civilization, as well as the various impacts of Japanese colonial rule (which created a crisis of national survival while also weakening the rule of the Joseon aristocracy), the yangban system, along with the entire traditional social structure, faced fierce challenges. The Donghak Peasant Revolution, which occurred shortly before the First Sino-Japanese War, was a violent uprising of the Korean peasantry against internal and external oppression.

    After the peninsula became a full colony of Japan in the early 20th century, neither the Japanese colonizers nor Korean right-wing anti-Japanese nationalists and modernizers such as Syngman Rhee advocated thoroughly destroying the old system or the yangban aristocracy, nor did they intend to change land distribution or the broader relations of production. Instead, they actively sought to win over and utilize the old elite.

    For example, while Japanese colonial authorities killed, exiled, or expelled anti-Japanese yangban, they also supported and employed pro-Japanese yangban, transferring the land of the former to the latter. Korean peasants thus suffered dual oppression—from Japanese colonizers and from pro-Japanese yangban aristocrats. And right-wing nationalists represented by Syngman Rhee placed national liberation from Japan above all else, but had no intention of liberating the peasants. Instead, they likewise sought to win over yangban and other landlords and capitalists (after coming to power, the Rhee regime even harmed peasant interests to please the landlord class, which will be discussed later).

    The only forces that firmly advocated completely abolishing yangban privileges, dismantling the traditional social structure, granting peasants and other oppressed groups full citizenship, and equal distribution of wealth were the emerging groups of Korean socialists/communists. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, socialists in Korea were extremely marginalized and merely one branch within the broader nationalist movement. Moreover, due to the peninsula’s small population and limited social and cultural infrastructure, most Korean socialists operated in China, Japan, or Russia, with many holding foreign citizenship rather than Korean citizenship.

    After the victory of the Russian October Revolution and the establishment and rise of the Chinese Communist Party, many Korean socialists in Russia and China joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the CCP. Compared with right-wing nationalists like Syngman Rhee—who were also active abroad but maintained closer ties with anti-colonial movements inside the peninsula (Rhee and others were active mainly in the United States, Western Europe, and Kuomintang-controlled China)—the left-wing socialists remained relatively marginal both abroad and within Korea. For example, the March First Movement—marking the beginning of modern independence struggles on the peninsula—though influenced by the ideology of national self-determination and liberation, was led by traditional landlord elites (yangban) and emergent bourgeois figures (the peasants who joined were merely followers under their landlords’ orders). Its goals were national independence, not socialism or communism.

    Even so, some anti-imperialist and anti-colonial socialists remained active on the peninsula, the most prominent being Pak Hon-yong, who later became the actual leader of the South Korean Workers’ Party. Among the core figures of the later North Korean regime, Pak Hon-yong was the only one who had been long active on the peninsula during the colonial period (others such as Kim Il-sung, Kim Chwae-hyŏk, and Heo Ga-i were mainly active abroad in China or the Soviet Union). The “provincial party,” “county party,” and guerrilla forces mentioned in the film all belonged to the South Korean Workers’ Party established by Pak Hon-yong. It was through the persistent struggle of Pak Hon-yong and others on the peninsula—including enduring imprisonment and torture—that socialist ideology and related movements took root among grassroots populations, forming the foundation for both the establishment of the North Korean regime and the left-wing resistance under the South Korean Rhee government.

    The main promise made by Pak Hon-yong and other socialist/communist activists to mobilize peasants for revolution was the redistribution of land—confiscating all land from the landlord class without compensation and dividing it among peasants, realizing “land to the tiller” and equal prosperity. Of course, they also preached communist ideology to peasants, denouncing the evils of feudal Confucian norms and the injustice of hierarchical systems, and claiming they would establish an earthly paradise of equality. 

Although these ideas contradicted the education instilled in peninsula residents for thousands of years, they nevertheless resonated with many long-oppressed peasants, especially poor tenant farmers. Meanwhile, some intellectuals from relatively affluent or even aristocratic backgrounds were drawn to left-wing ideals out of pure idealism and joined the revolutionary cause at the risk of their lives.

    The left-wing guerrilla forces in the film are precisely those directed and commanded by the South Korean Workers’ Party. In their internal review after retreating from Beolgyo, when Ahn Chang-min, an intellectual, criticized the party’s mistakes, Yeom Sang-jin fiercely demanded that he stop criticizing the party, because “the Party is always sacred and wise; all criticism of the Party is wrong.” This clearly reveals the Party’s strict control over revolutionaries and the severity of party discipline. It also shows that the communist forces in Korea at that time had already developed strong tendencies toward dogmatism and extremism.

    The background composition of the guerrilla core members reflected the typical makeup of participants in the left-wing movement on the peninsula. Yeom Sang-jin was born into a poor farming family, entered the teachers’ college through his diligence, came into contact with left-wing thought, and—combined with his personal and family suffering—became awakened and turned into a revolutionary. 

Ahn Chang-min represented upper-class intellectuals who leaned left; he devoted himself to the left-wing revolution purely for ideals, not personal gain, even betraying his own class background for those ideals. Another figure, Jeong Ha-seop (the guerrilla messenger who gradually develops feelings for the shaman Sohwa), came from a landlord family and, driven by idealism, also became a “progressive youth” who rebelled against his class. But he was younger than Ahn Chang-min and even more passionate and pure in his revolutionary zeal.

    Most other guerrillas were from poor peasant backgrounds. Many joined simply to obtain land or because they could no longer endure landlords’ oppression. For example, the tenant farmers who killed a landlord surnamed So—who had tried to sell land to avoid redistribution—and then defected to the guerrillas, were typical. Many others were forcibly conscripted or semi-forcibly coerced into joining, entering the “revolution” in a confused state.

    Professional revolutionaries as leaders, intellectuals as the backbone, and peasants as the main body—this was the basic composition of the left-wing forces on the Korean Peninsula (the same was true in other agricultural countries such as China and India). Intellectuals joined for the ideal of universal equality, peasants joined to gain their own land, and all aspired to a distant yet beautiful “communist paradise.”

    The rise of left-wing forces advocating land revolution naturally provoked fear among the traditional landlord class. Whether pro-Japanese yangban or nationalist landlords, capitalists, and intellectuals, all intensely hated communist forces. The Japanese colonial authorities violently suppressed left-wing movements—Pak Hon-yong was repeatedly arrested and tortured, once nearly driven insane, and later released and escaped to China only through extensive rescue efforts. Right-wing nationalists led by Syngman Rhee likewise refused to cooperate with the left (and certainly not with communists like Pak Hon-yong or Kim Il-sung), viewing one another as enemies.

    The confrontation and conflict between the left and right, between aristocrats and commoners, and between landlords and tenant farmers continued from the colonial era into the post-liberation period, and became even more violent due to the division of the peninsula—resulting in massive massacres and warfare.",an epic of modern korean history the taebaek mountains ordeals and lamentations

in korean film history the publication of the complete version of the novel as well as the production and release of the film all took place several years after korea s democratization in for this reason the film also reflects the social sentiments of the time when the right wing military dictatorship had ended pluralistic democratic politics was beginning to take shape and korean society especially the intellectual community was reexamining history calling for humanitarianism and experiencing the rise of center left ideologies yet what the film reflects goes far beyond these aspects it carries even richer and more complex meanings and values to explore these one must examine and analyze the detailed content of the novel and the film one by one the repeated changes of flags in beolgyo eup south jeolla province beginning with the yeosu suncheon incident at the beginning of the film subtitles explain the historical background of the taebaek mountains the u s soviet cold war and ideological confrontation led to the division and conflict of the korean peninsula the melancholy opening theme and the scene of a flock of geese circling above the taebaek mountains foreshadow the tragic nature of this story the film opens with the ringing of telephones in the police station and the youth corps breaking the nighttime quiet of beolgyo yeom sang gu the inspector general of the youth corps who is playing cards and nam in tae the police chief on duty at the station hear news of a revolt in yeosu and the fall of suncheon they immediately flee beolgyo with their men meanwhile yeom sang gu s elder brother yeom sang jin who had joined the south korean workers party the south korean branch of the workers party of korea conducting underground activities in areas controlled by the rhee syngman regime leads a guerrilla unit under the command of the south jeolla provincial party committee raising the north korean flag and occupying beolgyo without a fight the real historical background of this story is the yeosu suncheon incident of october anyone with some knowledge of modern korean peninsula history will be familiar with this event it was the largest military rebellion to occur after the establishment of the rhee syngman regime which governed the southern side of the th parallel and it had major implications for the peninsula s situation before the yeosu suncheon incident the rhee regime s rule was relatively stable and kim il sung had not yet decided to invade the south but after the incident kim il sung perceived conflict within rhee s government and widespread social unrest and consequently decided to march south to unify the peninsula indeed the yeosu suncheon incident was a concentrated reflection of the unstable military morale fragmented public sentiment and social turbulence in the southern half of the peninsula for convenience hereafter abbreviated as south korea even though some events occurred before the formal founding of the republic of korea the immediate trigger for the incident was the refusal of certain korean troops stationed in yeosu to suppress the civilian uprising in jeju and the cause of the jeju uprising itself was the military and police suppression of demonstrators both the yeosu suncheon rebellion and the jeju uprising were supported and encouraged by the south korean workers party the fundamental reason the south korean workers party was able to successfully incite revolt was the severe social contradictions in south korea and the authoritarian and arbitrary rule of the rhee syngman regime these two points will be discussed in later sections meanwhile the left wing forces advocating the establishment of a communist paradise along with the seemingly energetic northern half of the peninsula held considerable appeal for soldiers and civilians in the south who were bewildered by chaos and suffered from injustice and exploitation under rhee as a result a series of military and civilian uprisings erupted with the yeosu suncheon incident being the largest military revolt among them returning to the film to trace clues after yeom sang jin s guerrillas occupy beolgyo they enthusiastically contact other rebel forces while immediately launching a purge subjecting local landlords bureaucrats military and police officers and other anti communist and pro government figures to denunciations and executions except for kim sa yong the father of the protagonist kim beom u played by ahn sung ki who is spared because he once taught yeom sang jin and helped support his schooling all other landlords and pro government anti communist individuals who failed to flee are killed over people in total for a single eup this amounted to a brutal massacre but within less than three days government forces defeated the rebels holding suncheon and the beolgyo guerrillas were forced to flee hastily killing civilians perceived as hostile to the left before their retreat when government troops police and militias returned to beolgyo they quickly launched retaliatory operations slaughtering relatives of guerrillas and informants who had cooperated with them later during a series of government military and police purges many individuals accused of having had secret contact with guerrillas were also killed at night the left wing guerrillas struck back in turn raiding towns executing informants forcibly conscripting young men and seizing cattle and grain such cruel cycles of mutual slaughter and retaliation were occurring throughout the peninsula from to the s on the surface these killings stemmed from conflict between two regimes the kim il sung regime and the rhee syngman regime and two ideologies communism and feudal capitalism but the more immediate cause lay in unequal distribution of wealth especially land which drove survival based violence and created vicious cycles of hatred and retaliation the land issue the focal point of political struggles and

(On the history of leftist revolutions, national history, injustice and the suffering of vulnerable groups, the historical connections between the mainland and Hong Kong, the distortion and misuse of socialism/communism, populism, June Fourth, the pursuit of democracy, the transformations of Chinese liberals, the future of the mainland and Hong Kong, and personal reflections and expectations)


Respected Mr. Leung Kwok-hung:

I am Wang Qingmin, a writer living in Europe. During my middle school years, I already heard your name and learned about your deeds through media, newspapers, and the internet. Whether it was your struggle for the rights of the hardworking laborers and the suffering underclass, your more than thirty years of persistence in calling for the vindication of June Fourth and accountability for Beijing’s massacre, your outcry for justice for the Chinese people killed by Japanese invaders in the Nanjing Massacre, your fundraising for disaster relief for the people of Sichuan during the Wenchuan Earthquake, or your support for many political prisoners and resisters in mainland China, your sense of justice, courage, and action have always earned my deepest admiration. I have long wished to meet you, but unfortunately have never had the opportunity.

Five years ago, when I went to Hong Kong for some personal matters and political appeals, I once went to the League of Social Democrats in hopes of visiting you, but I did not find you there. A few days later, when I went to the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government to “scout the site” in preparation for a protest, I happened to see you and other comrades of the League of Social Democrats engaged in protest. But at that time many journalists and police surrounded you, and you left quickly. I also worried about disrupting your protest and the media’s interviews, so I could not speak with you, and in the end only watched you leave.

Later, after experiencing various things and traveling through many places, I left mainland China and came to Europe. Before I had even fully settled down, I heard about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Movement that had erupted in Hong Kong. In just over a year, Hong Kong’s political opposition was wiped out, and civil society was completely destroyed. And you, too, were imprisoned. This was something I had never expected.

In these years, whether in the unexpected twists and changes of my own life, or in the shifting circumstances I have seen and heard in mainland China, Hong Kong, and the world, I have come to understand fully the impermanence of life and of worldly affairs.

Yet in this ever-changing world, what is needed even more is sincere perseverance. And you are exactly such an exemplar, one who for decades has upheld ideals, abided by conscience, and defended justice. I have read about your life and many of your deeds, and I know that from the British colonial era you were already committed to the socialist movement, loving your country and your people, and serving as a vanguard of Hong Kong’s leftist revolution. The “Revolutionary Marxist League” in which you participated was one of the very few Hong Kong political organizations of that era that clearly opposed colonialism, capitalism, and conservatism.

After the 1967 Uprising (the 1967 Riots—which, in fact, we should more properly call an uprising; although the uprising was exploited and harmed some innocent people—this indeed requires apology and repentance—it was still, on the whole, a revolutionary struggle against colonialism and corruption, in pursuit of justice) was suppressed, Hong Kong’s leftist movement fell into long dormancy. Yet you, unafraid of the high-pressure authoritarianism of the British colonial authorities and of the Chinese Communist regime that colluded with them, still held fast to your ideals, even moving against the tide—speaking up and fighting for laborers, women, and the underclass, nearly single-handedly carving out in Hong Kong a new path of “continuing revolution” that was both radical and yet peaceful and sustainable. Whether denouncing the dictatorship of the CCP, or criticizing the Hong Kong establishment (especially the Liberal Party and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong) for disregarding the rights and interests of the common people, you always spoke with reason and power, forcing them to make some concessions, giving up part of their vested interests in order to placate laborers and the underclass.

It is precisely because of your presence that Hong Kong’s workers and underclass people have had support and hope, allowing this city—steeped in the stench of brutal capitalism and marked by vast disparities between rich and poor—to still let shine, through its cracks, the rays of social justice and the light of equality and fraternity.

Even more worthy of admiration is that you are not one of those reverse nationalists who abandon the nation and the people for leftist revolution and internationalism. On the contrary, your ardent and sincere patriotism far surpasses that of the overwhelming majority of mainland and Hong Kong politicians and intellectuals. Whether in the Diaoyu Islands protection movement, in denouncing the Nanjing Massacre, in pursuing accountability for Japan’s war crimes and forced labor, in criticizing the crimes of Western imperial powers, or in exposing the evil deeds of the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong and their discrimination and oppression of Hong Kong people, you have always been passionate and sincere, never wavering over decades. Your sense of justice, your courage, and your national spirit make me, like a small blade of grass in the mountains, look up to the sunrise in the east, receiving lessons for the soul and strength in justice.

The Sino-British negotiations and Hong Kong’s return were supposed to be another stage victory of the national democratic revolution. But the motherland to which Hong Kong returned was not truly a national democratic state, but rather one that was authoritarian and dictatorial, marked by brutal capitalism, collusion with conservative and reactionary forces of various countries. This was not only the case in Deng Xiaoping’s era—it had already been so in Mao Zedong’s era. Whether it was Mao’s “thanks to Japan’s invasion,” his meeting with Nixon, or his kindness to Pinochet and other Latin American right-wing military dictators burdened with blood debts, the CCP had long since betrayed the nation and the people, and abandoned the ideals of revolution. Deng Xiaoping’s era not only continued this, but went further in launching the Tiananmen Massacre, crushing the Chinese nation’s century-long democratic dream.

After Hong Kong’s return, apart from hypocritically awarding a few small honors to certain people from the 1967 Uprising as consolation, the CCP completely tilted toward the powerful and the capitalists. The CCP and the Hong Kong government were in fact even more pro-power and pro-business than the British colonial government. The living conditions of laborers and the underclass did not see systemic improvement; Hong Kong remained a paradise of neoliberalism and a filthy marketplace for deals among global elites. While Hong Kong laborers and maids curled up in “coffin homes,” the likes of Jasper Tsang feasted and toasted in “Banquet House.” And the straight-line distance between the two may not have been more than 500 meters.

In dealing with Japan’s invasion and the crimes of Western colonialism, the CCP on the one hand exploited these to rally and buy off the hearts of the people, resisting the infiltration of the West and universal values, but on the other hand suppressed genuine reflection, criticism, and accountability regarding Japan’s crimes and imperialist colonialism—using false nationalism to stifle true nationalism, constructing the “Chinese Nation” as a replacement to blur and dilute the real and powerful cohesion, unity, and emotion of the Han nation, in order to control the Han people and, along with them, all the other peoples of the country. In foreign relations, whether toward Japan, Britain, the U.S., or the imperialist powers, the CCP has always belittled them in words but courted them in reality, seeking their favor and exchanging it for their support of CCP rule in China, willingly acting as the “territorial guard” for foreign powers. Meanwhile, the people of Hong Kong and mainland China, especially the mainlanders, have suffered the dual exploitation of the CCP elites and foreign colonizers, directly and indirectly. Whether the “Friendship Stores” of the Mao era or the “sweatshops” of the Deng era, both reflected that the nature of the “semi-colonial and semi-feudal society” had not changed.

In 2018, the Jasic workers’ struggle in Shenzhen was one of the very few large-scale collective resistances in China since June Fourth, and also the peak of China’s labor movement, demonstrating the courage of the Chinese working class and the solidarity of workers and students. But the Jasic workers’ movement was ultimately brutally suppressed by the CCP regime, with many workers and young students arrested, and dissemination both offline and online prohibited. This once again exposed the reactionary essence of the CCP regime as one belonging to a privileged bourgeoisie.

In the Huawei Meng Wanzhou incident, the CCP did not hesitate to take foreigners hostage, destroying Sino-Canadian/Sino-American relations to save this “princeling,” yet turned a blind eye to the arrests of Hong Kong youths Kwok Siu-kit and Yim Man-wah, who protested at Japan’s Yasukuni Shrine. This once again proved in fact that the CCP regime is one that only defends the interests of its privileged class, disregarding national interests and the rights of ordinary citizens—an “internal colonial” regime. (And at the time of the Meng Wanzhou incident, when a Huawei executive was arrested in Poland, both Huawei and the Chinese government quickly “cut ties” with him, which likewise reflected this discriminatory double standard of the CCP.)

Such a “motherland”—is it still possible to love? Although the regime and the people are two different things, one has to admit that at least among China’s vested-interest class, those with discourse power, and highly educated middle-aged and young men in China, whether supporters of the CCP establishment or anti-CCP opposition, whether nominally leftist or rightist, most are in fact either social Darwinists, reverse nationalists, or false nationalists—or even a combination of these (including some of those whom you once supported and helped, and for whom you once raised your voice in front of the Liaison Office). They are no different from, or are simply the mirror image of, what the CCP openly advocates or tacitly encourages. With such a state and such citizens, it is truly difficult to “love.”

And Hong Kong, in recent years, has also become increasingly “mainlandized.” The Hong Kong establishment is highly bound together with the CCP’s privileged class, and the suppression and erosion of Hong Kong people’s freedoms grows heavier by the day. Compared with the British colonial government, which at least spoke somewhat of modern capitalist humanitarianism (though in essence hypocritical, limited, and aimed at maintaining bourgeois and colonial rule), the CCP practices survival-of-the-fittest social Darwinism, using “patriotism” as a fig leaf while lacking genuine patriotism, with hypocrisy and shamelessness surpassing even that of the British colonial authorities. As for the promised pursuit of building a “new democratic society” and a “communist society,” those ideals were long since thrown to the winds.

Yet in such a country and city, under such an ideology and reality, you have nevertheless remained unchanged for decades, holding to the revolutionary beginning and ideals, unceasingly fighting for social justice. In the Legislative Council, before the Liaison Office, in Central, in Victoria Park, you have time and again fiercely denounced the ugly deeds of those arrogant scoundrels, with unrestrained power; you have spoken for laborers and women, supported political prisoners and rights defenders in the mainland, with sincerity and strength; for decades you have tirelessly rushed about, navigating among various powerful forces and complex gray networks of interests, striving to win discourse power and legitimate benefits for those who cannot speak or resist, step by step, grounded and practical.

You have also endured prison many times for your resistance. When I was detained in a police station and placed in a mental hospital in Hong Kong due to protest activities and self-harm, I could hardly endure even just a few hours in the sweltering environment of the Western District Police Station detention cell. It was difficult even to softly hum the “Internationale.” With that experience, I can even more profoundly understand and admire your resilience, bravery, and greatness.

For your words, deeds, and spiritual qualities, there are no words left to describe in further praise—everything has already been said, and no more can be added.

After the Anti-Extradition Movement and the crackdown of 2019–2020, the CCP regime completely tore up the contract of “Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong, with a high degree of autonomy,” abandoned the promise of “fifty years unchanged,” and took the opportunity to completely crush the political opposition and indeed all of Hong Kong’s civil society. Not only was violent resistance suppressed, but even resistance through peaceful means such as parliament and demonstrations was no longer permitted. This reveals the utter madness of Xi’s CCP, and also reflects the cruel, dark, and suffocating reality of today’s Hong Kong and all of China.

And it is not only China—the entire global situation makes one feel uneasy, even pessimistic and pained. The progressive waves that once swept the world—whether Roosevelt’s New Deal, the movements of 1968, the Carnation Revolution and the third wave of democratization, the rise of the Latin American left, the Arab Spring… all have passed and receded (though with some partial returns, such as Lula defeating Bolsonaro in Brazil). Today’s world is one of rampant right-wing conservative populism—from America’s reactionary forces of Trump-Pence-Pompeo-DeSantis, to India’s Modi, Hungary’s Orbán, Russia’s Putin, and even Japan’s Shinzo Abe and Fumio Kishida—regimes are undermining world peace and progress, and oppressed, vulnerable nations and peoples suffer even more.

In Hong Kong too, there emerged a strong localist populist force, which split the pan-democratic camp, intensified conflicts between the mainland and Hong Kong, and together with Xi’s regime broke the tacit understandings between the CCP and Hong Kong’s non-establishment, leading to a series of violent conflicts during the Anti-Extradition Movement. Of course, they should not be overly blamed—the CCP was the greatest culprit. But Hong Kong’s localists and the “brave fighters,” though their actions can be understood and sympathized with, were ultimately narrow and shortsighted, unlikely to achieve Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy, and deviating from universal justice. I respect them, but I also hope even more that they will in the end stand on the same front as Hong Kong’s pan-democrats and the oppressed people of mainland China.

Even more tragic is that the laboring class—which once represented the vanguard of advanced productive forces and new civilization—has undergone a split, with part of it becoming instead an important component of right-wing conservative populist forces. On the one hand, they strive for their own rights and benefits, but on the other hand they oppose women’s rights, LGBT rights, the rights of minorities and other vulnerable groups, even opposing workers in other countries gaining benefits, and engaging in competition and harm among workers themselves, while believing in various conspiracy theories and hate-inciting propaganda, becoming narrow, anti-intellectual, and blindly obedient. Although not all laborers are like this, at least a considerable portion of workers (whether in the West or in the Third World) have indeed degenerated.

In fact, the working class has always had a dual or even multiple nature. On the one hand, workers are the core of productive forces, the backbone of production relations, the main force of human industrialization, modernization, and civilization. Without workers, there would be no prosperous and great world today. On the other hand, the working class also has selfishness, ignorance, and narrowness. In China, the “worker aristocrats” of state-owned enterprises in the Mao era had already degenerated into an exploiting class and rent-seekers, whose value creation fell far short of their income, and who became a conservative and stubborn force obstructing reform. As for the lower and middle workers, their labor and contributions deserve respect, sympathy, and support, but at least a considerable portion of them are misogynistic, hostile to the weak (even though they themselves are weak), exclusionary of the different, cruel and violent, anti-intellectual and superstitious. Even though these problems are fundamentally the result of oppression, brainwashing, and manipulation by the ruling class, they must still bear part of the blame themselves.

Even in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the working class had these problems, but compared with feudal conservative forces and the primitive barbaric bourgeoisie, the conservatism and narrowness of workers were not so prominent. At that time, they even converged with progressive currents such as feminism, and throughout most of the 20th century they were part of the progressive forces, standing together with feminists, the disabled, minorities, and others. But after a century, with the development of the times and the reshuffling of forces, at least part of the laborers have instead regressed to a level of reaction comparable to the workers of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan under the Emperor and the military. When Brazilian truck drivers abandoned the Workers’ Party and instead fervently supported the far-right fascist Bolsonaro, calling for the return of military dictatorship, this most clearly revealed such a tragic degeneration.

Yet this degeneration is not entirely incomprehensible. Various forms of exploitation, oppression, deception, and violence place workers in pain and confusion, deprive them of good education, and leave them incapable of proper understanding and judgment, making them easily incited and exploited. Although compared with the previous two centuries, workers’ material conditions have greatly improved, still “it is not poverty but inequality that is feared; not scarcity but insecurity that is resented.” The widening domestic gaps between rich and poor in various countries, and the imbalances of economic and political development internationally, all harm workers’ dignity and interests. With industrial transformation and the development of artificial intelligence, with the proliferation of “rust belt states,” the traditional industrial working class is more anxious and lost than in the materially scarce past, naturally prone to be drawn to extreme ideologies.

And the political and economic elites and mainstream intellectuals have not sufficiently recognized and cared about the plight and suffering of workers—indeed, compared with the past, their attention has clearly receded. Today’s leftist forces, especially elite leftists, lean more toward feminism, sexual minorities, environmentalism, and other more “fashionable” and “champagne” issues (of course, these issues are not truly “champagne-like” or superficial, but indeed very real and important issues—yet they have distracted attention away from workers’ rights issues). The neglect and even abandonment by the elite class have deepened workers’ discontent and sense of rejection, making them turn toward conservative forces to gain real benefits and seek psychological security and belonging—and this, too, is understandable.

But understanding is one thing—the populism, conservatism, and narrowness of the workers are, whether for their own long-term interests or for world peace and progress, gravely harmful.

In short, today’s world is full of countercurrents, with conflicts breaking out repeatedly, and different social identities splitting and opposing one another. Compared with decades ago, the world is not more unified, but more torn apart. The “Chinese model” of totalitarianism, Russian expansionism, Indian and Japanese conservative nationalist populism, and Western right-wing hegemonism together fill this world with ugliness, with the weak insulted and devoured, and humanity’s future shrouded in obscurity. The entirely unjust Russia-Ukraine war of the past year has further shown the world blood, corpses, ruined families—the fragility of civilization.

In such a chaotic and extreme era, there are not only no longer “prophets armed to the teeth” to sweep away evil and remake the human world, but not even “disarmed prophets” or “exiled prophets.” The once somewhat influential Peng Shuzhi and Wang Fanxi have long since passed away, and as for Trotskyists of Chen Duxiu’s kind—with outstanding character, abundant talent, and democratic convictions—they are nowhere to be found. The Fourth International, apart from being active in a few countries, has overall become a ceremonial, symbolic organization, lacking both the strength and the will to push the world toward continuous revolution and renewal.

What is the way forward for the future of Hong Kong, mainland China, and the entire world? Ten years ago there were still blueprints and hopes, but in recent years things have instead become increasingly muddled and unclear.


Yet, the light of hope still exists, and it exists precisely in you and other righteous men and women who are now suffering misfortune, in your like-minded younger comrades, and in the peoples all over the world who love freedom and democracy and pursue fairness and justice. The “White Paper Revolution” that broke out across China at the end of last year reflected that even under the high pressure of totalitarianism, many people, including young workers and students, still bravely fought against tyranny and raised the shocking voice of a new generation.

And according to various sources, many of the fighters in the “White Paper Revolution” were directly or indirectly influenced by the ideas of freedom, democracy, and justice that arose and spread from Hong Kong, which helped renew their values and inspired real action. Since the CCP took control of mainland China and carried out a series of crackdowns, massacres, and literary inquisitions, the mainland people generally lost their backbone, their spines broken, their morality corroded. It was Hong Kong—more precisely, Hong Kong’s patriotic democrats—that rejoined the broken bones of the Chinese people, restored the broken spine, and carried on the spirit of Chinese civilization.

And you are the hardest rib among Hong Kong’s people, together with Szeto Wah, Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho Chun-yan, and Koo Sze-yiu, supporting the unbending backbone of Hong Kong, carrying forward and amplifying the brave national spirit of self-strengthening. When in mainland China, from officials to commoners, all bowed slavishly to the strong and trampled the weak at will, mouths full of lies, betraying trust everywhere, silent for the public but noisy for themselves, immersed in material desires and petty strife, it was you and other Hong Kong righteous men who, selflessly public-minded, upright and courageous, spoke without fear, pleaded for the people, saying what mainlanders dared not say, doing what mainlanders dared not do, allowing the long-suffering and long-fallen Chinese nation still to retain in one corner of Victoria Harbour a conscience and courage, and enabling many victims to receive real help and warmth.

These things are remembered in the hearts of many mainland Chinese. Although many have been deceived, misled, and incited, not all mainlanders are brainwashed. Especially with regard to you—every mainlander who knows you, whatever their political stance, basically holds you in admiration. Toward other Hong Kong democrats, there are many misunderstandings and misreadings, but there are also those who are clear-sighted. What you have done for the mainland is worthwhile, and I here express my gratitude to you and all of Hong Kong’s patriotic democrats.

The post–Anti-Extradition crackdown and the “National Security Law” have sought to break the backbone that Hong Kong had carried on, to conquer the last soil of Han resistance. From the practical level, they have already succeeded. But human beings have not only bodies, but also spirit and soul. For the warriors, even when imprisoned or killed, their lofty aspirations do not change.

Although such words may seem like self-consolation, they are not merely self-consolation. In Chinese history and world history, violence and darkness have been frequent, and even longer-lasting than the light. In dark ages, people indeed find it hard to overcome barbaric and ruthless conquerors. But people can resist in various ways—including with the persistence of the spirit and the resistance of thought—accumulating strength and spreading civilization, awaiting the return of the light.

You have endured prison many times, and each time you have steadfastly survived, becoming even firmer and braver. This time will be no exception. Even though after release you will not have the same freedom as before, as long as life remains, anything is possible. Compared with the Jacobins perishing on the guillotine, the Paris Communards falling in cemeteries, the Trotskyists who perished in Russia’s civil war and Stalin’s purges, today still affords more possibilities for resistance and more room for maneuver.

Struggle and revolution are difficult; construction is even harder. More than two centuries of leftist revolutionary history, though it created many glories, also brought or worsened many disasters. From the ferocity of Soviet Russia to the ruthlessness of Red China, from the secret shadows of the Stasi east of the Berlin Wall to the brutality of the Kim dynasty north of the 38th Parallel, the “shining path” has been littered with vile atrocities. “Communism”—how many crimes have been committed in your name!

Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm exposed most clearly and plainly the truth of such regimes called communist but in reality “Big Brother” dictatorships. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” “Big Brother”/“Napoleon”—such predators always triumph in this negative selection, dominating hundreds of millions of subjects; while “Goldstein”/“Snowball,” no matter how brilliant their achievements, merely wove garments for “Big Brother,” and the military-political systems they built for the liberation and defense of the people became machines that harmed the people. Today the CCP’s big-data totalitarian system, with its wide reach and dense penetration, has far exceeded Orwell’s imagination. (But Orwell, even seeing and partly experiencing such things, still upheld socialist ideals, clearly declaring himself a democratic socialist, not the right-wing liberal that some Chinese liberals distort him into.)

If Marx and Trotsky could travel to the present, seeing the rise and fall and mutations of the red states, seeing commoners and the weak suffering more humiliation than under Tsarist Russia or the Republic of China, perhaps they would abandon many of their former claims and prefer instead Europe’s social democracy, the “revisionist” model? (Yet we cannot, because of the red disasters of the past, deny the greatness of the communist ideal and the value of permanent revolution. Peace and prosperity built on the humiliation and suffering of commoners, especially the underclass, are not worth keeping—better to rise and sacrifice, turning brocades into scorched earth.)

What should the future world be like? From the Confucius and Mozi of pre-Qin times, to Plato and Aristotle of Greece, from the East’s “investigation of things to acquire knowledge” to the West’s “encyclopedias,” from the radical violent revolution theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Trotsky, to the Social Democrats’ Gotha Program and the “Third Way/New Middle Path” that gradually rose in the 1990s—countless have pondered and summed up. And the vicissitudes of human history, the rise and fall of regimes one after another, all tell us, “Comrades, we must still strive.” What the forebears did was what they ought to have done; the road ahead still needs later generations to explore and think through.

You have experienced decades of turbulence and mortal struggle, and surely thought more deeply than I, a mere junior. I also hope you will reflect even more on the way forward for Hong Kong and the mainland, and the blueprint for the world.

Although, perhaps it is already too late? The crisis brought by global warming may make Hong Kong, in a few decades, highly uninhabitable, and in a century submerged. Mainland China and indeed most of the world will also be frequently harmed by the high heat, floods, and droughts of the climate crisis. This will be a challenge even harder to reverse and resist than politics.

Yet perhaps people will, before the climate crisis becomes utterly unmanageable, find ways to solve or mitigate it? Still, one should not be overly alarmist, but rather remain rational and calm, doing one’s best within the span of life, thinking and changing, rather than despairing and abandoning.

The retrogression of Xi’s regime in these years has made Chinese laborers “toil yet remain poor,” white-collar workers trapped in “996,” migrant workers bleeding and sweating daily, struggling a lifetime and still unable to finish paying off housing loans; Chinese peasants still impoverished, discriminated against, subjected to various violences; Chinese middle school students working from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. for six years, doing useless toil that consumes but produces nothing; Chinese women—girls and grown women alike—bullied, harassed, harmed, as commonplace as daily bread, never with full rights and dignity. Others such as the disabled, HIV and leprosy sufferers, prison inmates, are year-round discriminated against and abused, living worse than death… They are trapped in poverty, insecurity, and injury, unable to speak clearly or resist independently, and under constant humiliation from the state machine to street thugs, they have lost the most basic human dignity and even the slightest courage to resist.

At such a time, it is all the more necessary for some to speak for them, to express their indignation and demands, to help them summon courage, to restore dignity, to resist tyranny with them, to seek a way out, to promote change. “Permanent revolution” includes not only political revolution, but also economic revolution, and more importantly, social revolution. The people of mainland China are, outside of North Korea, the most deeply bound and oppressed in the world, and also the most in need of change and liberation. Their eyes gouged, ears sealed, mouths blocked, arms cut off, legs broken, brains washed—they need the just and peace-loving peoples of the world to see, hear, speak, and act for them, to assist them in seeing and hearing, to restore their speech, to reattach their limbs, to enlighten their thoughts, to awaken their consciences, so that they can gradually stand up again, become self-reliant, and turn into a force beneficial both to themselves and to others, to the public interest, and to world civilization.

You and many Hong Kong righteous men have spoken for the mainland people for decades, for which I am deeply grateful. And now the mainland people are still evidently unable to resist independently, still needing you and the younger ones you nurture to speak for the nation.

I also know that today in Hong Kong, aside from the establishment camp that are the CCP’s running dogs, most others are local populists, the traditional pan-democrats have waned, and the radical left is rarer than phoenix feathers. But this city, which once erupted in a series of revolutionary struggles, still has many deep and passionate fighters. The famous artist Anthony Wong Chau-sang has shown much interest in the Fourth International, and is also keen on critical realist literature and historiography. He has trained many younger ones—surely some will be willing to inherit his mantle and ideas?

I think you are the same. Although today most Hong Kongers with rebellious spirit are similar in stance to Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Yau Wai-ching, Tiffany Yuen Ka-wai, in their localist self-determination and Hong Kong city-state views, and scornful of leftism and Greater China-ism, surely not all are like that? Chow Hang-tung, Ms. Ho Kit-wan are representatives of newcomers who are progressive and concerned with mainland human rights. But they are indeed too few and marginalized.

I hope that after you are released, you can give more teachings to Hong Kong youths devoted to justice, telling them of the century-long or even centuries-long suffering of the mainland Chinese, their present plight and despair. I also hope you will tell them where Hong Kong people’s bloodline, culture, and values truly lie. Hong Kong youth may despise and distance themselves from mainlanders due to their low quality, distorted values, and ugly society. But isn’t the current situation of the mainland and its people one of “longing for clouds in a drought, longing for generals in national calamity,” crying out for rescue by an “international brigade”?

1.4 billion souls suffer in pain, numbness, and decay. There must be a modern Prometheus to bring hope to their hearts, to clear the homeland dark even in daylight. Whether in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or countries around the world, whoever can bring democracy, progress, and justice to China—all conscientious Chinese will be deeply grateful.

Of course, the realization of freedom and democracy in mainland China fundamentally requires the mainland people themselves to rise up. External support can only play a role if mainland people respond and cooperate, not if they treat it as “hostile foreign forces” and hate it. As for mainlanders’ attitude toward Hong Kong democrats, the changes in Hong Kong-mainland relations in past years have indeed given disappointing and even despairing answers. But it should not be so forever. For example, many mainlanders, after enduring the tortures of lockdowns and quarantines during three years of “Zero-Covid,” changed their view of the Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Movement from hostility to understanding, respect, and even support. And now, as Xi continues retrogression and popular resentment boils over, perhaps mainlanders will more and more understand Hong Kongers’ values, ideals, courage, and persistence, merging again and resisting tyranny together.

If, after all these sufferings, mainland Chinese still cannot awaken in years to come, still hating Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy forces, then such people neither deserve to be saved, nor can be saved.

In any case, I still hope you will not regret your original intention, but persist in your ideals and spirit of struggle, and pass them on to more people. I have been inspired and encouraged by you (and of course also by other role models such as Yue Fei, Lin Zhao, and Xu Zhiyong), and have persisted to this day. Of course, the persistence of a mere nobody like me adds little to the grand situation. But if tens of thousands of such nobodies are united as one, then the flag of freedom will surely rise again to the skies, the bell of liberty will once more ring. Without resistance, how can there be change? To support the weak and lift up the fallen, with no thought of turning back—this is not only the motto of the League of Social Democrats, but should also be the common creed of every son and daughter of China.

There are still many things to write and say, and I cannot finish them all. What I have written and felt above is already quite fragmentary. Perhaps there will be other opportunities to make contact in the future. I hope you will be released soon, and also wish you and your partner Ms. Chan peace and health.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1q2q9fo/a_letter_to_hong_kong_leftist_civil_rights_leader/,"A Letter to Hong Kong Leftist Civil Rights Leader Mr. Leung Kwok-hung(History of Mainland–Hong Kong leftist movements, plight of workers and the vulnerable, national destiny, and hopes for the future) 8 


(On the history of leftist revolutions, national history, injustice and the suffering of vulnerable groups, the historical connections between the mainland and Hong Kong, the distortion and misuse of socialism/communism, populism, June Fourth, the pursuit of democracy, the transformations of Chinese liberals, the future of the mainland and Hong Kong, and personal reflections and expectations)


Respected Mr. Leung Kwok-hung:

I am Wang Qingmin, a writer living in Europe. During my middle school years, I already heard your name and learned about your deeds through media, newspapers, and the internet. Whether it was your struggle for the rights of the hardworking laborers and the suffering underclass, your more than thirty years of persistence in calling for the vindication of June Fourth and accountability for Beijing’s massacre, your outcry for justice for the Chinese people killed by Japanese invaders in the Nanjing Massacre, your fundraising for disaster relief for the people of Sichuan during the Wenchuan Earthquake, or your support for many political prisoners and resisters in mainland China, your sense of justice, courage, and action have always earned my deepest admiration. I have long wished to meet you, but unfortunately have never had the opportunity.

Five years ago, when I went to Hong Kong for some personal matters and political appeals, I once went to the League of Social Democrats in hopes of visiting you, but I did not find you there. A few days later, when I went to the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government to “scout the site” in preparation for a protest, I happened to see you and other comrades of the League of Social Democrats engaged in protest. But at that time many journalists and police surrounded you, and you left quickly. I also worried about disrupting your protest and the media’s interviews, so I could not speak with you, and in the end only watched you leave.

Later, after experiencing various things and traveling through many places, I left mainland China and came to Europe. Before I had even fully settled down, I heard about the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Movement that had erupted in Hong Kong. In just over a year, Hong Kong’s political opposition was wiped out, and civil society was completely destroyed. And you, too, were imprisoned. This was something I had never expected.

In these years, whether in the unexpected twists and changes of my own life, or in the shifting circumstances I have seen and heard in mainland China, Hong Kong, and the world, I have come to understand fully the impermanence of life and of worldly affairs.

Yet in this ever-changing world, what is needed even more is sincere perseverance. And you are exactly such an exemplar, one who for decades has upheld ideals, abided by conscience, and defended justice. I have read about your life and many of your deeds, and I know that from the British colonial era you were already committed to the socialist movement, loving your country and your people, and serving as a vanguard of Hong Kong’s leftist revolution. The “Revolutionary Marxist League” in which you participated was one of the very few Hong Kong political organizations of that era that clearly opposed colonialism, capitalism, and conservatism.

After the 1967 Uprising (the 1967 Riots—which, in fact, we should more properly call an uprising; although the uprising was exploited and harmed some innocent people—this indeed requires apology and repentance—it was still, on the whole, a revolutionary struggle against colonialism and corruption, in pursuit of justice) was suppressed, Hong Kong’s leftist movement fell into long dormancy. Yet you, unafraid of the high-pressure authoritarianism of the British colonial authorities and of the Chinese Communist regime that colluded with them, still held fast to your ideals, even moving against the tide—speaking up and fighting for laborers, women, and the underclass, nearly single-handedly carving out in Hong Kong a new path of “continuing revolution” that was both radical and yet peaceful and sustainable. Whether denouncing the dictatorship of the CCP, or criticizing the Hong Kong establishment (especially the Liberal Party and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong) for disregarding the rights and interests of the common people, you always spoke with reason and power, forcing them to make some concessions, giving up part of their vested interests in order to placate laborers and the underclass.

It is precisely because of your presence that Hong Kong’s workers and underclass people have had support and hope, allowing this city—steeped in the stench of brutal capitalism and marked by vast disparities between rich and poor—to still let shine, through its cracks, the rays of social justice and the light of equality and fraternity.

Even more worthy of admiration is that you are not one of those reverse nationalists who abandon the nation and the people for leftist revolution and internationalism. On the contrary, your ardent and sincere patriotism far surpasses that of the overwhelming majority of mainland and Hong Kong politicians and intellectuals. Whether in the Diaoyu Islands protection movement, in denouncing the Nanjing Massacre, in pursuing accountability for Japan’s war crimes and forced labor, in criticizing the crimes of Western imperial powers, or in exposing the evil deeds of the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong and their discrimination and oppression of Hong Kong people, you have always been passionate and sincere, never wavering over decades. Your sense of justice, your courage, and your national spirit make me, like a small blade of grass in the mountains, look up to the sunrise in the east, receiving lessons for the soul and strength in justice.

The Sino-British negotiations and Hong Kong’s return were supposed to be another stage victory of the national democratic revolution. But the motherland to which Hong Kong returned was not truly a national democratic state, but rather one that was authoritarian and dictatorial, marked by brutal capitalism, collusion with conservative and reactionary forces of various countries. This was not only the case in Deng Xiaoping’s era—it had already been so in Mao Zedong’s era. Whether it was Mao’s “thanks to Japan’s invasion,” his meeting with Nixon, or his kindness to Pinochet and other Latin American right-wing military dictators burdened with blood debts, the CCP had long since betrayed the nation and the people, and abandoned the ideals of revolution. Deng Xiaoping’s era not only continued this, but went further in launching the Tiananmen Massacre, crushing the Chinese nation’s century-long democratic dream.

After Hong Kong’s return, apart from hypocritically awarding a few small honors to certain people from the 1967 Uprising as consolation, the CCP completely tilted toward the powerful and the capitalists. The CCP and the Hong Kong government were in fact even more pro-power and pro-business than the British colonial government. The living conditions of laborers and the underclass did not see systemic improvement; Hong Kong remained a paradise of neoliberalism and a filthy marketplace for deals among global elites. While Hong Kong laborers and maids curled up in “coffin homes,” the likes of Jasper Tsang feasted and toasted in “Banquet House.” And the straight-line distance between the two may not have been more than 500 meters.

In dealing with Japan’s invasion and the crimes of Western colonialism, the CCP on the one hand exploited these to rally and buy off the hearts of the people, resisting the infiltration of the West and universal values, but on the other hand suppressed genuine reflection, criticism, and accountability regarding Japan’s crimes and imperialist colonialism—using false nationalism to stifle true nationalism, constructing the “Chinese Nation” as a replacement to blur and dilute the real and powerful cohesion, unity, and emotion of the Han nation, in order to control the Han people and, along with them, all the other peoples of the country. In foreign relations, whether toward Japan, Britain, the U.S., or the imperialist powers, the CCP has always belittled them in words but courted them in reality, seeking their favor and exchanging it for their support of CCP rule in China, willingly acting as the “territorial guard” for foreign powers. Meanwhile, the people of Hong Kong and mainland China, especially the mainlanders, have suffered the dual exploitation of the CCP elites and foreign colonizers, directly and indirectly. Whether the “Friendship Stores” of the Mao era or the “sweatshops” of the Deng era, both reflected that the nature of the “semi-colonial and semi-feudal society” had not changed.

In 2018, the Jasic workers’ struggle in Shenzhen was one of the very few large-scale collective resistances in China since June Fourth, and also the peak of China’s labor movement, demonstrating the courage of the Chinese working class and the solidarity of workers and students. But the Jasic workers’ movement was ultimately brutally suppressed by the CCP regime, with many workers and young students arrested, and dissemination both offline and online prohibited. This once again exposed the reactionary essence of the CCP regime as one belonging to a privileged bourgeoisie.

In the Huawei Meng Wanzhou incident, the CCP did not hesitate to take foreigners hostage, destroying Sino-Canadian/Sino-American relations to save this “princeling,” yet turned a blind eye to the arrests of Hong Kong youths Kwok Siu-kit and Yim Man-wah, who protested at Japan’s Yasukuni Shrine. This once again proved in fact that the CCP regime is one that only defends the interests of its privileged class, disregarding national interests and the rights of ordinary citizens—an “internal colonial” regime. (And at the time of the Meng Wanzhou incident, when a Huawei executive was arrested in Poland, both Huawei and the Chinese government quickly “cut ties” with him, which likewise reflected this discriminatory double standard of the CCP.)

Such a “motherland”—is it still possible to love? Although the regime and the people are two different things, one has to admit that at least among China’s vested-interest class, those with discourse power, and highly educated middle-aged and young men in China, whether supporters of the CCP establishment or anti-CCP opposition, whether nominally leftist or rightist, most are in fact either social Darwinists, reverse nationalists, or false nationalists—or even a combination of these (including some of those whom you once supported and helped, and for whom you once raised your voice in front of the Liaison Office). They are no different from, or are simply the mirror image of, what the CCP openly advocates or tacitly encourages. With such a state and such citizens, it is truly difficult to “love.”

And Hong Kong, in recent years, has also become increasingly “mainlandized.” The Hong Kong establishment is highly bound together with the CCP’s privileged class, and the suppression and erosion of Hong Kong people’s freedoms grows heavier by the day. Compared with the British colonial government, which at least spoke somewhat of modern capitalist humanitarianism (though in essence hypocritical, limited, and aimed at maintaining bourgeois and colonial rule), the CCP practices survival-of-the-fittest social Darwinism, using “patriotism” as a fig leaf while lacking genuine patriotism, with hypocrisy and shamelessness surpassing even that of the British colonial authorities. As for the promised pursuit of building a “new democratic society” and a “communist society,” those ideals were long since thrown to the winds.

Yet in such a country and city, under such an ideology and reality, you have nevertheless remained unchanged for decades, holding to the revolutionary beginning and ideals, unceasingly fighting for social justice. In the Legislative Council, before the Liaison Office, in Central, in Victoria Park, you have time and again fiercely denounced the ugly deeds of those arrogant scoundrels, with unrestrained power; you have spoken for laborers and women, supported political prisoners and rights defenders in the mainland, with sincerity and strength; for decades you have tirelessly rushed about, navigating among various powerful forces and complex gray networks of interests, striving to win discourse power and legitimate benefits for those who cannot speak or resist, step by step, grounded and practical.

You have also endured prison many times for your resistance. When I was detained in a police station and placed in a mental hospital in Hong Kong due to protest activities and self-harm, I could hardly endure even just a few hours in the sweltering environment of the Western District Police Station detention cell. It was difficult even to softly hum the “Internationale.” With that experience, I can even more profoundly understand and admire your resilience, bravery, and greatness.

For your words, deeds, and spiritual qualities, there are no words left to describe in further praise—everything has already been said, and no more can be added.

After the Anti-Extradition Movement and the crackdown of 2019–2020, the CCP regime completely tore up the contract of “Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong, with a high degree of autonomy,” abandoned the promise of “fifty years unchanged,” and took the opportunity to completely crush the political opposition and indeed all of Hong Kong’s civil society. Not only was violent resistance suppressed, but even resistance through peaceful means such as parliament and demonstrations was no longer permitted. This reveals the utter madness of Xi’s CCP, and also reflects the cruel, dark, and suffocating reality of today’s Hong Kong and all of China.

And it is not only China—the entire global situation makes one feel uneasy, even pessimistic and pained. The progressive waves that once swept the world—whether Roosevelt’s New Deal, the movements of 1968, the Carnation Revolution and the third wave of democratization, the rise of the Latin American left, the Arab Spring… all have passed and receded (though with some partial returns, such as Lula defeating Bolsonaro in Brazil). Today’s world is one of rampant right-wing conservative populism—from America’s reactionary forces of Trump-Pence-Pompeo-DeSantis, to India’s Modi, Hungary’s Orbán, Russia’s Putin, and even Japan’s Shinzo Abe and Fumio Kishida—regimes are undermining world peace and progress, and oppressed, vulnerable nations and peoples suffer even more.

In Hong Kong too, there emerged a strong localist populist force, which split the pan-democratic camp, intensified conflicts between the mainland and Hong Kong, and together with Xi’s regime broke the tacit understandings between the CCP and Hong Kong’s non-establishment, leading to a series of violent conflicts during the Anti-Extradition Movement. Of course, they should not be overly blamed—the CCP was the greatest culprit. But Hong Kong’s localists and the “brave fighters,” though their actions can be understood and sympathized with, were ultimately narrow and shortsighted, unlikely to achieve Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy, and deviating from universal justice. I respect them, but I also hope even more that they will in the end stand on the same front as Hong Kong’s pan-democrats and the oppressed people of mainland China.

Even more tragic is that the laboring class—which once represented the vanguard of advanced productive forces and new civilization—has undergone a split, with part of it becoming instead an important component of right-wing conservative populist forces. On the one hand, they strive for their own rights and benefits, but on the other hand they oppose women’s rights, LGBT rights, the rights of minorities and other vulnerable groups, even opposing workers in other countries gaining benefits, and engaging in competition and harm among workers themselves, while believing in various conspiracy theories and hate-inciting propaganda, becoming narrow, anti-intellectual, and blindly obedient. Although not all laborers are like this, at least a considerable portion of workers (whether in the West or in the Third World) have indeed degenerated.

In fact, the working class has always had a dual or even multiple nature. On the one hand, workers are the core of productive forces, the backbone of production relations, the main force of human industrialization, modernization, and civilization. Without workers, there would be no prosperous and great world today. On the other hand, the working class also has selfishness, ignorance, and narrowness. In China, the “worker aristocrats” of state-owned enterprises in the Mao era had already degenerated into an exploiting class and rent-seekers, whose value creation fell far short of their income, and who became a conservative and stubborn force obstructing reform. As for the lower and middle workers, their labor and contributions deserve respect, sympathy, and support, but at least a considerable portion of them are misogynistic, hostile to the weak (even though they themselves are weak), exclusionary of the different, cruel and violent, anti-intellectual and superstitious. Even though these problems are fundamentally the result of oppression, brainwashing, and manipulation by the ruling class, they must still bear part of the blame themselves.

Even in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the working class had these problems, but compared with feudal conservative forces and the primitive barbaric bourgeoisie, the conservatism and narrowness of workers were not so prominent. At that time, they even converged with progressive currents such as feminism, and throughout most of the 20th century they were part of the progressive forces, standing together with feminists, the disabled, minorities, and others. But after a century, with the development of the times and the reshuffling of forces, at least part of the laborers have instead regressed to a level of reaction comparable to the workers of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan under the Emperor and the military. When Brazilian truck drivers abandoned the Workers’ Party and instead fervently supported the far-right fascist Bolsonaro, calling for the return of military dictatorship, this most clearly revealed such a tragic degeneration.

Yet this degeneration is not entirely incomprehensible. Various forms of exploitation, oppression, deception, and violence place workers in pain and confusion, deprive them of good education, and leave them incapable of proper understanding and judgment, making them easily incited and exploited. Although compared with the previous two centuries, workers’ material conditions have greatly improved, still “it is not poverty but inequality that is feared; not scarcity but insecurity that is resented.” The widening domestic gaps between rich and poor in various countries, and the imbalances of economic and political development internationally, all harm workers’ dignity and interests. With industrial transformation and the development of artificial intelligence, with the proliferation of “rust belt states,” the traditional industrial working class is more anxious and lost than in the materially scarce past, naturally prone to be drawn to extreme ideologies.

And the political and economic elites and mainstream intellectuals have not sufficiently recognized and cared about the plight and suffering of workers—indeed, compared with the past, their attention has clearly receded. Today’s leftist forces, especially elite leftists, lean more toward feminism, sexual minorities, environmentalism, and other more “fashionable” and “champagne” issues (of course, these issues are not truly “champagne-like” or superficial, but indeed very real and important issues—yet they have distracted attention away from workers’ rights issues). The neglect and even abandonment by the elite class have deepened workers’ discontent and sense of rejection, making them turn toward conservative forces to gain real benefits and seek psychological security and belonging—and this, too, is understandable.

But understanding is one thing—the populism, conservatism, and narrowness of the workers are, whether for their own long-term interests or for world peace and progress, gravely harmful.

In short, today’s world is full of countercurrents, with conflicts breaking out repeatedly, and different social identities splitting and opposing one another. Compared with decades ago, the world is not more unified, but more torn apart. The “Chinese model” of totalitarianism, Russian expansionism, Indian and Japanese conservative nationalist populism, and Western right-wing hegemonism together fill this world with ugliness, with the weak insulted and devoured, and humanity’s future shrouded in obscurity. The entirely unjust Russia-Ukraine war of the past year has further shown the world blood, corpses, ruined families—the fragility of civilization.

In such a chaotic and extreme era, there are not only no longer “prophets armed to the teeth” to sweep away evil and remake the human world, but not even “disarmed prophets” or “exiled prophets.” The once somewhat influential Peng Shuzhi and Wang Fanxi have long since passed away, and as for Trotskyists of Chen Duxiu’s kind—with outstanding character, abundant talent, and democratic convictions—they are nowhere to be found. The Fourth International, apart from being active in a few countries, has overall become a ceremonial, symbolic organization, lacking both the strength and the will to push the world toward continuous revolution and renewal.

What is the way forward for the future of Hong Kong, mainland China, and the entire world? Ten years ago there were still blueprints and hopes, but in recent years things have instead become increasingly muddled and unclear.


Yet, the light of hope still exists, and it exists precisely in you and other righteous men and women who are now suffering misfortune, in your like-minded younger comrades, and in the peoples all over the world who love freedom and democracy and pursue fairness and justice. The “White Paper Revolution” that broke out across China at the end of last year reflected that even under the high pressure of totalitarianism, many people, including young workers and students, still bravely fought against tyranny and raised the shocking voice of a new generation.

And according to various sources, many of the fighters in the “White Paper Revolution” were directly or indirectly influenced by the ideas of freedom, democracy, and justice that arose and spread from Hong Kong, which helped renew their values and inspired real action. Since the CCP took control of mainland China and carried out a series of crackdowns, massacres, and literary inquisitions, the mainland people generally lost their backbone, their spines broken, their morality corroded. It was Hong Kong—more precisely, Hong Kong’s patriotic democrats—that rejoined the broken bones of the Chinese people, restored the broken spine, and carried on the spirit of Chinese civilization.

And you are the hardest rib among Hong Kong’s people, together with Szeto Wah, Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho Chun-yan, and Koo Sze-yiu, supporting the unbending backbone of Hong Kong, carrying forward and amplifying the brave national spirit of self-strengthening. When in mainland China, from officials to commoners, all bowed slavishly to the strong and trampled the weak at will, mouths full of lies, betraying trust everywhere, silent for the public but noisy for themselves, immersed in material desires and petty strife, it was you and other Hong Kong righteous men who, selflessly public-minded, upright and courageous, spoke without fear, pleaded for the people, saying what mainlanders dared not say, doing what mainlanders dared not do, allowing the long-suffering and long-fallen Chinese nation still to retain in one corner of Victoria Harbour a conscience and courage, and enabling many victims to receive real help and warmth.

These things are remembered in the hearts of many mainland Chinese. Although many have been deceived, misled, and incited, not all mainlanders are brainwashed. Especially with regard to you—every mainlander who knows you, whatever their political stance, basically holds you in admiration. Toward other Hong Kong democrats, there are many misunderstandings and misreadings, but there are also those who are clear-sighted. What you have done for the mainland is worthwhile, and I here express my gratitude to you and all of Hong Kong’s patriotic democrats.

The post–Anti-Extradition crackdown and the “National Security Law” have sought to break the backbone that Hong Kong had carried on, to conquer the last soil of Han resistance. From the practical level, they have already succeeded. But human beings have not only bodies, but also spirit and soul. For the warriors, even when imprisoned or killed, their lofty aspirations do not change.

Although such words may seem like self-consolation, they are not merely self-consolation. In Chinese history and world history, violence and darkness have been frequent, and even longer-lasting than the light. In dark ages, people indeed find it hard to overcome barbaric and ruthless conquerors. But people can resist in various ways—including with the persistence of the spirit and the resistance of thought—accumulating strength and spreading civilization, awaiting the return of the light.

You have endured prison many times, and each time you have steadfastly survived, becoming even firmer and braver. This time will be no exception. Even though after release you will not have the same freedom as before, as long as life remains, anything is possible. Compared with the Jacobins perishing on the guillotine, the Paris Communards falling in cemeteries, the Trotskyists who perished in Russia’s civil war and Stalin’s purges, today still affords more possibilities for resistance and more room for maneuver.

Struggle and revolution are difficult; construction is even harder. More than two centuries of leftist revolutionary history, though it created many glories, also brought or worsened many disasters. From the ferocity of Soviet Russia to the ruthlessness of Red China, from the secret shadows of the Stasi east of the Berlin Wall to the brutality of the Kim dynasty north of the 38th Parallel, the “shining path” has been littered with vile atrocities. “Communism”—how many crimes have been committed in your name!

Orwell’s 1984 and Animal Farm exposed most clearly and plainly the truth of such regimes called communist but in reality “Big Brother” dictatorships. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” “Big Brother”/“Napoleon”—such predators always triumph in this negative selection, dominating hundreds of millions of subjects; while “Goldstein”/“Snowball,” no matter how brilliant their achievements, merely wove garments for “Big Brother,” and the military-political systems they built for the liberation and defense of the people became machines that harmed the people. Today the CCP’s big-data totalitarian system, with its wide reach and dense penetration, has far exceeded Orwell’s imagination. (But Orwell, even seeing and partly experiencing such things, still upheld socialist ideals, clearly declaring himself a democratic socialist, not the right-wing liberal that some Chinese liberals distort him into.)

If Marx and Trotsky could travel to the present, seeing the rise and fall and mutations of the red states, seeing commoners and the weak suffering more humiliation than under Tsarist Russia or the Republic of China, perhaps they would abandon many of their former claims and prefer instead Europe’s social democracy, the “revisionist” model? (Yet we cannot, because of the red disasters of the past, deny the greatness of the communist ideal and the value of permanent revolution. Peace and prosperity built on the humiliation and suffering of commoners, especially the underclass, are not worth keeping—better to rise and sacrifice, turning brocades into scorched earth.)

What should the future world be like? From the Confucius and Mozi of pre-Qin times, to Plato and Aristotle of Greece, from the East’s “investigation of things to acquire knowledge” to the West’s “encyclopedias,” from the radical violent revolution theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Trotsky, to the Social Democrats’ Gotha Program and the “Third Way/New Middle Path” that gradually rose in the 1990s—countless have pondered and summed up. And the vicissitudes of human history, the rise and fall of regimes one after another, all tell us, “Comrades, we must still strive.” What the forebears did was what they ought to have done; the road ahead still needs later generations to explore and think through.

You have experienced decades of turbulence and mortal struggle, and surely thought more deeply than I, a mere junior. I also hope you will reflect even more on the way forward for Hong Kong and the mainland, and the blueprint for the world.

Although, perhaps it is already too late? The crisis brought by global warming may make Hong Kong, in a few decades, highly uninhabitable, and in a century submerged. Mainland China and indeed most of the world will also be frequently harmed by the high heat, floods, and droughts of the climate crisis. This will be a challenge even harder to reverse and resist than politics.

Yet perhaps people will, before the climate crisis becomes utterly unmanageable, find ways to solve or mitigate it? Still, one should not be overly alarmist, but rather remain rational and calm, doing one’s best within the span of life, thinking and changing, rather than despairing and abandoning.

The retrogression of Xi’s regime in these years has made Chinese laborers “toil yet remain poor,” white-collar workers trapped in “996,” migrant workers bleeding and sweating daily, struggling a lifetime and still unable to finish paying off housing loans; Chinese peasants still impoverished, discriminated against, subjected to various violences; Chinese middle school students working from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. for six years, doing useless toil that consumes but produces nothing; Chinese women—girls and grown women alike—bullied, harassed, harmed, as commonplace as daily bread, never with full rights and dignity. Others such as the disabled, HIV and leprosy sufferers, prison inmates, are year-round discriminated against and abused, living worse than death… They are trapped in poverty, insecurity, and injury, unable to speak clearly or resist independently, and under constant humiliation from the state machine to street thugs, they have lost the most basic human dignity and even the slightest courage to resist.

At such a time, it is all the more necessary for some to speak for them, to express their indignation and demands, to help them summon courage, to restore dignity, to resist tyranny with them, to seek a way out, to promote change. “Permanent revolution” includes not only political revolution, but also economic revolution, and more importantly, social revolution. The people of mainland China are, outside of North Korea, the most deeply bound and oppressed in the world, and also the most in need of change and liberation. Their eyes gouged, ears sealed, mouths blocked, arms cut off, legs broken, brains washed—they need the just and peace-loving peoples of the world to see, hear, speak, and act for them, to assist them in seeing and hearing, to restore their speech, to reattach their limbs, to enlighten their thoughts, to awaken their consciences, so that they can gradually stand up again, become self-reliant, and turn into a force beneficial both to themselves and to others, to the public interest, and to world civilization.

You and many Hong Kong righteous men have spoken for the mainland people for decades, for which I am deeply grateful. And now the mainland people are still evidently unable to resist independently, still needing you and the younger ones you nurture to speak for the nation.

I also know that today in Hong Kong, aside from the establishment camp that are the CCP’s running dogs, most others are local populists, the traditional pan-democrats have waned, and the radical left is rarer than phoenix feathers. But this city, which once erupted in a series of revolutionary struggles, still has many deep and passionate fighters. The famous artist Anthony Wong Chau-sang has shown much interest in the Fourth International, and is also keen on critical realist literature and historiography. He has trained many younger ones—surely some will be willing to inherit his mantle and ideas?

I think you are the same. Although today most Hong Kongers with rebellious spirit are similar in stance to Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Yau Wai-ching, Tiffany Yuen Ka-wai, in their localist self-determination and Hong Kong city-state views, and scornful of leftism and Greater China-ism, surely not all are like that? Chow Hang-tung, Ms. Ho Kit-wan are representatives of newcomers who are progressive and concerned with mainland human rights. But they are indeed too few and marginalized.

I hope that after you are released, you can give more teachings to Hong Kong youths devoted to justice, telling them of the century-long or even centuries-long suffering of the mainland Chinese, their present plight and despair. I also hope you will tell them where Hong Kong people’s bloodline, culture, and values truly lie. Hong Kong youth may despise and distance themselves from mainlanders due to their low quality, distorted values, and ugly society. But isn’t the current situation of the mainland and its people one of “longing for clouds in a drought, longing for generals in national calamity,” crying out for rescue by an “international brigade”?

1.4 billion souls suffer in pain, numbness, and decay. There must be a modern Prometheus to bring hope to their hearts, to clear the homeland dark even in daylight. Whether in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or countries around the world, whoever can bring democracy, progress, and justice to China—all conscientious Chinese will be deeply grateful.

Of course, the realization of freedom and democracy in mainland China fundamentally requires the mainland people themselves to rise up. External support can only play a role if mainland people respond and cooperate, not if they treat it as “hostile foreign forces” and hate it. As for mainlanders’ attitude toward Hong Kong democrats, the changes in Hong Kong-mainland relations in past years have indeed given disappointing and even despairing answers. But it should not be so forever. For example, many mainlanders, after enduring the tortures of lockdowns and quarantines during three years of “Zero-Covid,” changed their view of the Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Movement from hostility to understanding, respect, and even support. And now, as Xi continues retrogression and popular resentment boils over, perhaps mainlanders will more and more understand Hong Kongers’ values, ideals, courage, and persistence, merging again and resisting tyranny together.

If, after all these sufferings, mainland Chinese still cannot awaken in years to come, still hating Hong Kong’s freedom and democracy forces, then such people neither deserve to be saved, nor can be saved.

In any case, I still hope you will not regret your original intention, but persist in your ideals and spirit of struggle, and pass them on to more people. I have been inspired and encouraged by you (and of course also by other role models such as Yue Fei, Lin Zhao, and Xu Zhiyong), and have persisted to this day. Of course, the persistence of a mere nobody like me adds little to the grand situation. But if tens of thousands of such nobodies are united as one, then the flag of freedom will surely rise again to the skies, the bell of liberty will once more ring. Without resistance, how can there be change? To support the weak and lift up the fallen, with no thought of turning back—this is not only the motto of the League of Social Democrats, but should also be the common creed of every son and daughter of China.

There are still many things to write and say, and I cannot finish them all. What I have written and felt above is already quite fragmentary. Perhaps there will be other opportunities to make contact in the future. I hope you will be released soon, and also wish you and your partner Ms. Chan peace and health.

French Republican Calendar: An CCXXXI, Floréal, Day of the Lily of the Valley (Muguet)",a letter to hong kong leftist civil rights leader mr leung kwok hung history of mainland hong kong leftist movements plight of workers and the vulnerable national destiny and hopes for the future on the history of leftist revolutions national history injustice and the suffering of vulnerable groups the historical connections between the mainland and hong kong the distortion and misuse of socialism communism populism june fourth the pursuit of democracy the transformations of chinese liberals the future of the mainland and hong kong and personal reflections and expectations respected mr leung kwok hung i am wang qingmin a writer living in europe during my middle school years i already heard your name and learned about your deeds through media newspapers and the internet whether it was your struggle for the rights of the hardworking laborers and the suffering underclass your more than thirty years of persistence in calling for the vindication of june fourth and accountability for beijing s massacre your outcry for justice for the chinese people killed by japanese invaders in the nanjing massacre your fundraising for disaster relief for the people of sichuan during the wenchuan earthquake or your support for many political prisoners and resisters in mainland china your sense of justice courage and action have always earned my deepest admiration i have long wished to meet you but unfortunately have never had the opportunity five years ago when i went to hong kong for some personal matters and political appeals i once went to the league of social democrats in hopes of visiting you but i did not find you there a few days later when i went to the liaison office of the central people s government to scout the site in preparation for a protest i happened to see you and other comrades of the league of social democrats engaged in protest but at that time many journalists and police surrounded you and you left quickly i also worried about disrupting your protest and the media s interviews so i could not speak with you and in the end only watched you leave later after experiencing various things and traveling through many places i left mainland china and came to europe before i had even fully settled down i heard about the anti extradition law amendment movement that had erupted in hong kong in just over a year hong kong s political opposition was wiped out and civil society was completely destroyed and you too were imprisoned this was something i had never expected in these years whether in the unexpected twists and changes of my own life or in the shifting circumstances i have seen and heard in mainland china hong kong and the world i have come to understand fully the impermanence of life and of worldly affairs yet in this ever changing world what is needed even more is sincere perseverance and you are exactly such an exemplar one who for decades has upheld ideals abided by conscience and defended justice i have read about your life and many of your deeds and i know that from the british colonial era you were already committed to the socialist movement loving your country and your people and serving as a vanguard of hong kong s leftist revolution the revolutionary marxist league in which you participated was one of the very few hong kong political organizations of that era that clearly opposed colonialism capitalism and conservatism after the uprising the riots which in fact we should more properly call an uprising although the uprising was exploited and harmed some innocent people this indeed requires apology and repentance it was still on the whole a revolutionary struggle against colonialism and corruption in pursuit of justice was suppressed hong kong s leftist movement fell into long dormancy yet you unafraid of the high pressure authoritarianism of the british colonial authorities and of the chinese communist regime that colluded with them still held fast to your ideals even moving against the tide speaking up and fighting for laborers women and the underclass nearly single handedly carving out in hong kong a new path of continuing revolution that was both radical and yet peaceful and sustainable whether denouncing the dictatorship of the ccp or criticizing the hong kong establishment especially the liberal party and the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong for disregarding the rights and interests of the common people you always spoke with reason and power forcing them to make some concessions giving up part of their vested interests in order to placate laborers and the underclass it is precisely because of your presence that hong kong s workers and underclass people have had support and hope allowing this city steeped in the stench of brutal capitalism and marked by vast disparities between rich and poor to still let shine through its cracks the rays of social justice and the light of equality and fraternity even more worthy of admiration is that you are not one of those reverse nationalists who abandon the nation and the people for leftist revolution and internationalism on the contrary your ardent and sincere patriotism far surpasses that of the overwhelming majority of mainland and hong kong politicians and intellectuals whether in the diaoyu islands protection movement in denouncing the nanjing massacre in pursuing accountability for japan s war crimes and forced labor in criticizing the crimes of western imperial powers or in exposing the evil deeds of the british colonial authorities in hong kong and their discrimination and oppression of hong kong people you have always been passionate and sincere never wavering over decades your sense of justice your courage and your national spirit make me like a small blade of grass in the mountains look up to the sunrise in the east receiving lessons for the soul and strength in justice the sino british negotiations and hong kong s return were supposed to be another stage victory of the national democratic revolution but the motherland to which hong kong returned was not truly a national democratic state but rather one that was authoritarian and dictatorial marked by brutal capitalism collusion with conservative and reactionary forces of various countries this was not only the case in deng xiaoping s era it had already been so in mao zedong s era whether it was mao s thanks to japan s invasion his meeting with nixon or his kindness to pinochet and other latin american right wing military dictators burdened with blood debts the ccp had long since betrayed the nation and the people and abandoned the ideals of revolution deng xiaoping s era not only continued this but went further in launching the tiananmen massacre crushing the chinese nation s century long democratic dream after hong kong s return apart from hypocritically awarding a few small honors to certain people from the uprising as consolation the ccp completely tilted toward the powerful and the capitalists the ccp and the hong kong government were in fact even more pro power and pro business than the british colonial government the living conditions of laborers and the underclass did not see systemic improvement hong kong remained a paradise of neoliberalism and a filthy marketplace for deals among global elites while hong kong laborers and maids curled up in coffin homes the likes of jasper tsang feasted and toasted in banquet house and the straight line distance between the two may not have been more than meters in dealing with japan s invasion and the crimes of western colonialism the ccp on the one hand exploited these to rally and buy off the hearts of the people resisting the infiltration of the west and universal values but on the other hand suppressed genuine reflection criticism and accountability regarding japan s crimes and imperialist colonialism using false nationalism to stifle true nationalism constructing the chinese nation as a replacement to blur and dilute the real and powerful cohesion unity and emotion of the han nation in order to control the han people and along with them all the other peoples of the country in foreign relations whether toward japan britain the u s or the imperialist powers the ccp has always belittled them in words but courted them in reality seeking their favor and exchanging it for their support of ccp rule in china willingly acting as the territorial guard for foreign powers meanwhile the people of hong kong and mainland china especially the mainlanders have suffered the dual exploitation of the ccp elites and foreign colonizers directly and indirectly whether the friendship stores of the mao era or the sweatshops of the deng era both reflected that the nature of the semi colonial and semi feudal society had not changed in the jasic workers struggle in shenzhen was one of the very few large scale collective resistances in china since june fourth and also the peak of china s labor movement demonstrating the courage of the chinese working class and the solidarity of workers and students but the jasic workers movement was ultimately brutally suppressed by the ccp regime with many workers and young students arrested and dissemination both offline and online prohibited this once again exposed the reactionary essence of the ccp regime as one belonging to a privileged bourgeoisie in the huawei meng wanzhou incident the ccp did not hesitate to take foreigners hostage destroying sino canadian sino american relations to save this princeling yet turned a blind eye to the arrests of hong kong youths kwok siu kit and yim man wah who protested at japan s yasukuni shrine this once again proved in fact that the ccp regime is one that only defends the interests of its privileged class disregarding national interests and the rights of ordinary citizens an internal colonial regime and at the time of the meng wanzhou incident when a huawei executive was arrested in poland both huawei and the chinese government quickly cut ties with him which likewise reflected this discriminatory double standard of the ccp such a motherland is it still possible to love although the regime and the people are two different things one has to admit that at least among china s vested interest class those with discourse power and highly educated middle aged and young men in china whether supporters of the ccp establishment or anti ccp opposition whether nominally leftist or rightist most are in fact either social darwinists reverse nationalists or false nationalists or even a combination of these including some of those whom you once supported and helped and for whom you once raised your voice in front of the liaison office they are no different from or are simply the mirror image of what the ccp openly advocates or tacitly encourages with such a state and such citizens it is truly difficult to love and hong kong in recent years has also become increasingly mainlandized the hong kong establishment is highly bound together with the ccp s privileged class and the suppression and erosion of hong kong people s freedoms grows heavier by the day compared with the british colonial government which at least spoke somewhat of modern capitalist humanitarianism though in essence hypocritical limited and aimed at maintaining bourgeois and colonial rule the ccp practices survival of the fittest social darwinism using patriotism as a fig leaf while lacking genuine patriotism with hypocrisy and shamelessness surpassing even that of the british colonial authorities as for the promised pursuit of building a new democratic society and a communist society those ideals were long since thrown to the winds yet in such a country and city under such an ideology and reality you have nevertheless remained unchanged for decades holding to the revolutionary beginning and ideals unceasingly fighting for social justice in the legislative council before the liaison office in central in victoria park you have time and again fiercely denounced the ugly deeds of those arrogant scoundrels with unrestrained power you have spoken for laborers and women supported political prisoners and rights defenders in the mainland with sincerity and strength for decades you have tirelessly rushed about navigating among various powerful forces and complex gray networks of interests striving to win discourse power and legitimate benefits for those who cannot speak or resist step by step grounded and practical you have also endured prison many times for your resistance when i was detained in a police station and placed in a mental hospital in hong kong due to protest activities and self harm i could hardly endure even just a few hours in the sweltering environment of the western district police station detention cell it was difficult even to softly hum the internationale with that experience i can even more profoundly understand and admire your resilience bravery and greatness for your words deeds and spiritual qualities there are no words left to describe in further praise everything has already been said and no more can be added after the anti extradition movement and the crackdown of the ccp regime completely tore up the contract of hong kong people ruling hong kong with a high degree of autonomy abandoned the promise of fifty years unchanged and took the opportunity to completely crush the political opposition and indeed all of hong kong s civil society not only was violent resistance suppressed but even resistance through peaceful means such as parliament and demonstrations was no longer permitted this reveals the utter madness of xi s ccp and also reflects the cruel dark and suffocating reality of today s hong kong and all of china and it is not only china the entire global situation makes one feel uneasy even pessimistic and pained the progressive waves that once swept the world whether roosevelt s new deal the movements of the carnation revolution and the third wave of democratization the rise of the latin american left the arab spring all have passed and receded though with some partial returns such as lula defeating bolsonaro in brazil today s world is one of rampant right wing conservative populism from america s reactionary forces of trump pence pompeo desantis to india s modi hungary s orb n russia s putin and even japan s shinzo abe and fumio kishida regimes are undermining world peace and progress and oppressed vulnerable nations and peoples suffer even more in hong kong too there emerged a strong localist populist force which split the pan democratic camp intensified conflicts between the mainland and hong kong and together with xi s regime broke the tacit understandings between the ccp and hong kong s non establishment leading to a series of violent conflicts during the anti extradition movement of course they should not be overly blamed the ccp was the greatest culprit but hong kong s localists and the brave fighters though their actions can be understood and sympathized with were ultimately narrow and shortsighted unlikely to achieve hong kong s freedom and democracy and deviating from universal justice i respect them but i also hope even more that they will in the end stand on the same front as hong kong s pan democrats and the oppressed people of mainland china even more tragic is that the laboring class which once represented the vanguard of advanced productive forces and new civilization has undergone a split with part of it becoming instead an important component of right wing conservative populist forces on the one hand they strive for their own rights and benefits but on the other hand they oppose women s rights lgbt rights the rights of minorities and other vulnerable groups even opposing workers in other countries gaining benefits and engaging in competition and harm among workers themselves while believing in various conspiracy theories and hate inciting propaganda becoming narrow anti intellectual and blindly obedient although not all laborers are like this at least a considerable portion of workers whether in the west or in the third world have indeed degenerated in fact the working class has always had a dual or even multiple nature on the one hand workers are the core of productive forces the backbone of production relations the main force of human industrialization modernization and civilization without workers there would be no prosperous and great world today on the other hand the working class also has selfishness ignorance and narrowness in china the worker aristocrats of state owned enterprises in the mao era had already degenerated into an exploiting class and rent seekers whose value creation fell far short of their income and who became a conservative and stubborn force obstructing reform as for the lower and middle workers their labor and contributions deserve respect sympathy and support but at least a considerable portion of them are misogynistic hostile to the weak even though they themselves are weak exclusionary of the different cruel and violent anti intellectual and superstitious even though these problems are fundamentally the result of oppression brainwashing and manipulation by the ruling class they must still bear part of the blame themselves even in the th and early th centuries the working class had these problems but compared with feudal conservative forces and the primitive barbaric bourgeoisie the conservatism and narrowness of workers were not so prominent at that time they even converged with progressive currents such as feminism and throughout most of the th century they were part of the progressive forces standing together with feminists the disabled minorities and others but after a century with the development of the times and the reshuffling of forces at least part of the laborers have instead regressed to a level of reaction comparable to the workers of nazi germany and imperial japan under the emperor and the military when brazilian truck drivers abandoned the workers party and instead fervently supported the far right fascist bolsonaro calling for the return of military dictatorship this most clearly revealed such a tragic degeneration yet this degeneration is not entirely incomprehensible various forms of exploitation oppression deception and violence place workers in pain and confusion deprive them of good education and leave them incapable of proper understanding and judgment making them easily incited and exploited although compared with the previous two centuries workers material conditions have greatly improved still it is not poverty but inequality that is feared not scarcity but insecurity that is resented the widening domestic gaps between rich and poor in various countries and the imbalances of economic and political development internationally all harm workers dignity and interests with industrial transformation and the development of artificial intelligence with the proliferation of rust belt states the traditional industrial working class is more anxious and lost than in the materially scarce past naturally prone to be drawn to extreme ideologies and the political and economic elites and mainstream intellectuals have not sufficiently recognized and cared about the plight and suffering of workers indeed compared with the past their attention has clearly receded today s leftist forces especially elite leftists lean more toward feminism sexual minorities environmentalism and other more fashionable and champagne issues of course these issues are not truly champagne like or superficial but indeed very real and important issues yet they have distracted attention away from workers rights issues the neglect and even abandonment by the elite class have deepened workers discontent and sense of rejection making them turn toward conservative forces to gain real benefits and seek psychological security and belonging and this too is understandable but understanding is one thing the populism conservatism and narrowness of the workers are whether for their own long term interests or for world peace and progress gravely harmful in short today s world is full of countercurrents with conflicts breaking out repeatedly and different social identities splitting and opposing one another compared with decades ago the world is not more unified but more torn apart the chinese model of totalitarianism russian expansionism indian and japanese conservative nationalist populism and western right wing hegemonism together fill this world with ugliness with the weak insulted and devoured and humanity s future shrouded in obscurity the entirely unjust russia ukraine war of the past year has further shown the world blood corpses ruined families the fragility of civilization in such a chaotic and extreme era there are not only no longer prophets armed to the teeth to sweep away evil and remake the human world but not even disarmed prophets or exiled prophets the once somewhat influential peng shuzhi and wang fanxi have long since passed away and as for trotskyists of chen duxiu s kind with outstanding character abundant talent and democratic convictions they are nowhere to be found the fourth international apart from being active in a few countries has overall become a ceremonial symbolic organization lacking both the strength and the will to push the world toward continuous revolution and renewal what is the way forward for the future of hong kong mainland china and the entire world ten years ago there were still blueprints and hopes but in recent years things have instead become increasingly muddled and unclear yet the light of hope still exists and it exists precisely in you and other righteous men and women who are now suffering misfortune in your like minded younger comrades and in the peoples all over the world who love freedom and democracy and pursue fairness and justice the white paper revolution that broke out across china at the end of last year reflected that even under the high pressure of totalitarianism many people including young workers and students still bravely fought against tyranny and raised the shocking voice of a new generation and according to various sources many of the fighters in the white paper revolution were directly or indirectly influenced by the ideas of freedom democracy and justice that arose and spread from hong kong which helped renew their values and inspired real action since the ccp took control of mainland china and carried out a series of crackdowns massacres and literary inquisitions the mainland people generally lost their backbone their spines broken their morality corroded it was hong kong more precisely hong kong s patriotic democrats that rejoined the broken bones of the chinese people restored the broken spine and carried on the spirit of chinese civilization and you are the hardest rib among hong kong s people together with szeto wah lee cheuk yan albert ho chun yan and koo sze yiu supporting the unbending backbone of hong kong carrying forward and amplifying the brave national spirit of self strengthening when in mainland china from officials to commoners all bowed slavishly to the strong and trampled the weak at will mouths full of lies betraying trust everywhere silent for the public but noisy for themselves immersed in material desires and petty strife it was you and other hong kong righteous men who selflessly public minded upright and courageous spoke without fear pleaded for the people saying what mainlanders dared not say doing what mainlanders dared not do allowing the long suffering and long fallen chinese nation still to retain in one corner of victoria harbour a conscience and courage and enabling many victims to receive real help and warmth these things are remembered in the hearts of many mainland chinese although many have been deceived misled and incited not all mainlanders are brainwashed especially with regard to you every mainlander who knows you whatever their political stance basically holds you in admiration toward other hong kong democrats there are many misunderstandings and misreadings but there are also those who are clear sighted what you have done for the mainland is worthwhile and i here express my gratitude to you and all of hong kong s patriotic democrats the post anti extradition crackdown and the national security law have sought to break the backbone that hong kong had carried on to conquer the last soil of han resistance from the practical level they have already succeeded but human beings have not only bodies but also spirit and soul for the warriors even when imprisoned or killed their lofty aspirations do not change although such words may seem like self consolation they are not merely self consolation in chinese history and world history violence and darkness have been frequent and even longer lasting than the light in dark ages people indeed find it hard to overcome barbaric and ruthless conquerors but people can resist in various ways including with the persistence of the spirit and the resistance of thought accumulating strength and spreading civilization awaiting the return of the light you have endured prison many times and each time you have steadfastly survived becoming even firmer and braver this time will be no exception even though after release you will not have the same freedom as before as long as life remains anything is possible compared with the jacobins perishing on the guillotine the paris communards falling in cemeteries the trotskyists who perished in russia s civil war and stalin s purges today still affords more possibilities for resistance and more room for maneuver struggle and revolution are difficult construction is even harder more than two centuries of leftist revolutionary history though it created many glories also brought or worsened many disasters from the ferocity of soviet russia to the ruthlessness of red china from the secret shadows of the stasi east of the berlin wall to the brutality of the kim dynasty north of the th parallel the shining path has been littered with vile atrocities communism how many crimes have been committed in your name orwell s and animal farm exposed most clearly and plainly the truth of such regimes called communist but in reality big brother dictatorships all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others big brother napoleon such predators always triumph in this negative selection dominating hundreds of millions of subjects while goldstein snowball no matter how brilliant their achievements merely wove garments for big brother and the military political systems they built for the liberation and defense of the people became machines that harmed the people today the ccp s big data totalitarian system with its wide reach and dense penetration has far exceeded orwell s imagination but orwell even seeing and partly experiencing such things still upheld socialist ideals clearly declaring himself a democratic socialist not the right wing liberal that some chinese liberals distort him into if marx and trotsky could travel to the present seeing the rise and fall and mutations of the red states seeing commoners and the weak suffering more humiliation than under tsarist russia or the republic of china perhaps they would abandon many of their former claims and prefer instead europe s social democracy the revisionist model yet we cannot because of the red disasters of the past deny the greatness of the communist ideal and the value of permanent revolution peace and prosperity built on the humiliation and suffering of commoners especially the underclass are not worth keeping better to rise and sacrifice turning brocades into scorched earth what should the future world be like from the confucius and mozi of pre qin times to plato and aristotle of greece from the east s investigation of things to acquire knowledge to the west s encyclopedias from the radical violent revolution theories of marx engels lenin and trotsky to the social democrats gotha program and the third way new middle path that gradually rose in the s countless have pondered and summed up and the vicissitudes of human history the rise and fall of regimes one after another all tell us comrades we must still strive what the forebears did was what they ought to have done the road ahead still needs later generations to explore and think through you have experienced decades of turbulence and mortal struggle and surely thought more deeply than i a mere junior i also hope you will reflect even more on the way forward for hong kong and the mainland and the blueprint for the world although perhaps it is already too late the crisis brought by global warming may make hong kong in a few decades highly uninhabitable and in a century submerged mainland china and indeed most of the world will also be frequently harmed by the high heat floods and droughts of the climate crisis this will be a challenge even harder to reverse and resist than politics yet perhaps people will before the climate crisis becomes utterly unmanageable find ways to solve or mitigate it still one should not be overly alarmist but rather remain rational and calm doing one s best within the span of life thinking and changing rather than despairing and abandoning the retrogression of xi s regime in these years has made chinese laborers toil yet remain poor white collar workers trapped in migrant workers bleeding and sweating daily struggling a lifetime and still unable to finish paying off housing loans chinese peasants still impoverished discriminated against subjected to various violences chinese middle school students working from a m to p m for six years doing useless toil that consumes but produces nothing chinese women girls and grown women alike bullied harassed harmed as commonplace as daily bread never with full rights and dignity others such as the disabled hiv and leprosy sufferers prison inmates are year round discriminated against and abused living worse than death they are trapped in poverty insecurity and injury unable to speak clearly or resist independently and under constant humiliation from the state machine to street thugs they have lost the most basic human dignity and even the slightest courage to resist at such a time it is all the more necessary for some to speak for them to express their indignation and demands to help them summon courage to restore dignity to resist tyranny with them to seek a way out to promote change permanent revolution includes not only political revolution but also economic revolution and more importantly social revolution the people of mainland china are outside of north korea the most deeply bound and oppressed in the world and also the most in need of change and liberation their eyes gouged ears sealed mouths blocked arms cut off legs broken brains washed they need the just and peace loving peoples of the world to see hear speak and act for them to assist them in seeing and hearing to restore their speech to reattach their limbs to enlighten their thoughts to awaken their consciences so that they can gradually stand up again become self reliant and turn into a force beneficial both to themselves and to others to the public interest and to world civilization you and many hong kong righteous men have spoken for the mainland people for decades for which i am deeply grateful and now the mainland people are still evidently unable to resist independently still needing you and the younger ones you nurture to speak for the nation i also know that today in hong kong aside from the establishment camp that are the ccp s running dogs most others are local populists the traditional pan democrats have waned and the radical left is rarer than phoenix feathers but this city which once erupted in a series of revolutionary struggles still has many deep and passionate fighters the famous artist anthony wong chau sang has shown much interest in the fourth international and is also keen on critical realist literature and historiography he has trained many younger ones surely some will be willing to inherit his mantle and ideas i think you are the same although today most hong kongers with rebellious spirit are similar in stance to joshua wong nathan law yau wai ching tiffany yuen ka wai in their localist self determination and hong kong city state views and scornful of leftism and greater china ism surely not all are like that chow hang tung ms ho kit wan are representatives of newcomers who are progressive and concerned with mainland human rights but they are indeed too few and marginalized i hope that after you are released you can give more teachings to hong kong youths devoted to justice telling them of the century long or even centuries long suffering of the mainland chinese their present plight and despair i also hope you will tell them where hong kong people s bloodline culture and values truly lie hong kong youth may despise and distance themselves from mainlanders due to their low quality distorted values and ugly society but isn t the current situation of the mainland and its people one of longing for clouds in a drought longing for generals in national calamity crying out for rescue by an international brigade billion souls suffer in pain numbness and decay there must be a modern prometheus to bring hope to their hearts to clear the homeland dark even in daylight whether in hong kong taiwan or countries around the world whoever can bring democracy progress and justice to china all conscientious chinese will be deeply grateful of course the realization of freedom and democracy in mainland china fundamentally requires the mainland people themselves to rise up external support can only play a role if mainland people respond and cooperate not if they treat it as hostile foreign forces and hate it as for mainlanders attitude toward hong kong democrats the changes in hong kong mainland relations in past years have indeed given disappointing and even despairing answers but it should not be so forever for example many mainlanders after enduring the tortures of lockdowns and quarantines during three years of zero covid changed their view of the hong kong anti extradition movement from hostility to understanding respect and even support and now as xi continues retrogression and popular resentment boils over perhaps mainlanders will more and more understand hong kongers values ideals courage and persistence merging again and resisting tyranny together if after all these sufferings mainland chinese still cannot awaken in years to come still hating hong kong s freedom and democracy forces then such people neither deserve to be saved nor can be saved in any case i still hope you will not regret your original intention but persist in your ideals and spirit of struggle and pass them on to more people i have been inspired and encouraged by you and of course also by other role models such as yue fei lin zhao and xu zhiyong and have persisted to this day of course the persistence of a mere nobody like me adds little to the grand situation but if tens of thousands of such nobodies are united as one then the flag of freedom will surely rise again to the skies the bell of liberty will once more ring without resistance how can there be change to support the weak and lift up the fallen with no thought of turning back this is not only the motto of the league of social democrats but should also be the common creed of every son and daughter of china there are still many things to write and say and i cannot finish them all what i have written and felt above is already quite fragmentary perhaps there will be other opportunities to make contact in the future i hope you will be released soon and also wish you and your partner ms chan peace and health wang
