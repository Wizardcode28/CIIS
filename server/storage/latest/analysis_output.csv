1,How do you maintain your revolutionary optimism?,1qjtcv9,IndianLeft,2,1,2026-01-22 12:33:48,Divagaran5,"hi all. it has been a while since I believe social ownership of means of production to be the solution to solving most of the world’s miseries, and by that, the capture of political power by the working class by a revolution.

it has been a while, probably more than a year, and now I think and I see things and probably have a more Marxist outlook on life, i.e. seeing the base of the issue rather than seeing it on the surface. I think it makes me a better person, has made me I believe. I also organize whenever I have the time for it and do some other works. 

so day by day, the reality is hitting hard as we put thought to practice. and I see the revolution more distant day by day, though I never rule out the possibility of one brewing. because dialectical motion of things can never be static, with small changes, come the big ones. 

but overall, while speaking to my friends, spending some time with family, going out, spending time on internet, it just kind of hits that the capitalist mindset has taken over people. add to that the casteist and religious bigotry that exists beforehand. add the red scare propaganda to that. and most importantly, the idea of having a better life and a better world under capitalism which has been sold to the people.

in short, a petty bourgeois mindset has been instilled into the youth and almost all of India’s population.

and we’re a country dealing with fascism as we speak now. if things get even worse, globally and locally, communists, leftists, etc would be one of the first set of people to be targeted as history always says. 

entertainment, sports, cinema, philosophy, religion, news, etc are all in the hands of the few, and is adding fuel to the fascist fire. 

the oppositions instead of organizing are trying to fight within the bounds drawn by the fascists and I don’t blame them either, because they are ruling class forces.

the “communist” parties, the electoral ones, are revisionist. they tail the masses. 

even the anti-revisionist movements are split, and there’s no vanguard party.

and most importantly, as far as I’ve observed, the material conditions here point to a revolution certainly, but not sooner. it will take a long long time because we need to struggle, and more material developments need to happen to take things closer for the revolution.

in these times, how do you maintain revolutionary optimism?

for me, it has always been about possibility and impossibility, because a possibility can become an impossibility under certain conditions, also an impossibility can become a possibility under certain conditions. the rule of dialectics is to never rule out possibilities. 

I read that even Lenin thought the revolution was not going to happen in his lifetime. and a revolutionary should always do something to progress their class and cannot dream of a fruit the same day they sow the seeds and water it. 

I believe we’re going somewhere, and I’m glad, but still, the distance seem too far. and it gets tiring sometimes.

4,Life advise for Juniors from a failed Senior,1qjrqmp,Neet_india,4,2,2026-01-22 11:07:04,not_available_141,"Learn from my story below and don't make such mistakes in your neet journey. Thank you 

Now that I look back at my last two years i can only see a series of wrong decisions that has led to my current state. 

Just like thousands of NEET and JEE aspirants in India, I scored 96.2% in ICSE Class 10. I was flying high—full of confidence, maybe too much. I thought marks were everything. I didn’t look back, and I didn’t think ahead. It was just me, my percentage, and a dangerous amount of false confidence.

Everyone around me advised the same thing: “Take Biology. It’s perfect for you.” My two sisters were MBBS students at that time, so people assumed my path would be easy. I listened. I left behind my first love—Computer Science, a subject in which I scored 99 in Class 10—and chose PCB.

That was my first big mistake.

 

My second mistake was joining a coaching institute.

I joined Mo@ent7m Coaching in Purvanchal, Uttar Pradesh. During the admission process, they made big promises. They said I wouldn’t need to go to the main branch, that the same “best teachers” would teach us here, and that everything would be well planned. I believed them. I even convinced my father, who was clearly against this decision.

Looking back, I realise something important: good marketing can easily hide bad systems.

They promised batches of 50 students, two or three batches minimum. By the end of the year, our batch was left with around 20 students.

The management was chaotic and extremely unstable. In just two years, the branch saw four changes in managers and four changes in receptionists. There was no continuity, no leadership, and no responsibility. Teachers who were voted out from the main branch were sent to us as HODs, and even Class 10 teachers were asked to teach us NEET-level syllabus.

We paid ₹50,000 for study modules. Out of all the material, only 4–5 modules were poorly printed on A4 paper using the coaching’s own printer. The rest were normal, but the lack of planning showed clearly.

Teachers were the most unstable part of the system.

Physics somehow survived with one teacher till late Class 11—who eventually left.

Chemistry was a nightmare. Teachers kept changing every month. A single chapter like Chemical Bonding was taught by four or five different teachers, each with a different approach. Organic chemistry core chapters were taught by one teacher who suddenly disappeared. No continuity. No clarity. We were not students—we were test subjects.

Nobody protested. Some had accepted this life. Some were scared. Some just didn’t care. When I tried to raise my voice, I realised something painful: standing alone is harder than suffering together in silence.

The worst damage appeared clearly in Class 12, especially during practicals.

The coaching collected everyone’s JEE Main dates, promising they would plan practical exams without clashes. They failed completely. Almost everyone’s JEE dates overlapped with practicals. Students had to beg schools for adjustments. The coaching didn’t even inform the school properly.

Later, I heard from people in school that even the school teachers, administrators, and external observers were completely tired of the chaos created by our coaching. They were frustrated with the lack of planning and constant confusion. There was always some ruckus—arguments between school teachers and the representatives of the coaching—but despite all this noise, nothing ever improved for the students. We were the ones stuck in the middle, watching adults fight while our academics and mental health kept getting destroyed.

In vivas, we were questioned on experiments we had never actually performed. Written parts were somehow “managed,” but viva exposed everything.

Uniform rules were random. One day, without any prior notice, a teacher snatched a girl’s smartwatch and deducted marks from her internal assessment. No circular. No warning. Just punishment.

By mid-Class 12, I couldn’t take it anymore. I left coaching and shifted to online PW, trying to save whatever was left.

But the damage was already done.

My marks kept deteriorating. I failed my pre-boards. Slowly, my parents lost trust in me—not because they didn’t care, but because all they could see was my fall. I was working hard, but nothing reflected on paper.

Today, I am preparing to fight for a profession I don’t even like. I am taking a drop year and joining another coaching—when, with proper guidance, I genuinely believe I could have cleared NEET in my first attempt.

There is no hope for me this year. I’m probably not even scoring 80% in boards, and NEET has gone terribly wrong. Sometimes the thought crosses my mind that ending everything would end the pain—but then I realise that would only be the easiest way out, not the right one.

What hurts most is knowing that this wasn’t due to lack of effort—but due to false promises, brainwashing, negligence, and instability. This coaching didn’t just waste my money. It ruined my confidence, my mental health, and two crucial years of my life.

If I could go back to the day my Class 10 result came out and start everything fresh, I would give my life for it. But I can’t. All I can do now is tell this story.

If you are considering Mo#ent7m Coaching, please be careful. Ask questions. Demand structure. Don’t blindly trust promises. If not taken seriously, this system can ruin you too.

Sometimes, the cost of a bad decision isn’t money.

It’s time, confidence, and peace of mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Neet_india/comments/1qjrqmp/life_advise_for_juniors_from_a_failed_senior/,"Life advise for Juniors from a failed Senior 2 Learn from my story below and don't make such mistakes in your neet journey. Thank you

damage was already done my marks kept deteriorating i failed my pre boards slowly my parents lost trust in me not because they didn t care but because all they could see was my fall i was working hard but nothing reflected on paper today i am preparing to fight for a profession i don t even like i am taking a drop year and joining another coaching when with proper guidance i genuinely believe i could have cleared neet in my first attempt there is no hope for me this year i m probably not even scoring in boards and neet has gone terribly wrong sometimes the thought crosses my mind that ending everything would end the pain but then i realise that would only be the easiest way out not the right one what hurts most is knowing that this wasn t due to lack of effort but due to false promises brainwashing negligence and instability this coaching didn t just waste my money it ruined my confidence my mental health and two crucial years of my life if i could go back to the day my class result came out and start everything fresh i would give my life for it but i can t all i can do now is tell this story if you are considering mo coaching please be careful ask questions demand structure don t blindly trust promises if not taken seriously this system can ruin you too sometimes the cost of a bad decision isn t money it s time confidence and peace of mind,4,2026-01-22
