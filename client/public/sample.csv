281,The Rise of Religious Extremism in India: Why Can’t We Just Live as Good Humans?,10 comments,"I’ve been feeling really concerned about the growing religious extremism in India, and I want to share some thoughts and hear what others think. It’s not just one community—both Hindu and Muslim extremism seem to be on the rise, and it’s tearing us apart.Recently, I watched a video of Naseeruddin Shah, where he talked about how he doesn’t understand the obsession with what happens after death (like heaven or hell). He said something like, “Why should I care about the afterlife? I want to live my current life as a good human.” I found it refreshing because he was focusing on being a compassionate person in the present, not getting lost in religious dogma. But when I scrolled through the comments, I was shocked. Not a single Muslim commenter seemed to agree with him. Instead, people were attacking him, saying things like “You’re a fake Muslim,” “You’ll go to Jahannam,” or “Shame on you for disrespecting the Quran.” It felt like no one was even willing to consider his point about living in the now and caring for others.This isn’t just about Muslims, though. I’ve seen similar extremism among Hindus toohate speech, mob violence, and this “us vs. them” mentality. Whether it’s “love jihad” accusations, it’s the same intolerance. Both sides seem so caught up in defending their religion that they forget what it means to be human.Where is this extremist mindset coming from? India has always been diverse, with Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and others living together. But now, it feels like social media, politics, and even some religious leaders are fueling division. The BJP’s Hindu nationalist rhetoric and certain Muslim clerics’ rigid teachings aren’t helping. It’s like everyone’s being pushed to pick a side instead of finding common ground.I’m not saying religion is bad, but why can’t we focus on shared values like kindness and respect? Naseeruddin Shah’s point about living as a good human resonates with me because it cuts through the noise. Yet, the hate he got shows how hard it is to have a rational conversation about religion in India today.What do you all think? Is this extremism getting worse?

Bureau Staff\ \ (Worthy News) - More than 30 Christians were injured in a brutal mob attack during a peaceful prayer gathering in Odisha's Malkangiri district, with no arrests made nearly two weeks after the incident, according to multiple rights groups and local sources.\ \ The violence unfolded on June 21 in Kotamateru village, where around 20 Christian farming families had gathered to bless seeds ahead of the planting season. The prayer event turned chaotic when an estimated 400 individuals, reportedly armed with axes and sticks, stormed the gathering in a coordinated assault.\ \ According to Christian Solidarity International (CSI), at least 20 people sustained serious injuries and were hospitalized. A local pastor, alerted by one of the victims, contacted Malkangiri Police, who arrived at the scene to evacuate the wounded. Other community members fled to a nearby church, which is now serving as a makeshift relief center.\ \ The U.S.-based International Christian Concern (ICC) reported that the victims were attacked while eating lunch, and that the assault involved Christians from three nearby villages. Eyewitnesses claim that Hindu nationalist groups were behind the violence.\ \ However, Malkangiri police offered a different version of events. Inspector Rigan Kinda told The Telegraph that the clash began as a personal dispute between two brothers--one Christian and the other Hindu--that escalated over religious differences.\ \ Christian leaders have firmly rejected the police account, calling it a cover-up. They allege that the Bajrang Dal, a right-wing Hindu nationalist group, orchestrated the assault. Bajrang Dal's local leader denied direct involvement but admitted to growing ""spontaneous"" resistance to what he described as religious conversions by Christians.\ \ Tensions have reportedly risen since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a Hindu nationalist political party, gained power in Odisha's state government in June 2024. A local pastor told CSI he has received repeated threats and has stopped going to work due to fear for his safety.

Despite filing a formal complaint, police have not applied more serious charges such as attempted murder or religious hate crimes, sparking outrage among community leaders.\ \ On June 23, the Malkangiri Pastors Fellowship submitted a memorandum to the district police chief, urging the establishment of a permanent police outpost in Kotamateru and nearby areas. As of July 2, no arrests have been made, and no additional security measures have been implemented, according to CSI.\ \ Bishop Pallab Kumar Lima, who heads the Odisha chapter of the Rashtriya Christian Morcha, described the aftermath as ""a grave humanitarian crisis."" He has called for state-sponsored relief under the Odisha Victim Compensation Scheme.\ \ This incident is part of a larger pattern of rising violence against Christians in India. Between March and April 2025, fact-finding teams documented escalating anti-Christian attacks across several districts in Odisha, including Nabarangpur and Gajapati. One particularly disturbing case involved the exhumation of a young Christian man's body, with his family assaulted while police allegedly stood by.\ \ India witnessed one of its worst anti-Christian pogroms in 2007-2008 in the Kandhamal district, where over 100 churches were destroyed and thousands displaced.\ \ Meanwhile, a recent report by the United Christian Forum (UCF) indicates that, on average, two attacks on Christians occur daily in India. The UCF recorded 313 incidents from January to May 2025, involving physical assaults, social boycotts, destruction of religious property, and threats.\ \ Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh--both governed by the BJP--have emerged as major hotspots for such violence.

Unfortunately, due to the work of these particular sections of our community, we all are facing hate.

392,Why do Sikhs in India act like Slaves to majority?,51 comments,"Yes I’m an Indian Sikh and I'm sick of our people back home always trying to justify their patriotism to Indians. Did our people back then ever accept the ghulami of mughals? Like all I see is them saying how Indians are forgetting the countless times sikhs have been covered in the national flag while protecting india at the border. Like seriously it is so annoying that they have forgotten we are a sovereign panth. They think our sole duty of existence is to go die at the borders of india. It's so annoying how they try to prove something to these people we have nothing to do with. We dont have to prove anything to these people. It’s very interesting that when Sikhs follow their religion they are labelled terrorists. I even saw a petition to ban kirpans. Sikhs from India are born there. They have no choice but to be there. Their thinking is not reciprocal towards any ideas or facts that would suggest that they are not equal participants in the country they are stuck in. Its the reason why Sikhs born in western countries are passionate about human rights for the victims of 1984 but Sikhs in India say ""so sad too bad"".The most simplest is that Sikhs in India genuinely don't give a shit. They don't care that they live in a country that attacked Harmandir Sahib, killed pilgrims, massacred Amaritdhari Sikhs for 3 months, then raped and murdered Sikhs in Delhi, then raped and murdered Sikhs in Punjab for 10 years. They are ok wtih all of this. So long as they didn't suffer and their ""Indianness"" wasn't taken away from them. Its the reason why the mainstream Punjabi media is throwing Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sadana under the bus for January 26, 2021. Make the issue about why a handful of protestors don't represent farmer protest rather than challenging the authority of a country that links pizzas to Khalistan. Sikhs are modern day Rajputs who gallantly rode along Mughals while other Rajput kingdoms were being oppressed. I think Sikhs as a people should be skeptical of any nation state we reside in. Especially one as rife with corruption as India, especially with the rising tide of nationalism and Anti-Sikh and wide spread of Sikhophobia there. Everytime you open Internet there’s always a Hindu writing Lassi or Khalistani in Instagram Twitter Reddit or YouTube comments to demean Sikhs and saying “Canada kab joge illegal via DUNKI (Latest Bollywood propaganda of Anti Sikh and Anti Punjabi played by SRK) while Hindu Gujaratis are the most illegal migrants to USA.",Automatic-Ad3837,r/Sikhpolitics,https://old.reddit.com/r/Sikhpolitics/comments/1alw5xw/why_do_sikhs_in_india_act_like_slaves_to_majority/,34 points,1 year ago,"Why do Sikhs in India act like Slaves to majority? 51 comments Yes I’m an Indian Sikh and I'm sick of our people back home always trying to justify their patriotism to Indians.

417,She Was Just a Child: The Hidden Horror of a 13 year old Lower Caste Dalit Girl’s Ordeal in India,23 comments,"This girl isn’t a headline. She isn’t a statistic. She is a child whose innocence was stolen in the most horrific way imaginable — raped repeatedly by 14 men over two years aged between 15 to 54 belonging to influential community. She is also a Dalit. To those unfamiliar with India’s caste system, “Dalit” refers to the lowest rung in a centuries-old social hierarchy, historically branded as “untouchables.” In a civilized society, it should have led to an uproar and what not. But in India, there will be selective uproar when anything bad happens to women of higher caste. If it happens to women from lower caste, its an inconvenience to those in power who will silence the victims. Despite legal protections, Dalits continue to face systemic discrimination, exclusion, and violence. For Dalit women and girls, this oppression is multiplied by gender. It means being poor, invisible, and often unheard — even when they scream. This is Andhra Pradesh, India. 13 year old Dalit girl raped for two years by 14 men belonging to influential community who are aged between 14 to 54. Her ordeal started as perpetrators took a photo of her sitting with a classmate and then they blackmailed her. At present, she is pregnant, admitted at a govt hospital and looking at an uncertain future. In a quiet hospital ward in southern India, now 15 year old girl lies on a bed, eight months pregnant. Her body is bruised by time and trauma. Her eyes — if you looked into them — would tell you stories too painful for words. A Hidden Crime Her abuse began when she was just 13. A classmate, from a higher caste, secretly took photos of her. With threats and manipulation, he and another boy coerced her into submission, raped her, filmed the act — and handed her over to others like she was property. Over two years, 14 men used her, violated her, broke her. These were not just strangers. They were men from her village. Some were neighbors. And nearly all of them belonged to a dominant caste. In villages like hers, caste is power. And power, in the wrong hands, becomes impunity. Nobody Came Her school noticed she had stopped attending. But no one asked why. No teacher raised a concern. The health workers assigned to her village didn’t report a thing. Volunteers from women’s welfare groups said nothing. She had dropped off the radar, and nobody cared to look for her. When she became pregnant, her mother, struggling alone after the death of her husband, finally realized the horror her daughter had endured. She took her to the police. It was only then that the arrests began,17 people in total, including three minors. A Community That Chose Silence What followed was worse.

We even had inter-caste and inter-religion marriages in our family(with parents’ approval), but never faced serious backlash. Majority of my family were accepting, some opposed but eventually accepted. Since my childhood, the topic of caste has always been a taboo in my home and school. Students or teachers never ask others of their caste or where they originally come from. I know some students formed friendships based on their caste during my higher secondary education, but it never posed a problem like discrimination or got violent in the name of caste because students knew very well they will get expelled from the school. Me or many of my friends never faced problems due to our caste/religion, at least in our experiences during School, college or in workplace.

445,A Cry for Justice: The Brutal Assault on Dalit Low Caste Men in State of Odisha Exposes India’s Deep-Seated Caste Discrimination,1 comment,"In the heart of Odisha’s Ganjam district, a horrific incident has shattered the illusion of a casteless India. On a Sunday afternoon in Kharigumma village, two Dalit men, Bulu Nayak (52) and Babul Nayak (43), were subjected to unimaginable cruelty. Falsely accused of cattle smuggling, they were beaten, half-shaved, tied up, forced to crawl for two kilometers, and made to eat grass and drink sewage water. This was not an isolated act of mob violence — it was a stark reminder of the systemic caste oppression that continues to plague India, even in 2025 This incident is not just a crime; it is a mirror reflecting the ugly reality of caste discrimination in modern India. The perpetrators acted with impunity, emboldened by a society where Dalits — historically marginalized and dehumanized — are still seen as less than equal. The victims’ injuries, both physical and emotional, tell a story of a nation that has failed to live up to its constitutional promise of equality. A Village’s Cruelty: Caste in Rural India In villages like Kharigumma, caste is not just a social hierarchy — it is a lived reality that dictates every aspect of life. Dalits, historically relegated to the margins, are often denied access to common resources, barred from temples, and treated as less than human. Bulu and Babul’s ordeal began with a simple act: purchasing cattle for a wedding, a tradition meant to bring joy. Instead, it became a nightmare. The mob that intercepted them didn’t see two men with hopes and families — they saw “Dalits,” a label that, in their minds, justified violence. The attackers’ actions were calculated to degrade. Tying the men’s limbs, shaving their heads, forcing them to crawl — these were not random acts but rituals of caste oppression, designed to remind Dalits of their “place.” The demand for Rs 30,000 to release the cattle was not just extortion; it was a power play, a way to assert dominance over those deemed inferior. As the men crawled, bloodied and broken, under the gaze of bystanders, the silence of the crowd spoke volumes. In villages across India, such silence often enables caste violence, allowing perpetrators to act with impunity. The aftermath was equally heartbreaking. The police, preoccupied with other duties, delayed registering the complaint until late that night. Bulu and Babul, battered and humiliated, had to fight for their voices to be heard. Even as they sought medical treatment, their cattle remained in the hands of their tormentors. This is the reality of caste in rural India: a system where justice is a distant dream, and dignity is a privilege reserved for the “upper” castes.

450,She Was Just a Child: The Hidden Horror of a 13 year old Lower Caste Dalit Girl’s Ordeal in India,0 comments,"This girl isn’t a headline. She isn’t a statistic. She is a child whose innocence was stolen in the most horrific way imaginable — raped repeatedly by 14 men over two years aged between 15 to 54. She is also a Dalit. To those unfamiliar with India’s caste system, “Dalit” refers to the lowest rung in a centuries-old social hierarchy, historically branded as “untouchables.” Despite legal protections, Dalits continue to face systemic discrimination, exclusion, and violence. For Dalit women and girls, this oppression is multiplied by gender. It means being poor, invisible, and often unheard — even when they scream. This is Andhra Pradesh, India. 13 year old Dalit girl raped for two years by 14 men belonging to influential community who are aged between 14 to 53. Her ordeal started as perpetrators took a photo of her sitting with a classmate and then they blackmailed her. At present, she is pregnant, admitted at a govt hospital and looking at an uncertain future. In a civilized society, it should have led to an uproar and what not. But in India, there will be selective uproar when anything bad happens to women of higher caste. If it happens to women from lower caste, its an inconvenience to those in power who will silence the victims. In a quiet hospital ward in southern India, now 15 year old girl lies on a bed, eight months pregnant. Her body is bruised by time and trauma. Her eyes — if you looked into them — would tell you stories too painful for words. A Hidden Crime Her abuse began when she was just 13. A classmate, from a higher caste, secretly took photos of her. With threats and manipulation, he and another boy coerced her into submission, raped her, filmed the act — and handed her over to others like she was property. Over two years, 14 men used her, violated her, broke her. These were not just strangers. They were men from her village. Some were neighbors. And nearly all of them belonged to a dominant caste. In villages like hers, caste is power. And power, in the wrong hands, becomes impunity. Nobody Came Her school noticed she had stopped attending. But no one asked why. No teacher raised a concern. The health workers assigned to her village didn’t report a thing. Volunteers from women’s welfare groups said nothing. She had dropped off the radar, and nobody cared to look for her. When she became pregnant, her mother, struggling alone after the death of her husband, finally realized the horror her daughter had endured. She took her to the police. It was only then that the arrests began,17 people in total, including three minors. A Community That Chose Silence What followed was worse. Members of the dominant caste, the very community from which her abusers came, allegedly pressured her mother to stay silent.

Trump is secretly a scaly and one day while he was wearing his snake suit he tricked Eve and told her to eat the apple. He also killed Abel. He also lead the Mongol invasions of everywhere. And the Hun invasions. And the Mughal invasions of India. And the Viking invasions.Trump was the guy who started colonialism(only the invading part not the part where they provided technology and medicine to the natives). After Trump tested positive for Covid19, he spit on Native Americans, nearly driving them extinct. Trump also killed all the dinosaurs. He was also behind the Bronze age collapse. Trump single-handedly did the Triangular Slave Trade; hell he was the guy Trump bought the slaves from. Trump also beheaded a French teacher for disrespecting Mohammad, and blamed it on wholesome Muslimerinos. All the blood diamonds are produced by Trump. He was the guy who cut Congolese workers hands off because they did not meet his supply. Trump chased Kyyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha with a skateboard and beat him up and snatched his rifle, and used it to kill Jacob Blake. During the BLM protests Trump was the one who looted and burned all the stores. Even during the Charolletsville incident, they were all shadow-clones of Trump. Trump did Pearl Harbor and bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Trump was the mastermind of the Holodomor, the Great Leap Forward, East Germany and every time a tankie screams ""It was not real communism"", Trump was involved. Trump grilled the last dodo.

Trump personally snitched on Anne Frank to Trump. The Jim Crow laws were passed by Trump, as well as the war on drugs. The partition of India was Trump's fault, as well as the resulting Kashmir issue. He also starred in the Cuban missile crisis and started the cold war. During the Russian Revolution, the peasants understood that Nikolai II's family was innocent, and would offer them a chance to leave, but Trump massacred them. Trump tried his best but failed in preventing the American and French Revolutions, but he got back at them by causing the Reign of Terror. Trump tortured Louis XVI's son and forced him into saying that he had sex with his mother and aunt, and promptly guillotined them. Trump invented pineapple-pizza and Tofu-Chicken. He was the guy who snitched on Alan Turing, revealing that he was gay. The judge felt that such a respected professor could be sent away with a slap on the wrist, but Trump rigged the jury and sentenced him to hormonal therapy. Trump rigged the New York Stock Exchange and caused the great depression. In the town of Waco, he raped a woman, blamed it on a black man and lynched him by burning him alive.

I am in the UK for my PhD and my roommate (28F) is muslim. We usually get along very well and I have been respectful and accommodating of her religious practices. I am very aware of the rising islamophobia worldwide and try to advocate against it whenever I can. I feel the need to mention these things because they become relevant. I am an atheist myself. My roommate on numerous occasions has tried to discuss religion and theology with me, but I have quickly shut her down fearing that this may lead to a conflict due to our differences. After her several attempts of comparing our respective religious backgrounds, I firmly told her that religion is that one topic I don’t want to remotely touch in a conversation with her because I did not want an argumentative and tense relationship with someone I share a roof with and she understood and stopped. Everything was fine for months until she started following those drives on tiktok where people get a hijab makeover on the streets and look pretty and thought of doing such a drive of her own. I gave her a thumbs up and moved on until she said she wanted to practice on me. I told her that I am not comfortable with this. She told me it is just a piece of cloth and it won’t hurt to try because I may end up liking it. I firmly told her that while that is absolutely alright, I don’t want to try it on, because I am simply not interested. This went on back and forth for some time until she told me that she is glad my islamophobia is finally out in the open and I have exposed myself. I was shocked and I asked her what made her think that I am an Islamophobe based on this one incident when I have gone above and beyond for her comfort. I abide by all her dietary restrictions in our shared kitchen despite not having any such restriction of my own. Once I bought this beautiful statue of a Hindu Goddess (not for worshipping purposes but purely for aesthetic reasons) and she told me that she was uncomfortable with the violent figure. I immediately complied and packed it away without any argument. I profusely apologised to her and I told her that I have nothing against hijab just because I don’t want it on me.

She said that it was inappropriate for me to be engaging in these kind of things as a woman of my age and that I should focus on being a mother. I was mortified so I quickly agreed to not have sex. Two days later she came back to me and said that she heard us again so now she wants me to sleep in her room.
