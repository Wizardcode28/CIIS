5,Albert Einstein - a Zionist Activist,1qfx3h4,IsraelPalestine,22,41,2026-01-18 03:03:36,BizzareRep,"Albert Einstein the Zionist

Albert Einstein was a Zionist. A German Jew who was ejected from Germany by the Nazis, Einstein viewed the founding of the state of Israel as a very good thing. He was a sort of a Zionist lobbyist. 

Indeed, Einstein lobbied for the creation of the state, as proposed in the UN General Assembly partition plan of 1947. The Arabs of course rejected the plan. Einstein passionately endorsed partition. 

In the months preceding the vote for partition, Einstein wrote a letter to India’s prime minister, pleading for India to vote for partition. Einstein is often described as an “anti Zionist,” but some of the things written by him to the Indian leader would be considered “far right” by today’s leftists.

In the letter, Einstein essentially says - there is no Palestinian people. They’re part of an Arab nation. The Arabs have many lands. The Jews just want a tiny piece of the land. 

He wrote to India’s prime minister

 “At the close of world war 1, 99% of the vast, underpopulated territories liberated from the Turks by the Allies were set aside for the national aspirations of the Arabs. Five independent Arab states have since been established in these territories.Only 1% was reserved for the Jewish people in the land of their origin. The decision which led to the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration was not arbitrary, nor the choice of territory capricious. It took into account the needs and aspirations of both Arab and Jew, and certainly, the lion’s share did not fall to the Jews. In the august scale of justice,which weighs need against need, there is not doubt as to whose is more heavy.  The “small notch” in the land of their fathers, granted the Jewish people, somewhat redresses the balance.” 

Einstein endorses the Balfour Declaration, universally viewed by radical leftists as evil, while saying “the Arabs have many states and they’re vast. The Jews only want one state in their ancient homeland”. 
Source: 
https://hvk.org/2017/0717/18.html 

Einstein’s Zionist lobbying continued after the founding of the state. In the 1950s, Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, offered Einstein to become Israel’s president. Ben Gurion and Einstein were quite close. Both were Zionist and both were socialists. While Einstein was more socialistic than Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion were unironically socialist (Ben Gurion actually visited the Soviet Union once and spoke highly of Lenin. Ben Gurion later claimed his wife, Paula Ben Gurion, had a crush of Leon Trotsky when she was a young Jewish anarchist in New York City). 

Ben Gurion would not have offered the presidency to a man who he didn’t think with a 100% certainty was not worthy of it as a Zionist. 

Einstein politely declined. “I’m a scientist, not a politician,” he told Ben Gurion. 

Nevertheless, Einstein’s Zionist activism continued. In 1955, he was slated to read a speech on the radio in favor of Israel.

The speech was written by no other than Abba Eben, one of Israel’s most prominent diplomats. The speech condemned Arab hostility towards Israel. It drew a direct line between the Holocaust and Arab states’ aggression towards the Jewish state. A speech written by Abba Eben, this was an unmistakably Zionist speech. 

The speech said: 

“The establishment of this State was internationally approved and recognised largely for the purpose of rescuing the remnant of the Jewish people from unspeakable horrors of persecution and oppression .  . Thus, the establishment of Israel is an event which actively engages the conscience of this generation,” he continued. “It is, therefore, a bitter paradox to find that a State which was destined to be a shelter for a martyred people is itself threatened by grave dangers to its own security. The universal conscience cannot be indifferent to such peril” 

Einstein strongly condemned Israel’s critics: “It is anomalous that world opinion should only criticize Israel’s response to hostility and should not actively seek to bring an end to the Arab hostility which is the root cause of the tension”

While Einstein was more socialistic than Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion were unironically socialist (Ben Gurion actually visited the Soviet Union once and spoke highly of Lenin. Ben Gurion later claimed his wife, Paula Ben Gurion, had a crush of Leon Trotsky when she was a young Jewish anarchist in New York City). 

Ben Gurion would not have offered the presidency to a man who he didn’t think with a 100% certainty was not worthy of it as a Zionist. 

Einstein politely declined. “I’m a scientist, not a politician,” he told Ben Gurion. 

Nevertheless, Einstein’s Zionist activism continued. In 1955, he was slated to read a speech on the radio in favor of Israel.

The speech was written by no other than Abba Eben, one of Israel’s most prominent diplomats. The speech condemned Arab hostility towards Israel. It drew a direct line between the Holocaust and Arab states’ aggression towards the Jewish state. A speech written by Abba Eben, this was an unmistakably Zionist speech. 

The speech said: 

“The establishment of this State was internationally approved and recognised largely for the purpose of rescuing the remnant of the Jewish people from unspeakable horrors of persecution and oppression .  . Thus, the establishment of Israel is an event which actively engages the conscience of this generation,” he continued. “It is, therefore, a bitter paradox to find that a State which was destined to be a shelter for a martyred people is itself threatened by grave dangers to its own security. The universal conscience cannot be indifferent to such peril” 

Einstein strongly condemned Israel’s critics: “It is anomalous that world opinion should only criticize Israel’s response to hostility and should not actively seek to bring an end to the Arab hostility which is the root cause of the tension”

So there you have it - Albert Einstein, a friend of Israel. Next time you read some propaganda piece about Einstein and Zionism, keep this all in mind. When you know the facts, propaganda loses its power. 


",https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BizzareRep/comments/1qfx20j/albert_einstein_the_zionist/,"Albert Einstein the Zionist 0 Albert Einstein was a Zionist. A German Jew who was ejected from Germany by the Nazis, Einstein viewed the founding of the state of Israel as a very good thing. He was a sort of a Zionist lobbyist. 

Indeed, Einstein lobbied for the creation of the state, as proposed in the UN General Assembly partition plan of 1947. The Arabs of course rejected the plan. Einstein passionately endorsed partition. 

In the months preceding the vote for partition, Einstein wrote a letter to India’s prime minister, pleading for India to vote for partition. Einstein is often described as an “anti Zionist,” but some of the things written by him to the Indian leader would be considered “far right” by today’s leftists.

In the letter, Einstein essentially says - there is no Palestinian people. They’re part of an Arab nation. The Arabs have many lands. The Jews just want a tiny piece of the land. 

He wrote to India’s prime minister

 “At the close of world war 1, 99% of the vast, underpopulated territories liberated from the Turks by the Allies were set aside for the national aspirations of the Arabs. Five independent Arab states have since been established in these territories.Only 1% was reserved for the Jewish people in the land of their origin. The decision which led to the proclamation of the Balfour Declaration was not arbitrary, nor the choice of territory capricious. It took into account the needs and aspirations of both Arab and Jew, and certainly, the lion’s share did not fall to the Jews. In the august scale of justice,which weighs need against need, there is not doubt as to whose is more heavy.  The “small notch” in the land of their fathers, granted the Jewish people, somewhat redresses the balance.” 

Einstein endorses the Balfour Declaration, universally viewed by radical leftists as evil, while saying “the Arabs have many states and they’re vast. The Jews only want one state in their ancient homeland”.

8,How do ordinary Chinese people view Maozedong？,1qfwat3,China,33,74,2026-01-18 02:26:46,Fuzzy-Assistant-7048,"Today, I would like to share with you the true image of Chairman Mao in the hearts of ordinary people in mainland China. The answer is — he was a great leader. No matter how foreign media attempts to belittle and insult him, we will not change this view.
I need to correct some of the stereotypes you have about Mao Zedong.
1. The Truth About the Famine
Many people believe that under Mao’s rule, China experienced a severe famine that resulted in the death of millions of people. This narrative has almost painted him as an evil “genocidal dictator,” even more malevolent than Hitler. However, this is not the whole truth. First, I do not deny that a serious famine did occur between 1959 and 1961, and that Mao made some incorrect judgments during that time. But the data surrounding the famine has been exaggerated and distorted, and it was not caused by Mao’s direct orders to seize food. Instead, it was the result of systemic issues leading to long-term malnutrition. Mao himself had neither the motivation nor the ability to create such a vast disaster. This kind of systemic disaster is akin to the large-scale deaths in some countries due to a lack of healthcare; while tragic, it is not something that Mao could be fully blamed for.
If we look at Chinese history, there have been multiple famines throughout the centuries, each resulting in horrific acts like cannibalism. Mao, however, ended the last large-scale famine in China’s history, and after that, China has never experienced such a disaster again.
Many people believe Mao took over a wealthy country, but in reality, he inherited a country devastated by war — ravaged by World War II, civil war, warlord chaos, and foreign invasions. In such a context, disasters were not unexpected. However, despite the poor conditions, Mao ended China’s last major famine. As for the famine’s cause, it wasn’t as simple as some claim — that the mass extermination of sparrows caused a plague of insects. In fact, China did have a “Four Pests Campaign,” targeting rats, flies, mosquitoes, and, initially, sparrows, in an effort to improve hygiene. However, during the famine, the focus shifted to controlling bedbugs. While changing weather patterns might have played a significant role, the most crucial factor was the misallocation of labor toward the production of useless scrap metal. Though this was a mistake, it was not Mao’s personal order. Meanwhile, people were still working in the fields. Not everyone was forced to make iron, but the people’s enthusiasm for labor was low. The real cause of the famine was the “People’s Commune” system, where everyone worked together, harvested grain together, and ate free food. The intention was to provide a society where no one would worry about basic sustenance, but due to its egalitarian design, it made people feel that no matter how much they worked, the outcome would be the same. As a result, food was consumed rapidly, but there was little active labor. This was, in essence, a very idealistic system designed by Mao, but it failed for a variety of reasons. Additionally, natural disasters and the depletion of food reserves, alongside the push for urban industrial development, led to a long-term nutritional deficit. It was a complex problem with multiple contributing factors. One reason Mao asked the youth to make iron was that he was misled by lower-level officials who assured him that there was plenty of food. Mao’s error was trusting this information, though he was a sincere idealist. We should not label him as an evil dictator for this. Otherwise, it would be difficult to understand why Chinese farmers did not rebel against the Communist Party during the Great Famine. In fact, during this period, almost no farmers rebelled because they understood how the food had been depleted. You might say Mao was an idealist, and indeed, he envisioned a country where everyone could eat without paying, not one that would commit genocide. Many foreign commentators erroneously attribute the famine to the extermination of sparrows and the iron-making campaign, and even fabricate the existence of “grain requisition teams” — but these overlook the key issue of the “People’s Commune” system. I suspect they don’t want you to know that Mao implemented such a people-oriented system, as this would shatter the “tyrant” narrative.
2. Mao and the Intellectuals
There is a claim that Mao ordered the humiliation of teachers and people with differing opinions, which indeed occurred to some extent. However, the reality is quite different from the propaganda. Mao was never like other dictators who kept a secret list of political enemies or had a secret police force. In fact, Mao did not order the humiliation of anyone. This was not a top-down purge but rather a call for the masses to actively maintain the socialist system. Most people responded to this call, but some took advantage of the situation to gain political power. They exaggerated and distorted Mao’s instructions, destroying cultural artifacts and humiliating intellectuals (because, in those days, intellectuals were often wealthy). Mao himself trusted the choice of the masses over intellectual reports. He often said that “the eyes of the masses are sharp,” which is why during the years 1966–1976 and 1956, many intellectuals were wrongfully persecuted. However, these actions were not direct orders from Mao but the result of spontaneous actions by the people, some of whom were misled. Mao was not the typical dictator. In fact, one could argue he was one of the most democratic leaders in history. He entrusted the power of decision-making to the people, who, in turn, trusted him and elevated him to the highest position. This was a paradoxical time when, due to mass adoration and Mao’s long-standing correctness as a leader, China’s extreme democracy turned into an equally extreme form of dictatorship. Mao trusted the direct choice of the people but did not believe in electoral democracy, fearing it could be exploited by capitalists. You can’t imagine ordinary people pulling out the head of state to humiliate him — but that happened during Mao’s Cultural Revolution. Clearly, many people were not professional in handling state affairs. Liu Shaoqi, an excellent chairman, was more pragmatic than Mao’s idealism, but this also meant he was more inclined to allow market disparities, which demotivated people. Extremists used this opportunity to rally the masses and eventually led to his death. While this was a tragic mistake, it was the result of extreme democracy. To label Mao as a dictator is absurd.
3. Mao’s Leadership and Achievements
Mao governed China for 30 years and led the revolution for 50 years. During this period, most of his decisions had a decisive impact on China’s fate. He confiscated the land of landlords, ended warlordism and foreign invasions. China’s population grew by about 78%, industrial output increased by about 2922%, total grain production grew by about 169%, and per capita income increased by 200% (though poverty remained). Life expectancy in China, which was about 35 years before the founding of the country, increased to 67.88 years by 1981. The infant mortality rate decreased from about 200‰ to 36‰ in 1981, the illiteracy rate dropped from about 80% at the founding of the country to 52.4% in 1964, and the primary school enrollment rate, which was below 20%, was nearly universal. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, China tied up most of the Japanese military. In the Korean War, China defeated the U.S. military. In the Zhenbao Island conflict, China defeated the Soviet Union, and in the western border conflict with India, China won — but Mao never took a single inch of foreign land. Mao’s policies successfully deterred foreign invasions without ever taking any land for China.
4. Mao’s Life and Character
Mao lived a simple life, and his descendants did not enjoy high official positions or wealth. One of his sons died in the Korean War, just like other ordinary Chinese citizens’ children.
5. Mao Ended a Century of Humiliation
Before Mao, China endured a century of humiliation. Mao not only ended this period but also led the farmers to overthrow the landlords’ oppression.
Indeed, Mao had many shortcomings, but if one truly sets aside stereotypes and takes an honest look at him, they would undoubtedly respect this great and noble leader.

an evil genocidal dictator even more malevolent than hitler however this is not the whole truth first i do not deny that a serious famine did occur between and and that mao made some incorrect judgments during that time but the data surrounding the famine has been exaggerated and distorted and it was not caused by mao s direct orders to seize food instead it was the result of systemic issues leading to long term malnutrition mao himself had neither the motivation nor the ability to create such a vast disaster this kind of systemic disaster is akin to the large scale deaths in some countries due to a lack of healthcare while tragic it is not something that mao could be fully blamed for if we look at chinese history there have been multiple famines throughout the centuries each resulting in horrific acts like cannibalism mao however ended the last large scale famine in china s history and after that china has never experienced such a disaster again many people believe mao took over a wealthy country but in reality he inherited a country devastated by war ravaged by world war ii civil war warlord chaos and foreign invasions in such a context disasters were not unexpected however despite the poor conditions mao ended china s last major famine as for the famine s cause it wasn t as simple as some claim that the mass extermination of sparrows caused a plague of insects in fact china did have a four pests campaign targeting rats flies mosquitoes and initially sparrows in an effort to improve hygiene however during the famine the focus shifted to controlling bedbugs while changing weather patterns might have played a significant role the most crucial factor was the misallocation of labor toward the production of useless scrap metal though this was a mistake it was not mao s personal order meanwhile people were still working in the fields not everyone was forced to make iron but the people s enthusiasm for labor was low the real cause of the famine was the people s commune system where everyone worked together harvested grain together and ate free food the intention was to provide a society where no one would worry about basic sustenance but due to its egalitarian design it made people feel that no matter how much they worked the outcome would be the same as a result food was consumed rapidly but there was little active labor this was in essence a very idealistic system designed by mao but it failed for a variety of reasons additionally natural disasters and the depletion of food reserves alongside the push for urban industrial development led to a long term nutritional deficit it was a complex problem with multiple contributing factors one reason mao asked the youth to make iron was that he was misled by lower level officials who assured him that there was plenty of food mao s error was trusting this information though he was a sincere idealist we should not label him as an evil dictator for this otherwise it would be difficult to understand why chinese farmers did not rebel against the communist party during the great famine in fact during this period almost no farmers rebelled because they understood how the food had been depleted you might say mao was an idealist and indeed he envisioned a country where everyone could eat without paying not one that would commit genocide many foreign commentators erroneously attribute the famine to the extermination of sparrows and the iron making campaign and even fabricate the existence of grain requisition teams but these overlook the key issue of the people s commune system i suspect they don t want you to know that mao implemented such a people oriented system as this would shatter the tyrant narrative mao and the intellectuals there is a claim that mao ordered the humiliation of teachers and people with differing opinions which indeed occurred to some extent however the reality is quite different from the propaganda mao was never like other dictators who kept a secret list of political enemies or had a secret police force in fact mao did not order the humiliation of anyone this was not a top down purge but rather a call for the masses to actively maintain the socialist system most people responded to this call but some took advantage of the situation to gain political power they exaggerated and distorted mao s instructions destroying cultural artifacts and humiliating intellectuals because in those days intellectuals were often wealthy mao himself trusted the choice of the masses over intellectual reports he often said that the eyes of the masses are sharp which is why during the years and many intellectuals were wrongfully persecuted however these actions were not direct orders from mao but the result of spontaneous actions by the people some of whom were misled mao was not the typical dictator in fact one could argue he was one of the most democratic leaders in history he entrusted the power of decision making to the people who in turn trusted him and elevated him to the highest position this was a paradoxical time when due to mass adoration and mao s long standing correctness as a leader china s extreme democracy turned into an equally extreme form of dictatorship mao trusted the direct choice of the people but did not believe in electoral democracy fearing it could be exploited by capitalists you can t imagine ordinary people pulling out the head of state to humiliate him but that happened during mao s cultural revolution clearly many people were not professional in handling state affairs liu shaoqi an excellent chairman was more pragmatic than mao s idealism but this also meant he was more inclined to allow market disparities which demotivated people extremists used this opportunity to rally the masses and eventually led to his death while this was a tragic mistake it was the result of extreme democracy to label mao as a dictator is absurd mao s leadership and achievements mao governed china for years and led the revolution for years during this period most of his decisions had a decisive impact on china s fate he confiscated the land of landlords ended warlordism and foreign invasions china s population grew by about industrial output increased by about total grain production grew by about and per capita income increased by though poverty remained life expectancy in china which was about years before the founding of the country increased to years by the infant mortality rate decreased from about to in the illiteracy rate dropped from about at the founding of the country to in and the primary school enrollment rate which was below was nearly universal during the war of resistance against japan china tied up most of the japanese military in the korean war china defeated the u s military in the zhenbao island conflict china defeated the soviet union and in the western border conflict with india china won but mao never took a single inch of foreign land mao s policies successfully deterred foreign invasions without ever taking any land for china mao s life and character mao lived a simple life and his descendants did not enjoy high official positions or wealth one of his sons died in the korean war just like other ordinary chinese citizens children mao ended a century of humiliation before mao china endured a century of humiliation mao not only ended this period but also led the farmers to overthrow the landlords oppression indeed mao had many shortcomings but if one truly sets aside stereotypes and takes an honest look at him they would undoubtedly respect this great and noble leader my english is very poor this is translated by ai please forgive me if there are any grammatical errors i m not an expert and i don t know everything welcome

10,Why Masaan is one of the most important Indian films of the last decade,1qfvgez,SocialfFilmmakers,21,2,2026-01-18 01:47:50,Active-Course-155,"Why Masaan is one of the most important Indian films of the last decade

Masaan matters because it quietly rewired how Indian cinema talks about caste, gender, desire, grief, and modernity without spectacle, saviours, or sermonising. It did not shout revolution. It lived it.

First, Masaan marks a generational shift in social realism. It inherits the moral seriousness of Parallel Cinema but rejects its distance. Earlier films often showed marginalised lives from above. Masaan places us inside them. Deepak is not a symbol of suffering. He is a young man with ambition, humour, desire, and rage. Devi is not a fallen woman asking for redemption. She is a person refusing shame. This movement from representation to subjectivity is what makes the film politically powerful.

Second, the film dismantles the upper caste gaze. Directed by Neeraj Ghaywan, Masaan is not about speaking for the oppressed but speaking from within lived contradictions. The Dom community is not romanticised or reduced to misery. Their labour, dignity, anger, and aspirations are shown as everyday facts. Caste is not portrayed as an abstract evil but as something enforced through police stations, job markets, families, and rituals.

Third, Masaan redefines feminist cinema in India. Devi’s story is not about punishment for sexual transgression but about the violence of moral surveillance. The police raid, blackmail, and appeal to caste honour expose how Brahminical patriarchy works through the state as much as through family. Devi’s strength lies not in rebellion through grand gestures but in endurance, self respect, and economic independence. Her refusal to collapse is the film’s quiet feminist thesis.

Fourth, Varanasi is not a backdrop but a social architecture. Masaan strips the city of postcard spirituality and shows it as a place where tradition and modernity collide daily. Burning ghats function as workplaces. Cafes and Facebook become temporary escape routes from caste policing. Space itself is political. Who can enter where. Who can love where. Who can mourn where. The city shapes every choice the characters make.

Fifth, Masaan understands technology as a double edged force. Facebook enables an inter caste romance without immediate surveillance. The same digital tools enable sexual blackmail and permanent shaming. Modernity does not erase caste. It rearranges how power operates. The film is one of the earliest Indian works to show this with honesty.

Sixth, the film rejects the heroic model of social change. There is no single leader, no climactic victory, no final justice. Change happens through small movements. Education. Leaving a town. Letting go of grief. Choosing to live. This refusal of spectacle is why Masaan feels truthful.

Finally, Masaan matters because it centres impermanence. Set in a crematorium city, the film insists that caste, honour, and cruelty are not eternal even if they pretend to be. Death equalises. Grief connects. Survival itself becomes resistance.

Masaan did not just succeed at Cannes. It changed what Indian independent cinema believed was possible. It proved that stories rooted in caste and gender could travel globally without dilution. It opened space for filmmakers to tell intimate political stories without apology.

11,Mehta cancels all his performances in Israel as a protest against Netanyahu's policies,1qftm6m,classicalmusic,293,70,2026-01-18 00:24:54,Ok-Prompt2360,"As per the article:

>Legendary conductor Zubin Mehta, who led the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra for nearly 50 years, says that he has canceled all his performances in Israel in protest of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies regarding the Palestinians.

>“I cancelled all my engagements in Israel this year because of my objection to Mr Netanyahu’s way of treating the whole Palestinian issue,” Mehta says in an interview with India Today, adding that he hopes that Netanyahu will be voted out of office at the next elections.

>The 89-year-old Indian maestro cancelled a number of performances in Israel at the end of last year, citing health issues.

What are your thoughts?

I don't like when politics and music get mixed, I remember when the invasion of Ukrain happened and I was at the first representation of Pikovaya dama at La Scala in Milan. When Gergiev entered the room he got booed immediately, even before starting to conduct.

I remember that was unfair artistically speaking, but inevitable politically speaking since Gergiev has always been very close to Putin.

Mehta's case is different. I personally admire him for this choice, for taking a side. He's a legend and has nothing to lose at his age, but still standing for something you believe is right, especially having this long tie with the Israel Philharmonic, sends a strong message of protest against what is happening is Palestine and Israel.

  
I'm curious to know what you think, leaving behind any political belief, and keeping a respectful tone of voice. Thanks!

12,Suggested Tweaks to India in Victoria 3,1qft9ud,victoria3,9,0,2026-01-18 00:10:16,Which_Impression4262,"I want to start off by saying, I really enjoy the Victoria 3 content for India and I think Paradox has done its research with regards to how to make India content super unique. That being said, I have a few minor tweaks and some criticisms that I think can be worked upon to make India even more fun and accurate. I’ve broken down these criticisms into essentially 2 categories: Characters & Map. So moving alphabetically:

1. **Characters**:  I really enjoy the sheer breadth of characters available to be recruited in India and, in general, I also appreciate how they are used and divided. Nevertheless, I do feel as though there are some key players missing that I would really have liked to see, due to their influence on India, as well as some characters whose ideologies I think could be improved. I will therefore divide this section into two parts: a) **characters that I think need to be added**, and b) **characters that I think need to be fixed**.
   * a) **Characters that I think need to be added:** To start, there is a massive lack of Radical Left and Radical Right characters in India. I understand why there is a lack of radical right characters: most radical right policies favor ethnic supremacy, and in the case of India under the British Raj, the dominant ruling ethnic group is English and religiously Protestant. That would make little sense for Indian figures like Aurobindo Ghosh, who might be more religiously focused but their ideas were rooted in Hinduism not protestant supremacy. From a game mechanics point of view, I can see why that decision was made. My issue is the lack of representation of the radical left. This is strange to me, as India had a robust communist movement in the early 1900s. There was even an attempt to instigate a revolt in 1914 led by Indian leftist Ghadarites. With this in mind, I think India would benefit from the inclusion of two characters who were influential in India:
      * **Manabendra Nath Roy (Communist in Trade Unions or Civil Servants):** Roy is widely regarded as one of the foundational pillars of the communist movement in India, and also in Mexico. He founded both the Communist Party of India and Mexico’s Socialist Party, which became the Communist Party of Mexico two years later. If there is a character who traveled widely and engaged with communist groups across the world, it was Roy. He operated in places like Berlin, Argentina, and China. If someone is missing from the game, it is him
      * **Sahajanand Saraswati (Land Reformer in Ryots):** Initially a nationalist leader, Saraswati became a prominent communist organizer who created the single largest peasant union in India, the All-India Kisan Sabha. The movement began in Bihar with the intent to mobilize peasant grievances against zamindari attacks on occupancy rights, helping spark later farmers’ movements in India. He became a communist in the early 1900s as he began studying Marxism. Without Saraswati, there would be no peasant movement in India, a movement that played a major role in multiple insurgencies in colonial India (the Kisan Sabha movement, No Rent movements, the Tebhaga movement, and others), post-independence India (such as the Hyderabad insurgency), and even modern movements (including the Naxalite movement).
   * b) **Characters that I think need to be fixed:** Beyond adding characters, there are also major issues in how certain existing characters are depicted, including the ideologies they are assigned and the interest groups they belong to. Below is a list, along with my reasons for each:
      * **Bhagat Singh (FIXED to Communist in Civil Servants/Trade Unions, not Anarchist in Civil Servants):** This one is potentially controversial and depends on which phase of Singh’s life you focus on. I will be honest that this is partly based on opinion, and keeping him as an anarchist is not inherently incorrect if you focus on different writings and influences. Nevertheless, in much of Bhagat Singh’s short life he became more closely aligned with Lenin and Marx than with Bakunin. He did employ methods commonly associated with anarchist practice, and in the context of colonial India those methods did produce results. That said, he stated that he was a communist who wanted to push India toward a socialist state rather than dissolve the state, which would be the anarchist position. He quoted both Bakunin and Lenin, even if he seemed to favor Lenin in his commentary, so I can see the argument for either label. Still, I think this “either-or” quality makes him a better fit for communist in the game’s framework as it is more representative of the middle position between anarchist (representing his Bakuninist tendencies), and vanguardist (representing his Leninist tendencies). I also have reservations regarding making Singh part of the Civil Servants. He never served in it nor did he participate in the British government. Nevertheless, I can see an argument for it as he was part of the left intelligentsia so I cannot be too critical. I would say however that you could also make a case to include him in the Trade Union interest group by arguing that he created the ""Naujawan Bharat Sabha"" or the Young India Union. This however was more of a youth organization. Moreover, his early mentor did find the All-India Trade Union Congress (which was the largest trade union federation in India) and Singh did speak at it few times. Moreover, he was imprisoned and executed after throwing a bomb into the Central Legislative Assembly to protest against the Trade Disputes Bill of 1929 which was a repressive British law aimed to crush workers' rights, strike ability, and suppress political dissent
      * **Mohandas Gandhi (FIXED to Humanitarian in Bhadralok/Ryots, not Humanitarian in Civil Servants):** Unlike Jinnah, who served on the Viceroy’s Council, Gandhi was never in the British government or in the civil service. Moreover this mismatch highlighted by the fact that Gandhi was a Hindu petty-bourgeois figure more plausibly associated with the Bhadralok. That said, I think Ryots fits him even better, though Bhadralok would also be defensible. The key feature Gandhi brought into the Indian National Congress was mass participation, especially among villagers. The Non-Cooperation movement and his satyagrahas aimed to transform Congress from an elite club into a mass organization. Gandhi was, therefore, someone who mobilized the Indian masses by bringing the villages into the discourse surrounding national independence. Therefore, I believe the Ryot catgeory fits him better.
      * **Muhammad Ali Jinnah (FIXED to Sovereignist in Civil Servants, not Social Democrat in Civil Servants):** Jinnah being represented as a social democrat does not fit his politics at any point in his life. Early on, during his time in the Indian National Congress, he was aligned with the liberal Gokhale faction. He opposed the Tilakite faction and was mentored by figures such as Dadabhai Naoroji and Pherozeshah Mehta. He was even on friendly terms with Tilak despite their disagreements, and defended him, as his lawyer, against British charges of sedetion on multiple occasions. Like many liberals who departed earlier either to run as independents or to form the National Liberal Party of India, Jinnah opposed campaigns that required abandoning British institutions that provided Indians some level of representation. He left the INC when it embraced Gandhi's non-cooperation (which included non-participation in all institutions created by the colonial government). Later, during the partition era, he was still not strongly associated with universal suffrage as a primary cause. Even during the various British discussions/commissions/conferences to outline more responsible government in British India, Nehru’s main demand, in addition to complete independence, was universal suffrage, and Jinnah was either skeptical or largely quiet on universal suffrage (he remained vocal on independence; though he initially advocated for independence through dominion). That does not mean he opposed it outright, but it was not his central project. Instead, I think “Sovereignist” fits better, because at root he consistently championed independence from the Raj. The specific independent entity he argued for changed over time, from a united India to Pakistan, but the core struggle remained sovereignty. Here, I would like to add, even the local police force preference makes sense as Jinnah wanted to recruit the Zamindars from the National Unionist Party into the All-India Muslim League to push for Pakistan.
      * **Udham Singh (FIXED to Communist in Trade Unions, not Radical in Trade Unions):** Udham Singh is currently in the game, and while I think this is a great addition, I disagree with confining him to “Radical.” In the game, a “Radical” is someone opposed to “Factory Councils” and “Council Republic,” which does not align well with Udham Singh’s views. Udham Singh was an avowed Marxist and communist. He was a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, a member of the Ghadar Party, and a close associate of Bhagat Singh. Keeping him as merely “Radical” is, in my view, a misrepresentation of his politics.
2. **Map:** I love the map changes that were introduced by the Victoria 3 DLC. I even made a post about Lahore on this very subreddit, but I took it down after I saw another post about the release. Nevertheless, there are still major issues with the map that I think should be revised. I have broken this section down into two parts as well: a) **changes in state modifiers**, and b) **changes in state boundaries**.
   * **Changes in State Modifiers**: The map of India has some great state modifiers and, in general, they are well placed. However, there are a few modifiers that are absent, and a few that make little sense in their current form. In particular, there is an issue with the Natural Harbour modifiers in Carnatic, West Bengal, Northern Circars, and Bombay. To start with the first two, neither Carnatic nor West Bengal has a natural harbour in the real world. This is somewhat more defensible in West Bengal, because you could argue that the Hooghly functions as a kind of natural harbour, but there is no excuse for Carnatic, which never served as a natural harbour. In fact, it was historically a poor location for a harbour, and the British had to pour massive amounts of resources into making it viable (it was their first main harbour in the region, they had to). That said, I understand why this decision was made: both locations were among the main ports of British India. So I do not blame the developers, but I think a simple name change, similar to what happened with the London Docklands, would go a long way. This is especially true for Calcutta, which was treated as the second city of the empire. This is also my main criticism of Bombay. I would prefer the modifier to be something more specific, such as “Bombay Harbour,” with a larger bonus to reflect its prominence. The last issue in this category is Northern Circars. The best natural harbour in India is in the Northern Circars, at Visakhapatnam, and the British began building it up quickly due to the need for a deeper, broader natural harbour. Despite this, the natural harbour modifier is completely absent. I think it would be a great addition to include a unique harbour modifier here, such as “Dolphin Bay” or “Dolphin Harbour.” This harbour could also have a larger buff than the ordinary natural harbour modifier (mirroring perhaps the Bombay Harbour modifier).
   * **Changes in State Boundaries**: The India DLC introduced changes that the game badly needed, but there are still some borders I would like to tweak. Specifically, I would like to fix two boundaries: 1) East Bengal and West Bengal, and 2) Sindh and Gujarat. Starting with Bengal, the game appears to use the 1947 boundary between East and West Bengal. The problem is that this boundary was not decided until after the game’s end date of 1936. It was not a boundary that was formally noted or drawn within the game’s timeframe. This is not an argument for merging the states, but rather for readjusting the boundary. Unlike Punjab, where there was no earlier division and using the later partition boundary is more defensible (as its the only practical option available), Bengal had a major administrative division in 1905, the Curzon Partition of Bengal, which created a real and historically relevant administrative border. In the context of the game’s period, I think that boundary makes far more sense than the current one. Moving on to Sindh and Gujarat, Sindh’s borders are mostly fine, except for one province on the northern side of the Rann of Kutch (southern side of Sindh) that is assigned to Gujarat. I understand why the developers made this decision, since it aligns with modern boundaries, but it creates an awkward result in-game. The Rann of Kutch is a salt marsh and is represented in the game as part of the ocean, which visually splits the state and produces an ugly border. From a purely aesthetic standpoint, it might make more sense to assign that province to Sindh to avoid border gore, though I will admit this is mostly a preference.",https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1qft9ud/suggested_tweaks_to_india_in_victoria_3/,"Suggested Tweaks to India in Victoria 3 0 I want to start off by saying, I really enjoy the Victoria 3 content for India and I think Paradox has done its research with regards to how to make India content super unique. That being said, I have a few minor tweaks and some criticisms that I think can be worked upon to make India even more fun and accurate. I’ve broken down these criticisms into essentially 2 categories: Characters & Map. So moving alphabetically:

1. **Characters**:  I really enjoy the sheer breadth of characters available to be recruited in India and, in general, I also appreciate how they are used and divided. Nevertheless, I do feel as though there are some key players missing that I would really have liked to see, due to their influence on India, as well as some characters whose ideologies I think could be improved. I will therefore divide this section into two parts: a) **characters that I think need to be added**, and b) **characters that I think need to be fixed**.
   * a) **Characters that I think need to be added:** To start, there is a massive lack of Radical Left and Radical Right characters in India. I understand why there is a lack of radical right characters: most radical right policies favor ethnic supremacy, and in the case of India under the British Raj, the dominant ruling ethnic group is English and religiously Protestant. That would make little sense for Indian figures like Aurobindo Ghosh, who might be more religiously focused but their ideas were rooted in Hinduism not protestant supremacy. From a game mechanics point of view, I can see why that decision was made. My issue is the lack of representation of the radical left. This is strange to me, as India had a robust communist movement in the early 1900s. There was even an attempt to instigate a revolt in 1914 led by Indian leftist Ghadarites. With this in mind, I think India would benefit from the inclusion of two characters who were influential in India:
      * **Manabendra Nath Roy (Communist in Trade Unions or Civil Servants):** Roy is widely regarded as one of the foundational pillars of the communist movement in India, and also in Mexico. He founded both the Communist Party of India and Mexico’s Socialist Party, which became the Communist Party of Mexico two years later. If there is a character who traveled widely and engaged with communist groups across the world, it was Roy. He operated in places like Berlin, Argentina, and China. If someone is missing from the game, it is him
      * **Sahajanand Saraswati (Land Reformer in Ryots):** Initially a nationalist leader, Saraswati became a prominent communist organizer who created the single largest peasant union in India, the All-India Kisan Sabha. The movement began in Bihar with the intent to mobilize peasant grievances against zamindari attacks on occupancy rights, helping spark later farmers’ movements in India. He became a communist in the early 1900s as he began studying Marxism. Without Saraswati, there would be no peasant movement in India, a movement that played a major role in multiple insurgencies in colonial India (the Kisan Sabha movement, No Rent movements, the Tebhaga movement, and others), post-independence India (such as the Hyderabad insurgency), and even modern movements (including the Naxalite movement).
   * b) **Characters that I think need to be fixed:** Beyond adding characters, there are also major issues in how certain existing characters are depicted, including the ideologies they are assigned and the interest groups they belong to. Below is a list, along with my reasons for each:
      * **Bhagat Singh (FIXED to Communist in Civil Servants/Trade Unions, not Anarchist in Civil Servants):** This one is potentially controversial and depends on which phase of Singh’s life you focus on. I will be honest that this is partly based on opinion, and keeping him as an anarchist is not inherently incorrect if you focus on different writings and influences. Nevertheless, in much of Bhagat Singh’s short life he became more closely aligned with Lenin and Marx than with Bakunin. He did employ methods commonly associated with anarchist practice, and in the context of colonial India those methods did produce results. That said, he stated that he was a communist who wanted to push India toward a socialist state rather than dissolve the state, which would be the anarchist position. He quoted both Bakunin and Lenin, even if he seemed to favor Lenin in his commentary, so I can see the argument for either label. Still, I think this “either-or” quality makes him a better fit for communist in the game’s framework as it is more representative of the middle position between anarchist (representing his Bakuninist tendencies), and vanguardist (representing his Leninist tendencies). I also have reservations regarding making Singh part of the Civil Servants. He never served in it nor did he participate in the British government. Nevertheless, I can see an argument for it as he was part of the left intelligentsia so I cannot be too critical. I would say however that you could also make a case to include him in the Trade Union interest group by arguing that he created the ""Naujawan Bharat Sabha"" or the Young India Union. This however was more of a youth organization. Moreover, his early mentor did find the All-India Trade Union Congress (which was the largest trade union federation in India) and Singh did speak at it few times. Moreover, he was imprisoned and executed after throwing a bomb into the Central Legislative Assembly to protest against the Trade Disputes Bill of 1929 which was a repressive British law aimed to crush workers' rights, strike ability, and suppress political dissent
      * **Mohandas Gandhi (FIXED to Humanitarian in Bhadralok/Ryots, not Humanitarian in Civil Servants):** Unlike Jinnah, who served on the Viceroy’s Council, Gandhi was never in the British government or in the civil service. Moreover this mismatch highlighted by the fact that Gandhi was a Hindu petty-bourgeois figure more plausibly associated with the Bhadralok. That said, I think Ryots fits him even better, though Bhadralok would also be defensible. The key feature Gandhi brought into the Indian National Congress was mass participation, especially among villagers. The Non-Cooperation movement and his satyagrahas aimed to transform Congress from an elite club into a mass organization. Gandhi was, therefore, someone who mobilized the Indian masses by bringing the villages into the discourse surrounding national independence. Therefore, I believe the Ryot catgeory fits him better.
      * **Muhammad Ali Jinnah (FIXED to Sovereignist in Civil Servants, not Social Democrat in Civil Servants):** Jinnah being represented as a social democrat does not fit his politics at any point in his life. Early on, during his time in the Indian National Congress, he was aligned with the liberal Gokhale faction. He opposed the Tilakite faction and was mentored by figures such as Dadabhai Naoroji and Pherozeshah Mehta. He was even on friendly terms with Tilak despite their disagreements, and defended him, as his lawyer, against British charges of sedetion on multiple occasions. Like many liberals who departed earlier either to run as independents or to form the National Liberal Party of India, Jinnah opposed campaigns that required abandoning British institutions that provided Indians some level of representation. He left the INC when it embraced Gandhi's non-cooperation (which included non-participation in all institutions created by the colonial government). Later, during the partition era, he was still not strongly associated with universal suffrage as a primary cause. Even during the various British discussions/commissions/conferences to outline more responsible government in British India, Nehru’s main demand, in addition to complete independence, was universal suffrage, and Jinnah was either skeptical or largely quiet on universal suffrage (he remained vocal on independence; though he initially advocated for independence through dominion). That does not mean he opposed it outright, but it was not his central project. Instead, I think “Sovereignist” fits better, because at root he consistently championed independence from the Raj. The specific independent entity he argued for changed over time, from a united India to Pakistan, but the core struggle remained sovereignty. Here, I would like to add, even the local police force preference makes sense as Jinnah wanted to recruit the Zamindars from the National Unionist Party into the All-India Muslim League to push for Pakistan.
      * **Udham Singh (FIXED to Communist in Trade Unions, not Radical in Trade Unions):** Udham Singh is currently in the game, and while I think this is a great addition, I disagree with confining him to “Radical.” In the game, a “Radical” is someone opposed to “Factory Councils” and “Council Republic,” which does not align well with Udham Singh’s views. Udham Singh was an avowed Marxist and communist. He was a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, a member of the Ghadar Party, and a close associate of Bhagat Singh. Keeping him as merely “Radical” is, in my view, a misrepresentation of his politics.
2. **Map:** I love the map changes that were introduced by the Victoria 3 DLC. I even made a post about Lahore on this very subreddit, but I took it down after I saw another post about the release. Nevertheless, there are still major issues with the map that I think should be revised. I have broken this section down into two parts as well: a) **changes in state modifiers**, and b) **changes in state boundaries**.
   * **Changes in State Modifiers**: The map of India has some great state modifiers and, in general, they are well placed. However, there are a few modifiers that are absent, and a few that make little sense in their current form. In particular, there is an issue with the Natural Harbour modifiers in Carnatic, West Bengal, Northern Circars, and Bombay. To start with the first two, neither Carnatic nor West Bengal has a natural harbour in the real world. This is somewhat more defensible in West Bengal, because you could argue that the Hooghly functions as a kind of natural harbour, but there is no excuse for Carnatic, which never served as a natural harbour. In fact, it was historically a poor location for a harbour, and the British had to pour massive amounts of resources into making it viable (it was their first main harbour in the region, they had to). That said, I understand why this decision was made: both locations were among the main ports of British India. So I do not blame the developers, but I think a simple name change, similar to what happened with the London Docklands, would go a long way. This is especially true for Calcutta, which was treated as the second city of the empire. This is also my main criticism of Bombay. I would prefer the modifier to be something more specific, such as “Bombay Harbour,” with a larger bonus to reflect its prominence. The last issue in this category is Northern Circars. The best natural harbour in India is in the Northern Circars, at Visakhapatnam, and the British began building it up quickly due to the need for a deeper, broader natural harbour. Despite this, the natural harbour modifier is completely absent. I think it would be a great addition to include a unique harbour modifier here, such as “Dolphin Bay” or “Dolphin Harbour.” This harbour could also have a larger buff than the ordinary natural harbour modifier (mirroring perhaps the Bombay Harbour modifier).
   * **Changes in State Boundaries**: The India DLC introduced changes that the game badly needed, but there are still some borders I would like to tweak. Specifically, I would like to fix two boundaries: 1) East Bengal and West Bengal, and 2) Sindh and Gujarat. Starting with Bengal, the game appears to use the 1947 boundary between East and West Bengal. The problem is that this boundary was not decided until after the game’s end date of 1936.

13,Restoring the wildlife of Arabia,1qfswwt,megafaunarewilding,68,2,2026-01-17 23:54:47,Reintroductionplans,"The Arabian Peninsula sits at the crossroads of the Palearctic and Afrotropics, creating a unique ecosystem that blends species characteristic of both regions. Historically, the region was home to a much wider array of megafauna than in the modern day. The 2024 paper titled The Lost Large Mammals of Arabia attempts to map out this once vibrant ecosystem. By studying fossil and subfossil remains, as well as petroglyphs they mapped out the historical ranges of many now extinct species on the peninsula. It is an incredibly interesting read, and I implore you to read it yourself, it is worth it. I have attached the paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389435666_The_Lost_Large_Mammals_of_Arabia), but I will be going over many of the major points in this thread. I will go over what these findings could mean for rewilding, as well as other species not focused on in the study, but still have great rewilding potential. Now, many of these species had finds from the humid period roughly 7,000 years ago, when the Arabian peninsula was much greener than it is. It is considered likely by the paper that many of these species would have seen severe population declines as the region dried out but would have survived in more humid montane areas without human pressures. So, let's get started.

First, we have the aurochs. If you weren't aware, true aurochs have been extinct since the early 18th century at the latest, but probably since the mid 17th century. However, captive breeding programs have bred cattle, their modern decedents into forms that closely resemble the extinct species who have been used in numerous rewilding projects to date. Historically, it was well known that aurochs once inhabited the Levant, however, findings in the paper greatly expand the species historic range. They highlight archeological finds and petroglyphs, as well as potential historic records from the 3rd and 5th centuries that show the species was once present in the mountains of Yemen, and possibly the coastal mountains of Saudi Arabia, although not certainly. These mountains average 30 inches of rain a year, allowing for shrublands, grasslands, and even forests to persist in this region. Aurochs are a keystone species that completely shape the landscape around them. Their grazing and browsing habits remove trees and create a mixed landscape that greatly increases biodiversity. Grasslands grazed by the species create great nesting habitat for many bird species, and their fur makes for perfect nest lining. Smaller herbivores like gazelle stick near aurochs for protection against larger predators. They are major seed dispersers both through there feces and seeds that stick to their fur. There wallows create sand baths for birds and nesting sites for reptiles and allow pioneer plants to grow. They pave game trails that hundreds of other species will use for transportation. Birds such as magpies feed on parasites off of the cattle, benefiting both species. There feces act as fertilizer and provide food and nesting locations for many insect species. Once deceased, there huge bodies support thousands of scavengers from boar to beetles to vultures. They could also be large prey animals for future lion reintroductions. Now there is a very obvious issue with this region. Yemen has been in the midst of a civil war since 2014, and this entire region is currently under the control of the Houthis. This makes Yemen no place for wildlife reintroductions, and it is certainly not the priority of any of the people in the country. However, if the nation ever does stabilize, aurochs could return to the region. The other region they historically inhabited is the Levant, which would also be a difficult reintroduction. Once again, this region is very politically tense and isn't really place for rewilding. Furthermore, this region is very densely populated, with only small, isolated pockets of nature remaining. Theoretically though, the mountains of Lebanon could possibly support wild individuals. However, there is a better option. Semi-wild individuals could certainly be established across the nation, similar to what is going on in much of Europe. This could provide the same ecological impacts of a wild population, without having the same issues.

The next species is the lesser kudu, which is a very unique species. The study found petroglyphs from the humid period in northern Saudi Arabia. Horns of two individuals were found in Yemen and Saudi Arabia in the 1960s, suggesting that a small, remnant population survived in southwest Arabia well into modern times. They could be very beneficial to local environments. Being browsers, they clear woody shrubs which allows other plants to grow, creating richer floral communities. Their dung also is known to spread seeds. Their dung also could bring added nutrients to very dry soil, improving its productivity. Finally, ranging between 120-250 pounds, they would make the perfect sized meals for leopards, wolves, and lions. They could likely survive in Yemen, if the nation ever stabilizes, or multiple regions of southwestern Saudi Arabia. Parks like Shada Mountain Reserve and Asir National Park could easily support populations of the species.

Next are wild goat. The species was known to have once lived in the Levant, and sighting were made in the UAE during the 1960s. The study identified petroglyphs likely showing the species from the UAE and coastal mountains of Saudi Arabia. They are browsers and help maintain plant communities in their native habitats. Their dung also fertilizes the soil and spreads seeds. They also are a perfect sized meal for leopards and wolves. Their ecological importance could be questioned when many of these regions also have Nubian ibex, but every species does count towards biodiversity. They could likely survive in the mountains of Lebanon and Yemen, as well as many Saudi Reserves like Shada Mountain Reserve, Asir National Park, Jabal Aja Protected Area, Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, and the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve. Overall, the species might not be the most important to local ecosystems but would likely still benefit them.

Next are aoudad, also known as barbary sheep. The species historically inhabited the Negev Desert. Their browsing and feeding habits increase plant diversity in their desert habitats. Their feces also spread seeds and fertilize the soil. Finally, they are a perfectly sized prey item for lions, leopards, cheetahs, and wolves. As a vulnerable species, establishing a new population in the protected regions of the Negev could be beneficial for the species. 

Finally for the bovids are hartebeest. They were once common in the southern Levant. Their grazing habitats prefer low quality grasses other species don't often feed on, benefiting the vegetation communities of their habitat. By removing these less palatable grasses, it allows smaller more nutritious grasses to grow which other herbivores prefer, boosting their numbers. Their dung also brings nutrients to the soil. Finally, they would be a great food source for wolves and lions. They could likely do relatively well in the Negev, which has already seen the reintroduction of oryx and onager.

Next are the largest animal native to the peninsula, the dromedary. Wild dromedaries were once abundant across the Arabian Peninsula, with the study finding the species to have been most common along the coast of the Persian Gulf, although they would have ranged across the peninsula. Being so large, they were major ecosystem engineers. As browsers of thorny scrubs, they prevent them from becoming dominant in an ecosystem, allowing plants favored by other herbivores like oryx to grow. They are known to travel long distances, spreading seeds as they go to distant oasis. Their feces also distributed fertilizer across their range. Finally, standing 7 feet at the shoulder and weighing up to 1,500 pounds, they are a perfect large meal for large carnivores like lions. The species has been extinct in the wild for thousands of years, but millions of domesticated individuals exist, who could be used for a reintroduction. They could return to numerous desert reserves like Shada Mountain Reserve, Asir National Park, Jabal Aja Protected Area, Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, the Negev, Al Marmoom, Al Saleel National Park, the Arabian Oryx sanctuary and many more. They could honestly return to most of the peninsula and bring much needed biodiversity to the region.

Finally for the artiodactyls are red deer, who historically inhabited the Levant. They are a keystone species to their forest habitats and are necessary for them to be healthy. First, their browsing and grazes opens forests and create mosaic habitats, greatly increasing local biodiversity. Their feces fertilized the forest and spread seeds. They are also a perfectly sized prey item for wolves. The species could likely due well in the mountains of Lebanon.

Moving on the perissodactyls, we have onager. They are mixed feeders and prefer tougher shrubs and grasses, allowing softer plants to grow which many other herbivores prefer. Their grazing also creates a mosaic of ungrazed and grazed regions, increasing local biodiversity. They are also known to dig for groundwater, creating watering holes that benefit thousands of species. Their dung spreads seeds and fertilizes soil. They are also the perfect sized prey for lions and wolves. The species was historically known from the northern half of the peninsula, although the study found a fossil tooth and possible 4th century report of the species from Yemen, however, due to the distance between Yemen and the rest of their known range the study says we should use restraint in labeling them as a native species of Yemen, so I am only going to stick to their known range. The species has already been reintroduced to the Negev, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, and the Shaumari Nature Reserve, although there are many other places they could return including Nafud al-ʽUrayq Natural Reserve, Harrat al-Harrah Protected Area, Al-Tubayq Natural Reserve, and Jabal Aja Protected Area.

Next are African wild ass. Historically, the species was not known to have ranged into the Arabian Peninsula, however, this study found archeological remains and petroglyphs in multiple regions. The species seems to have had a distribution hugging the coast of Yemen and the Gulf States, as well as being found in the Levant. Ecologically, they would fill nearly the exact same niche as the onager, however in the southern parts of the Peninsula. The species is critically endangered, so any new populations would greatly benefit the species. They could return to the mountains of Yemen (if it stabilizes), Al Saleel National Park in Oman, and Wadi Wurayah National Park in the United Arab Emirates. Their return to the Levant is less certain. Onager already live there, meaning they don't need to fill their niche there, and could risk hybridization between the two species, so keeping them from the Levant is probably a good idea.

Finally, for perissodactyls is the wild horse. The species was once found through the non-desert parts of the Levant. They are a keystone species for a few reasons. Unlike ruminants, there grazing habits strip most of the grass, leaving behind just the nutrient rich stems which small mammals like gazelle and hares like to feed on. Their feces both spread seeds and support fungi and insects. They strip bark off dead trees opening up woodlands benefiting many species on the forest floor. As they graze, insects flee making it easier for insectivorous birds to hunt. They also provide huge carcasses for scavengers once they die. Their grazing also causes more open vegetation lowering fire risks. They also are also the perfect size for predators such as lions and wolves. They also dig for roots and roll creating bare patches that benefit reptiles and insects and allow pioneer plants to grow. The species also feed on dead plants during the winter, allowing for new species to move in when the snow melts in more montane regions. They also dig up snow to graze, exposing vegetation for other species to eat. Semi wild herds, like what are seen in much of Europe could likely be established in many parts of the Levant, especially in the mountains of Lebanon.

Starting with carnivores we have cheetah. The species once was found across the entire peninsula, with the studies showing them to be most common in the northern and southern regions. Cheetahs are apex predators for smaller herbivores such as ibex, hares, gazelle, and sheep, species that larger predators kill less often. There kills both support scavengers and are often kleptoparasited, leading to cheetahs hunting more often than other predators. There are many places with suitable prey populations and habitat for the species including, At-Taysiyah Natural Reserve, Saja Umm Ar-Rimth Natural Reserve, Jabal Aja Protected Area, Samhan Nature Reserve, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, and possibly the Negev. The issue would be a founder population. Recent mummified remains show that the original population of the peninsula was genetically closest to the northwestern subspecies, and more modern populations where of the Asiatic subspecies. However, both of these subspecies are critically endangered, and could likely not be used in these reintroductions, so southeastern cheetahs would likely need to be used, the same subspecies reintroduced to India.

Moving up in size, we have the peninsulas historic apex predator, the lion. Lions were known to historically have been found in the Levant, but this study greatly expanded their range. Using petroglyphs and historical reports, they found evidence of the species in the mountains of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, as well as coastal and montane Oman and the UAE. They are a keystone species for a few reasons. Due to hunting in prides, lions hunt much larger prey than other large predators. They can hunt medium sized prey like onager and oryx, as well as larger herbivores like camels and aurochs, allowing for population control on these larger species. Due to also living in larger groups, they also have to hunt more to keep the pride fed, causing them to hunt more than many other predators. They usually wont feed on the entire large herbivore, leaving large carcasses for scavengers such as jackals and vultures. They likely would be needed to control the population of larger herbivores like aurochs, dromedary, and ass which would be more rarely targeted by larger predators. There are already plans to return the species to the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, but there are other regions they could be reintroduced. If prey populations are increased, they could return to the Negev, At-Taysiyah Natural Reserve, Shada Mountain Reserve, Majami'al-Hadb Reserve, Nafud al-ʽUrayq Natural Reserve, Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area, Al-Tubayq Natural Reserve, Asir National Park, Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, and Samhan Nature Reserve. The Asiatic subspecies is the one that once inhabited the peninsula, so they would be the most logical to reintroduce. Currently, Asiatic lions are restricted to Gujarat in India. Despite an order from the Indian supreme court, the local Gujarat government refuses to give up any lions, halting any reintroductions in Asia. Thankfully, captive individuals exist in multiple zoos, which could provide a founder population for these reintroductions.

Finally for large cats are the leopard. Currently, the Arabian subspecies is critically endangered and only exists in a few parts of Oman, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, despite this, many regions are suitable for the species and could see them return. They are a keystone species for numerous regions. First, as apex predators they help control prey populations. Being the smallest leopard subspecies, weighing only around 65 pounds, they prefer medium sized ungulates like gazelle and ibex, helping to maintain their populations. Their kills feed scavengers and decay bringing nutrients into the soil. The species is nearly extinct in most of their range, but captive breeding projects are bringing their numbers up. They could theoretically be reintroduced to the Negev, At-Taysiyah Natural Reserve, Shada Mountain Reserve, Majami'al-Hadb Reserve, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, Nafud al-ʽUrayq Natural Reserve, Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area, Al-Tubayq Natural Reserve, Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, Asir National Park, Samhan Nature Reserve and Yemen.

Finally for mammals, are another species still present, the gray wolf. Arabian wolves, the subspecies native to the peninsula is by far the smallest living wolf, averaging around 50 pounds, making it hard to label them as apex predators. Despite this, they are still crucial in maintaining the populations of small ungulates like gazelle and young ibex. Being social animals, they have to hunt relatively often, causing them to kill more often than other carnivores. The species kills also feed scavengers and fertilizes soil. The species was once found in coastal and montane regions across the peninsula, but is now restricted to southern Oman, the Negev, Saudi Arabia, and possibly Yemen. They could return to many regions including most of the western Saudi Arabian mountains and the Hajar Mountains. 

Next are common ostrich. The species once was found in two distinct populations, one in the Levant and surrounding area, and another in the southern mountains. They are important to local ecosystems for multiple reasons. They are major seed dispersers, with some species evolving to germinate within ostrich dung. They feed on shrubby vegetations creating more open habitats. They are also a perfect prey item for cheetahs, leopards, wolves, lions, and even jackal. The North African subspecies has already been reintroduced to multiple regions, although they could also return to the Negev, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, Yemen, Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve, the Hajar Mountains, Shada Mountain Reserve, Asir National Park, Harrat al-Harrah Protected Area, and Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve.

Finally, we reach the species the study considered questionable. These species appeared in rock art, but no archeological find where found, leading to the species native status being questioned. It is possible, especially given their rarity in rock art, that these species were painted after being seen elsewhere, like Egypt, or have even been misinterpreted by the scientists when they were meant to depict something else. These species include African bush elephant, zebra who were known from the region during the African Humid Period, Warthog, giraffe, black rhinoceros, cape buffalo, wildebeest, and addax. If these species are proven to be native to the peninsula, then their return is paramount as almost all of them are ecosystem engineers, although more research is needed before jumping to conclusions.

Finally, we have the issues regarding rewilding Arabia in the first place. You obviously have the universal issues with large carnivores being controversial, but there are other more specific issues in the region. First is the general lack of stability in many of these nations. There is the Israel-Palestine conflict in the Levant, which often involves Lebanon, and the Yemeni Civil War I touched upon earlier. These conflicts make any form of ecological protection very difficult, especially reintroductions. The other issue has to do with the desertification of the peninsula. Climate change and livestock grazing has been slowly drying out the peninsula, and many of the once shrubby or grassy regions these species once inhabited are now true deserts. However, there is a solution. The Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area (image 17) in Saudi Arabia consists of a 220,000 ha fenced in region without livestock grazing. The removal of livestock, and reintroduction of native herbivores like oryx and gazelle has caused a major transformation in the region. Arid grasslands have now grown across much of the reserve, transforming it from a relatively low productivity desert to a dry savanna like ecosystem with abundant plant life. The removal of intensive livestock grazing from much of the peninsula, which is already slowly happening due to increased urbanization, alongside the return of more desert tolerant native herbivores could allow shrubland and steppe habitats to once again cover much of the peninsula, allowing for wildlife to return again. The presence of flora also increases moisture levels, allowing for even more greenery to return, theoretically causing a greening effect across the peninsulas more habitable regions that could fight back against climate change.

Overall, restoring Arabia is a complicated venture with many benefits. Saudi Arabia has already realized the potential for ecotourism, and other countries may follow, encouraging them to return extinct wildlife. So, what do you think? Could the Arabian Peninsula ever be returned to its former glory or is it too late.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfswwt,"Restoring the wildlife of Arabia 2 The Arabian Peninsula sits at the crossroads of the Palearctic and Afrotropics, creating a unique ecosystem that blends species characteristic of both regions. Historically, the region was home to a much wider array of megafauna than in the modern day. The 2024 paper titled The Lost Large Mammals of Arabia attempts to map out this once vibrant ecosystem. By studying fossil and subfossil remains, as well as petroglyphs they mapped out the historical ranges of many now extinct species on the peninsula. It is an incredibly interesting read, and I implore you to read it yourself, it is worth it. I have attached the paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389435666_The_Lost_Large_Mammals_of_Arabia), but I will be going over many of the major points in this thread. I will go over what these findings could mean for rewilding, as well as other species not focused on in the study, but still have great rewilding potential. Now, many of these species had finds from the humid period roughly 7,000 years ago, when the Arabian peninsula was much greener than it is. It is considered likely by the paper that many of these species would have seen severe population declines as the region dried out but would have survived in more humid montane areas without human pressures. So, let's get started.

First, we have the aurochs. If you weren't aware, true aurochs have been extinct since the early 18th century at the latest, but probably since the mid 17th century. However, captive breeding programs have bred cattle, their modern decedents into forms that closely resemble the extinct species who have been used in numerous rewilding projects to date. Historically, it was well known that aurochs once inhabited the Levant, however, findings in the paper greatly expand the species historic range. They highlight archeological finds and petroglyphs, as well as potential historic records from the 3rd and 5th centuries that show the species was once present in the mountains of Yemen, and possibly the coastal mountains of Saudi Arabia, although not certainly. These mountains average 30 inches of rain a year, allowing for shrublands, grasslands, and even forests to persist in this region. Aurochs are a keystone species that completely shape the landscape around them. Their grazing and browsing habits remove trees and create a mixed landscape that greatly increases biodiversity. Grasslands grazed by the species create great nesting habitat for many bird species, and their fur makes for perfect nest lining. Smaller herbivores like gazelle stick near aurochs for protection against larger predators. They are major seed dispersers both through there feces and seeds that stick to their fur. There wallows create sand baths for birds and nesting sites for reptiles and allow pioneer plants to grow. They pave game trails that hundreds of other species will use for transportation. Birds such as magpies feed on parasites off of the cattle, benefiting both species. There feces act as fertilizer and provide food and nesting locations for many insect species. Once deceased, there huge bodies support thousands of scavengers from boar to beetles to vultures. They could also be large prey animals for future lion reintroductions. Now there is a very obvious issue with this region. Yemen has been in the midst of a civil war since 2014, and this entire region is currently under the control of the Houthis. This makes Yemen no place for wildlife reintroductions, and it is certainly not the priority of any of the people in the country. However, if the nation ever does stabilize, aurochs could return to the region. The other region they historically inhabited is the Levant, which would also be a difficult reintroduction. Once again, this region is very politically tense and isn't really place for rewilding. Furthermore, this region is very densely populated, with only small, isolated pockets of nature remaining. Theoretically though, the mountains of Lebanon could possibly support wild individuals. However, there is a better option. Semi-wild individuals could certainly be established across the nation, similar to what is going on in much of Europe. This could provide the same ecological impacts of a wild population, without having the same issues.

The next species is the lesser kudu, which is a very unique species. The study found petroglyphs from the humid period in northern Saudi Arabia. Horns of two individuals were found in Yemen and Saudi Arabia in the 1960s, suggesting that a small, remnant population survived in southwest Arabia well into modern times. They could be very beneficial to local environments. Being browsers, they clear woody shrubs which allows other plants to grow, creating richer floral communities. Their dung also is known to spread seeds. Their dung also could bring added nutrients to very dry soil, improving its productivity. Finally, ranging between 120-250 pounds, they would make the perfect sized meals for leopards, wolves, and lions. They could likely survive in Yemen, if the nation ever stabilizes, or multiple regions of southwestern Saudi Arabia. Parks like Shada Mountain Reserve and Asir National Park could easily support populations of the species.

Next are wild goat. The species was known to have once lived in the Levant, and sighting were made in the UAE during the 1960s. The study identified petroglyphs likely showing the species from the UAE and coastal mountains of Saudi Arabia. They are browsers and help maintain plant communities in their native habitats. Their dung also fertilizes the soil and spreads seeds. They also are a perfect sized meal for leopards and wolves. Their ecological importance could be questioned when many of these regions also have Nubian ibex, but every species does count towards biodiversity. They could likely survive in the mountains of Lebanon and Yemen, as well as many Saudi Reserves like Shada Mountain Reserve, Asir National Park, Jabal Aja Protected Area, Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, and the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve. Overall, the species might not be the most important to local ecosystems but would likely still benefit them.

Next are aoudad, also known as barbary sheep. The species historically inhabited the Negev Desert. Their browsing and feeding habits increase plant diversity in their desert habitats. Their feces also spread seeds and fertilize the soil. Finally, they are a perfectly sized prey item for lions, leopards, cheetahs, and wolves. As a vulnerable species, establishing a new population in the protected regions of the Negev could be beneficial for the species. 

Finally for the bovids are hartebeest. They were once common in the southern Levant. Their grazing habitats prefer low quality grasses other species don't often feed on, benefiting the vegetation communities of their habitat. By removing these less palatable grasses, it allows smaller more nutritious grasses to grow which other herbivores prefer, boosting their numbers. Their dung also brings nutrients to the soil. Finally, they would be a great food source for wolves and lions. They could likely do relatively well in the Negev, which has already seen the reintroduction of oryx and onager.

Next are the largest animal native to the peninsula, the dromedary. Wild dromedaries were once abundant across the Arabian Peninsula, with the study finding the species to have been most common along the coast of the Persian Gulf, although they would have ranged across the peninsula. Being so large, they were major ecosystem engineers. As browsers of thorny scrubs, they prevent them from becoming dominant in an ecosystem, allowing plants favored by other herbivores like oryx to grow. They are known to travel long distances, spreading seeds as they go to distant oasis. Their feces also distributed fertilizer across their range. Finally, standing 7 feet at the shoulder and weighing up to 1,500 pounds, they are a perfect large meal for large carnivores like lions. The species has been extinct in the wild for thousands of years, but millions of domesticated individuals exist, who could be used for a reintroduction. They could return to numerous desert reserves like Shada Mountain Reserve, Asir National Park, Jabal Aja Protected Area, Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, the Negev, Al Marmoom, Al Saleel National Park, the Arabian Oryx sanctuary and many more. They could honestly return to most of the peninsula and bring much needed biodiversity to the region.

Finally for the artiodactyls are red deer, who historically inhabited the Levant. They are a keystone species to their forest habitats and are necessary for them to be healthy. First, their browsing and grazes opens forests and create mosaic habitats, greatly increasing local biodiversity. Their feces fertilized the forest and spread seeds. They are also a perfectly sized prey item for wolves. The species could likely due well in the mountains of Lebanon.

Moving on the perissodactyls, we have onager. They are mixed feeders and prefer tougher shrubs and grasses, allowing softer plants to grow which many other herbivores prefer. Their grazing also creates a mosaic of ungrazed and grazed regions, increasing local biodiversity. They are also known to dig for groundwater, creating watering holes that benefit thousands of species. Their dung spreads seeds and fertilizes soil. They are also the perfect sized prey for lions and wolves. The species was historically known from the northern half of the peninsula, although the study found a fossil tooth and possible 4th century report of the species from Yemen, however, due to the distance between Yemen and the rest of their known range the study says we should use restraint in labeling them as a native species of Yemen, so I am only going to stick to their known range. The species has already been reintroduced to the Negev, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, and the Shaumari Nature Reserve, although there are many other places they could return including Nafud al-ʽUrayq Natural Reserve, Harrat al-Harrah Protected Area, Al-Tubayq Natural Reserve, and Jabal Aja Protected Area.

Next are African wild ass. Historically, the species was not known to have ranged into the Arabian Peninsula, however, this study found archeological remains and petroglyphs in multiple regions. The species seems to have had a distribution hugging the coast of Yemen and the Gulf States, as well as being found in the Levant. Ecologically, they would fill nearly the exact same niche as the onager, however in the southern parts of the Peninsula. The species is critically endangered, so any new populations would greatly benefit the species. They could return to the mountains of Yemen (if it stabilizes), Al Saleel National Park in Oman, and Wadi Wurayah National Park in the United Arab Emirates. Their return to the Levant is less certain. Onager already live there, meaning they don't need to fill their niche there, and could risk hybridization between the two species, so keeping them from the Levant is probably a good idea.

Finally, for perissodactyls is the wild horse. The species was once found through the non-desert parts of the Levant. They are a keystone species for a few reasons. Unlike ruminants, there grazing habits strip most of the grass, leaving behind just the nutrient rich stems which small mammals like gazelle and hares like to feed on. Their feces both spread seeds and support fungi and insects. They strip bark off dead trees opening up woodlands benefiting many species on the forest floor. As they graze, insects flee making it easier for insectivorous birds to hunt. They also provide huge carcasses for scavengers once they die. Their grazing also causes more open vegetation lowering fire risks. They also are also the perfect size for predators such as lions and wolves. They also dig for roots and roll creating bare patches that benefit reptiles and insects and allow pioneer plants to grow. The species also feed on dead plants during the winter, allowing for new species to move in when the snow melts in more montane regions. They also dig up snow to graze, exposing vegetation for other species to eat. Semi wild herds, like what are seen in much of Europe could likely be established in many parts of the Levant, especially in the mountains of Lebanon.

Starting with carnivores we have cheetah. The species once was found across the entire peninsula, with the studies showing them to be most common in the northern and southern regions. Cheetahs are apex predators for smaller herbivores such as ibex, hares, gazelle, and sheep, species that larger predators kill less often. There kills both support scavengers and are often kleptoparasited, leading to cheetahs hunting more often than other predators. There are many places with suitable prey populations and habitat for the species including, At-Taysiyah Natural Reserve, Saja Umm Ar-Rimth Natural Reserve, Jabal Aja Protected Area, Samhan Nature Reserve, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, and possibly the Negev. The issue would be a founder population. Recent mummified remains show that the original population of the peninsula was genetically closest to the northwestern subspecies, and more modern populations where of the Asiatic subspecies. However, both of these subspecies are critically endangered, and could likely not be used in these reintroductions, so southeastern cheetahs would likely need to be used, the same subspecies reintroduced to India.

Moving up in size, we have the peninsulas historic apex predator, the lion. Lions were known to historically have been found in the Levant, but this study greatly expanded their range. Using petroglyphs and historical reports, they found evidence of the species in the mountains of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, as well as coastal and montane Oman and the UAE. They are a keystone species for a few reasons. Due to hunting in prides, lions hunt much larger prey than other large predators. They can hunt medium sized prey like onager and oryx, as well as larger herbivores like camels and aurochs, allowing for population control on these larger species. Due to also living in larger groups, they also have to hunt more to keep the pride fed, causing them to hunt more than many other predators. They usually wont feed on the entire large herbivore, leaving large carcasses for scavengers such as jackals and vultures. They likely would be needed to control the population of larger herbivores like aurochs, dromedary, and ass which would be more rarely targeted by larger predators. There are already plans to return the species to the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, but there are other regions they could be reintroduced. If prey populations are increased, they could return to the Negev, At-Taysiyah Natural Reserve, Shada Mountain Reserve, Majami'al-Hadb Reserve, Nafud al-ʽUrayq Natural Reserve, Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area, Al-Tubayq Natural Reserve, Asir National Park, Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, and Samhan Nature Reserve. The Asiatic subspecies is the one that once inhabited the peninsula, so they would be the most logical to reintroduce. Currently, Asiatic lions are restricted to Gujarat in India. Despite an order from the Indian supreme court, the local Gujarat government refuses to give up any lions, halting any reintroductions in Asia. Thankfully, captive individuals exist in multiple zoos, which could provide a founder population for these reintroductions.

Finally for large cats are the leopard. Currently, the Arabian subspecies is critically endangered and only exists in a few parts of Oman, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, despite this, many regions are suitable for the species and could see them return. They are a keystone species for numerous regions. First, as apex predators they help control prey populations. Being the smallest leopard subspecies, weighing only around 65 pounds, they prefer medium sized ungulates like gazelle and ibex, helping to maintain their populations. Their kills feed scavengers and decay bringing nutrients into the soil. The species is nearly extinct in most of their range, but captive breeding projects are bringing their numbers up. They could theoretically be reintroduced to the Negev, At-Taysiyah Natural Reserve, Shada Mountain Reserve, Majami'al-Hadb Reserve, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, Nafud al-ʽUrayq Natural Reserve, Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area, Al-Tubayq Natural Reserve, Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve, Asir National Park, Samhan Nature Reserve and Yemen.

Finally for mammals, are another species still present, the gray wolf. Arabian wolves, the subspecies native to the peninsula is by far the smallest living wolf, averaging around 50 pounds, making it hard to label them as apex predators. Despite this, they are still crucial in maintaining the populations of small ungulates like gazelle and young ibex. Being social animals, they have to hunt relatively often, causing them to kill more often than other carnivores. The species kills also feed scavengers and fertilizes soil. The species was once found in coastal and montane regions across the peninsula, but is now restricted to southern Oman, the Negev, Saudi Arabia, and possibly Yemen. They could return to many regions including most of the western Saudi Arabian mountains and the Hajar Mountains. 

Next are common ostrich. The species once was found in two distinct populations, one in the Levant and surrounding area, and another in the southern mountains. They are important to local ecosystems for multiple reasons. They are major seed dispersers, with some species evolving to germinate within ostrich dung. They feed on shrubby vegetations creating more open habitats. They are also a perfect prey item for cheetahs, leopards, wolves, lions, and even jackal. The North African subspecies has already been reintroduced to multiple regions, although they could also return to the Negev, Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, Yemen, Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve, the Hajar Mountains, Shada Mountain Reserve, Asir National Park, Harrat al-Harrah Protected Area, and Wadi Turabah Nature Reserve.

Finally, we reach the species the study considered questionable. These species appeared in rock art, but no archeological find where found, leading to the species native status being questioned. It is possible, especially given their rarity in rock art, that these species were painted after being seen elsewhere, like Egypt, or have even been misinterpreted by the scientists when they were meant to depict something else. These species include African bush elephant, zebra who were known from the region during the African Humid Period, Warthog, giraffe, black rhinoceros, cape buffalo, wildebeest, and addax. If these species are proven to be native to the peninsula, then their return is paramount as almost all of them are ecosystem engineers, although more research is needed before jumping to conclusions.

Finally, we have the issues regarding rewilding Arabia in the first place.

the negev desert their browsing and feeding habits increase plant diversity in their desert habitats their feces also spread seeds and fertilize the soil finally they are a perfectly sized prey item for lions leopards cheetahs and wolves as a vulnerable species establishing a new population in the protected regions of the negev could be beneficial for the species finally for the bovids are hartebeest they were once common in the southern levant their grazing habitats prefer low quality grasses other species don t often feed on benefiting the vegetation communities of their habitat by removing these less palatable grasses it allows smaller more nutritious grasses to grow which other herbivores prefer boosting their numbers their dung also brings nutrients to the soil finally they would be a great food source for wolves and lions they could likely do relatively well in the negev which has already seen the reintroduction of oryx and onager next are the largest animal native to the peninsula the dromedary wild dromedaries were once abundant across the arabian peninsula with the study finding the species to have been most common along the coast of the persian gulf although they would have ranged across the peninsula being so large they were major ecosystem engineers as browsers of thorny scrubs they prevent them from becoming dominant in an ecosystem allowing plants favored by other herbivores like oryx to grow they are known to travel long distances spreading seeds as they go to distant oasis their feces also distributed fertilizer across their range finally standing feet at the shoulder and weighing up to pounds they are a perfect large meal for large carnivores like lions the species has been extinct in the wild for thousands of years but millions of domesticated individuals exist who could be used for a reintroduction they could return to numerous desert reserves like shada mountain reserve asir national park jabal aja protected area wadi turabah nature reserve prince mohammed bin salman royal reserve the negev al marmoom al saleel national park the arabian oryx sanctuary and many more they could honestly return to most of the peninsula and bring much needed biodiversity to the region finally for the artiodactyls are red deer who historically inhabited the levant they are a keystone species to their forest habitats and are necessary for them to be healthy first their browsing and grazes opens forests and create mosaic habitats greatly increasing local biodiversity their feces fertilized the forest and spread seeds they are also a perfectly sized prey item for wolves the species could likely due well in the mountains of lebanon moving on the perissodactyls we have onager they are mixed feeders and prefer tougher shrubs and grasses allowing softer plants to grow which many other herbivores prefer their grazing also creates a mosaic of ungrazed and grazed regions increasing local biodiversity they are also known to dig for groundwater creating watering holes that benefit thousands of species their dung spreads seeds and fertilizes soil they are also the perfect sized prey for lions and wolves the species was historically known from the northern half of the peninsula although the study found a fossil tooth and possible th century report of the species from yemen however due to the distance between yemen and the rest of their known range the study says we should use restraint in labeling them as a native species of yemen so i am only going to stick to their known range the species has already been reintroduced to the negev prince mohammed bin salman royal reserve and the shaumari nature reserve although there are many other places they could return including nafud al urayq natural reserve harrat al harrah protected area al tubayq natural reserve and jabal aja protected area next are african wild ass historically the species was not known to have ranged into the arabian peninsula however this study found archeological remains and petroglyphs in multiple regions the species seems to have had a distribution hugging the coast of yemen and the gulf states as well as being found in the levant ecologically they would fill nearly the exact same niche as the onager however in the southern parts of the peninsula the species is critically endangered so any new populations would greatly benefit the species they could return to the mountains of yemen if it stabilizes al saleel national park in oman and wadi wurayah national park in the united arab emirates their return to the levant is less certain onager already live there meaning they don t need to fill their niche there and could risk hybridization between the two species so keeping them from the levant is probably a good idea finally for perissodactyls is the wild horse the species was once found through the non desert parts of the levant they are a keystone species for a few reasons unlike ruminants there grazing habits strip most of the grass leaving behind just the nutrient rich stems which small mammals like gazelle and hares like to feed on their feces both spread seeds and support fungi and insects they strip bark off dead trees opening up woodlands benefiting many species on the forest floor as they graze insects flee making it easier for insectivorous birds to hunt they also provide huge carcasses for scavengers once they die their grazing also causes more open vegetation lowering fire risks they also are also the perfect size for predators such as lions and wolves they also dig for roots and roll creating bare patches that benefit reptiles and insects and allow pioneer plants to grow the species also feed on dead plants during the winter allowing for new species to move in when the snow melts in more montane regions they also dig up snow to graze exposing vegetation for other species to eat semi wild herds like what are seen in much of europe could likely be established in many parts of the levant especially in the mountains of lebanon starting with carnivores we have cheetah the species once was found across the entire peninsula with the studies showing them to be most common in the northern and southern regions cheetahs are apex predators for smaller herbivores such as ibex hares gazelle and sheep species that larger predators kill less often there kills both support scavengers and are often kleptoparasited leading to cheetahs hunting more often than other predators there are many places with suitable prey populations and habitat for the species including at taysiyah natural reserve saja umm ar rimth natural reserve jabal aja protected area samhan nature reserve prince mohammed bin salman royal reserve and possibly the negev the issue would be a founder population recent mummified remains show that the original population of the peninsula was genetically closest to the northwestern subspecies and more modern populations where of the asiatic subspecies however both of these subspecies are critically endangered and could likely not be used in these reintroductions so southeastern cheetahs would likely need to be used the same subspecies reintroduced to india moving up in size we have the peninsulas historic apex predator the lion lions were known to historically have been found in the levant but this study greatly expanded their range using petroglyphs and historical reports they found evidence of the species in the mountains of saudi arabia and yemen as well as coastal and montane oman and the uae they are a keystone species for a few reasons due to hunting in prides lions hunt much larger prey than other large predators they can hunt medium sized prey like onager and oryx as well as larger herbivores like camels and aurochs allowing for population control on these larger species due to also living in larger groups they also have to hunt more to keep the pride fed causing them to hunt more than many other predators they usually wont feed on the entire large herbivore leaving large carcasses for scavengers such as jackals and vultures they likely would be needed to control the population of larger herbivores like aurochs dromedary and ass which would be more rarely targeted by larger predators there are already plans to return the species to the prince mohammed bin salman royal reserve but there are other regions they could be reintroduced if prey populations are increased they could return to the negev at taysiyah natural reserve shada mountain reserve majami al hadb reserve nafud al urayq natural reserve mahazat as sayd protected area al tubayq natural reserve asir national park wadi turabah nature reserve and samhan nature reserve the asiatic subspecies is the one that once inhabited the peninsula so they would be the most logical to reintroduce currently asiatic lions are restricted to gujarat in india despite an order from the indian supreme court the local gujarat government refuses to give up any lions halting any reintroductions in asia thankfully captive individuals exist in multiple zoos which could provide a founder population for these reintroductions finally for large cats are the leopard currently the arabian subspecies is critically endangered and only exists in a few parts of oman yemen and saudi arabia despite this many regions are suitable for the species and could see them return they are a keystone species for numerous regions first as apex predators they help control prey populations being the smallest leopard subspecies weighing only around pounds they prefer medium sized ungulates like gazelle and ibex helping to maintain their populations their kills feed scavengers and decay bringing nutrients into the soil the species is nearly extinct in most of their range but captive breeding projects are bringing their numbers up they could theoretically be reintroduced to the negev at taysiyah natural reserve shada mountain reserve majami al hadb reserve prince mohammed bin salman royal reserve nafud al urayq natural reserve mahazat as sayd protected area al tubayq natural reserve wadi turabah nature reserve asir national park samhan nature reserve and yemen finally for mammals are another species still present the gray wolf arabian wolves the subspecies native to the peninsula is by far the smallest living wolf averaging around pounds making it hard to label them as apex predators despite this they are still crucial in maintaining the populations of small ungulates like gazelle and young ibex being social animals they have to hunt relatively often causing them to kill more often than other carnivores the species kills also feed scavengers and fertilizes soil the species was once found in coastal and montane regions across the peninsula but is now restricted to southern oman the negev saudi arabia and possibly yemen they could return to many regions including most of the western saudi arabian mountains and the hajar mountains next are common ostrich the species once was found in two distinct populations one in the levant and surrounding area and another in the southern mountains they are important to local ecosystems for multiple reasons they are major seed dispersers with some species evolving to germinate within ostrich dung they feed on shrubby vegetations creating more open habitats they are also a perfect prey item for cheetahs leopards wolves lions and even jackal the north african subspecies has already been reintroduced to multiple regions although they could also return to the negev prince mohammed bin salman royal reserve yemen jabal samhan nature reserve the hajar mountains shada mountain reserve asir national park harrat al harrah protected area and wadi turabah nature reserve finally we reach the species the study considered questionable these species appeared in rock art but no archeological find where found leading to the species native status being questioned it is possible especially given their rarity in rock art that these species were painted after being seen elsewhere like egypt or have even been misinterpreted by the scientists when they were meant to depict something else these species include african bush elephant zebra who were known from the region during the african humid period warthog giraffe black rhinoceros cape buffalo wildebeest and addax if these species are proven to be native to the peninsula then their return is paramount as almost all of them are ecosystem engineers although more research is needed before jumping to conclusions finally we have the issues regarding rewilding arabia in the first place you obviously have the universal issues with large carnivores being controversial but there are other more specific issues in the region first is the general lack of stability in many of these nations there is the israel palestine conflict in the levant which often involves lebanon and the yemeni civil war i touched upon earlier these conflicts make any form of ecological protection very difficult especially reintroductions the other issue has to do with the desertification of the peninsula climate change and livestock grazing has been slowly drying out the peninsula and many of the once shrubby or grassy regions these species once inhabited are now true deserts however there is a solution the mahazat as sayd protected area image in saudi arabia consists of a ha fenced in region without livestock grazing the removal of livestock and reintroduction of native herbivores like oryx and gazelle has caused a major transformation in the region arid grasslands have now grown across much of the reserve transforming it from a relatively low productivity desert to a dry savanna like ecosystem with abundant plant life the removal of intensive livestock grazing from much of the peninsula which is already slowly happening due to increased urbanization alongside the return of more desert tolerant native herbivores could allow shrubland and steppe habitats to once again cover much of the peninsula allowing for wildlife to return again the presence of flora also increases moisture levels allowing for even more greenery to return theoretically causing a greening effect across the peninsulas more habitable regions that could fight back against climate change overall restoring arabia is a complicated venture with many benefits saudi arabia has already realized the potential for ecotourism and other countries may follow encouraging them to return extinct wildlife so what do you think could the arabian peninsula ever be returned to its former glory or is it too late,68,2026-01-17 23:54:47,Pro-India,0.291,neutral,1,True,2026-01-17 23:54:47

I saw Rancho’s school, Pangong Lake — all those 3 Idiots places we grew up romanticising.

Today, after coming back home, I randomly rewatched 3 Idiots.

As a kid, this movie just felt funny and motivational.

Watching it now, it hit very differently.

Then I remembered something:

the real person behind Rancho — Sonam Wangchuk —

whose school I literally just visited…

is in jail.

And I honestly paused and thought —

why exactly?

What crime did this man commit?

Inventing things?

Helping Ladakh deal with climate change?

Talking about education?

Or worst of all — peacefully protesting?

Because apparently, in our country:

Rapists can get bail

People accused of murder roam free

Corrupt individuals contest elections

But if you ask questions politely,

or say “please protect our land and environment,”

you go straight to jail. No bail.

Great priorities.

Today I didn’t feel angry —

I felt embarrassed.

Embarrassed that someone who genuinely served the country, created real value, offered solutions, and brought global recognition…

is treated like a threat.

And as I grow older, one thing is becoming clearer —

now I understand why so many people want to leave India.

It’s not always about money or lifestyle.

Sometimes, it’s just exhaustion with the system.

15,Lack of Western protests in solidarity with Iranian demonstrators,1qfs91p,PERSIAN,21,21,2026-01-17 23:25:55,Born_Ad_6119,"I've spent the last 3 weeks in a certain political organization that has, without success, tried to coordinate a rally in support of the Iranian democracy protestors. Here's the reason why that push failed: 

**1. There is no palatable action for the US to take in Iran (that the US hasn't already taken)**

The vast majority of Americans do not want intervention in Iran, at 70% as per Quinnipiac (compared to only 18% support). This is constant throughout all party lines and political groups.  
So there isn't anything to protest; supporters of Democracy in Iran have no policy for the government to change. I see many posts saying ""heh.. where are \[usually pro-Palestine activists but really any protest group in the US can fit here\] when it comes to Iran.."", insinuating that there's some kind of ideological link between XYZ protest group and the Iranian regime. Regardless of whether the latter is true, the fact that there is nothing to protest is 100 times more significant in determining whether people come out and rally. Many groups will write it off as a waste of time and organization regardless of their ideological support.

**2. Winter break**

This is another big one. Oftentimes protests regarding foreign events or intervention occur on College campuses. Most college students are/were at home for Winter break. Currently most protests are about ICE, or other domestic squabbles, which are more palatable to protest for to non-Student populations in America.

**3. Entrenched Monarchist hostility**

This is probably going to be the most controversial of the 4 points I bring up.   
In the US, whether due to hostility to any other group of Iranians, socioeconomic factors, or (most likely the biggest factor) nonexistent planning/coordination amongst Leftist groups in this sector, the Monarchists have a virtual monopoly in many areas over Iranian pro-democracy rallies. This is detrimental for two reasons: 

**a) Ideological differences**

The Monarchists and most youth protestors are diametrically opposed. Recent actions taken by the Shah include the creation of the ""Make Iran great again"" slogan and advocacy for US intervention in Iran. Many Monarchist protests are speckled with Israeli flags. The current view of Monarchists in the US is as a block of pro-Trump, pro-Israel fanatics, not very palatable to most organized protest groups. 

**b) Overt hostility**

When we requested a ban on foreign flags at an Austin rally so that there wouldn't be ideological differences between monarchists and non-monarchists, it was rejected. See below for an article on that protest (or one closely affiliated), and spot the flags used. [https://www.fox7austin.com/news/austin-protesters-state-capitol-call-president-trump-help-iran](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/austin-protesters-state-capitol-call-president-trump-help-iran)  
Other talks before were cut off when someone kept sending death threats to ""Hamas terrorists"" while sustaining incoherent ramblings about the Shah and Iran (but mostly Israel, I would doubt the guy was an Iranian but I digress). At the above protest, a few non-monarchist protestors who did go were immediately alienated by random squabbles or chants about unrelated right-wing cause celebres. There are also fears of hostility or violence. Monarchists have indeed acted out in violence against non-Monarchists, including in Texas and the US (though the below is from Toronto): [https://x.com/ArazNews\_org/status/2010616524420059586](https://x.com/ArazNews_org/status/2010616524420059586). Anti-encampment violence during 2024's campus protests prominently featured Monarchists alongside Israel-supporters in many areas, isolating pretty much every youth activist group from any affiliated cause.  
Once again, I don't doubt that a significant portion of these people aren't Iranian, but it certainly causes a rift. 	

**4. Leftist solidarity with the regime**

Lots of leftist groups are more anti-America than actually leftist, leading to random bullshit hypocrisies which have been made clear by recent events. They don't make up the majority of any wider political cause, movement, or front (at least not here), but this still means less resources to organize.		

**--**

In the last few days, more diversity in political thought has indeed begun to rally for Iranian democracy, so it hasn't been limited to Monarchists as much as in early Jan, through which we saw an opportunity to participate, but now it seems like the current moment for pro-democracy-in-Iran rallies in the US has dissipated altogether, except to some of the more dedicated portions of the Iranian diaspora.

18,Evolution of Knowledge Systems in Early Tamil Literature and Culture,1qfpb0w,IndicKnowledgeSystems,3,0,2026-01-17 21:24:37,Positive_Hat_5414,"

The exploration of knowledge production in Tamil language, literature, and culture reveals a rich tapestry of intellectual development that spans from the early historical period to the transitional phases influenced by religious and social changes. This journey begins with the Sangam poems, which capture the essence of early Tamil society through themes of love and war, and extends to grammatical treatises, didactic works, and emerging scientific insights. The foundational texts not only preserved linguistic norms but also embedded social, ethical, and environmental knowledge, reflecting the needs of a society transitioning from tribal structures to more organized formations. Influenced by indigenous traditions and external elements from Jainism, Buddhism, and Sanskrit sources, these knowledge systems laid the groundwork for Tamil intellectual heritage. By examining the key traditions mentioned in historical analyses, we can appreciate how early Tamils systematized their understanding of language, morality, medicine, mathematics, and philosophy.



The knowledge traditions in early Tamil culture can be categorized as follows:



1. Grammatical and Linguistic Tradition  

2. Poetic and Literary Tradition  

3. Didactic and Ethical Tradition  

4. Medical Tradition  

5. Mathematical and Astronomical Tradition  

6. Philosophical and Religious Tradition  



Each of these traditions contributed uniquely to the growth of knowledge, often intertwining with socio-economic shifts and religious influences. Below, we delve into each in detail, exploring their origins, key texts, methodologies, and impacts on Tamil society.



1. Grammatical and Linguistic Tradition



The grammatical and linguistic tradition in Tamil represents one of the earliest formalized knowledge systems, aimed at standardizing language for literary and communicative purposes. At its core is the \*Tolkāppiyam\*, recognized as the oldest extant work on Tamil grammar, dating variably from the 2nd century BC to the 9th century AD, with recent epigraphic evidence supporting a 2nd-century date based on its alignment with early Tamil Brāhmi inscriptions. This text is not merely a grammatical manual but a comprehensive framework that established the basis for Tamil linguistics, influencing subsequent works and serving as a guide to interpreting ancient literature.



The \*Tolkāppiyam\* is structured into three main sections: \*Eluttatikāram\* (orthography or phonology), \*Sollatikāram\* (etymology, morphology, and syntax), and \*Poruḷatikāram\* (semantics, poetics, and conventions). This tripartite division, comprising 27 chapters and 1,612 sūtras, reflects a methodical approach to language analysis. The \*Eluttatikāram\* deals with the sounds and letters of Tamil, categorizing them into vowels, consonants, and their combinations, emphasizing phonetic accuracy essential for oral transmission in a pre-institutional educational setup. This section underscores the importance of precise articulation, which was crucial in a society where knowledge was passed orally from teacher to student.



The \*Sollatikāram\* explores word formation, including roots, suffixes, and syntactic rules, systematizing how words convey meaning in context. It addresses case endings, verb conjugations, and nominal derivations, providing rules that ensure clarity and consistency in expression. This morphological focus highlights the tradition's emphasis on cognitive development, prioritizing intellectual outcomes over rote learning. Tolkāppiyar, the attributed author, drew inspiration from an earlier non-extant work, \*Akattiyam\*, attributed to the sage Agastya, suggesting a lineage of grammatical scholarship.



The most innovative aspect is the \*Poruḷatikāram\*, which interprets meaning through literary conventions, psychology, and social norms. It classifies themes into \*akaṁ\* (interior, love) and \*puraṁ\* (exterior, war or public life), linking them to \*tiṇai\*—eco-zones that integrate geography, environment, and human behavior. The seven \*tiṇai\* (kurinci for hills, mullai for forests, marutam for plains, neytal for coasts, pālai for deserts, plus two additional for mismatched love) represent situational contexts, blending linguistics with ecology. For instance, kurinci evokes clandestine love amid mountainous hunting societies, while marutam depicts marital discord in agricultural plains. This integration demonstrates early Tamils' environmental knowledge, passed down to understand socio-economic activities like pastoralism and trade.



Medieval commentators, such as Ilampūranar (10th century) and Naccinārrkiniyar (14th century), expanded on the \*Tolkāppiyam\*, debating Sanskrit influences. Some scholars argue for minimal borrowings, asserting Tamil's independence, while others note Sanskrit terms like \*vadasol\*. Interpolations in the \*Poruḷatikāram\* may reflect later Sanskrit dominance, but the text minimizes such influences, systematizing borrowings. The tradition's educational method involved small groups (\*paḷḷi\*) under teachers (\*āśiriyar\*), relying on memory and palm-leaf manuscripts, without formal institutions.



This grammatical tradition fostered literacy and literary production, enabling the comprehension of Sangam anthologies. It influenced later grammars and lexicons (\*nigaṇṭu\*), standardizing Tamil against external pressures. By emphasizing semantics tied to real-world contexts, it bridged language with culture, making it a cornerstone of Tamil knowledge production. Its legacy endures in modern Tamil linguistics, highlighting how early efforts preserved a Dravidian identity amid Aryan influences.



2. Poetic and Literary Tradition



The poetic and literary tradition in Tamil emerges prominently through the Sangam anthologies, comprising \*Eṭṭuttokai\* (eight anthologies) and \*Pattuppāṭṭu\* (ten long poems), dated roughly from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD. These works, themed around \*akaṁ\* and \*puraṁ\*, represent the earliest literary expressions, blending artistry with social commentary. Unlike didactic texts, they focus on human emotions, warfare, and patronage, reflecting a tribal society's worldview without overt philosophical undertones.



Composed by bards (\*pāṇar\*) and poets (\*pulavar\*), possibly including Brāhmiṇs, Jains, and Buddhists, the poems were collected under Pāṇḍya patronage at Madurai's legendary academy. This ""Sangam"" symbolized peer recognition over royal fiat, legitimizing chiefly lineages. \*Akaṁ\* poems explore interior love in five \*tiṇai\*, using symbolic landscapes: a lover's union in mullai evokes pastoral serenity, while separation in pālai mirrors arid hardship. These metaphors draw from ecology, implying knowledge of regional livelihoods—hunting in hills, fishing in coasts.



\*Puraṁ\* poems glorify war, heroism, and patronage, depicting tribal conflicts for hegemony. References to chieftains like the Pāṇḍyas, Cōḻas, and Cēras highlight socio-political dynamics, with bards seeking gifts. Poems like those in \*Puraṉāṉūṟu\* praise valor, while \*Maturaikkāñci\* mentions Jain monasteries, indicating early religious presence without deep societal impact. Astrological knowledge appears in works by poets like Kaṇiyan Pūṅkuṉṟaṉ.



The tradition's poetics, formalized in \*Tolkāppiyam\*'s \*Poruḷatikāram\*, includes figures of speech, prosody, and conventions. It classifies emotions and behaviors, incorporating psychology—e.g., lovers' quarrels or warriors' ethics. This sui generis classification distinguishes Tamil poetry from Sanskrit, emphasizing humanism over metaphysics.



Post-Sangam shifts introduced ethical tones, but the core tradition preserved oral creativity, later committed to writing. It influenced epics like \*Cilappatikāram\*, blending narrative with poetry. By capturing eco-cultural zones, it disseminated environmental knowledge, aiding historical reconstructions. The tradition's enduring appeal lies in its vivid portrayal of life, making abstract knowledge tangible through verse.



3. Didactic and Ethical Tradition



The didactic and ethical tradition flourishes in the \*Patiṇeṇkīlkaṇakku\* (eighteen minor works), dated to the post-Sangam period (4th-6th centuries AD), marking a transition to moral instruction influenced by Jainism and Buddhism. These works shift from Sangam humanism to ethics, social norms, and spirituality, reflecting socio-economic changes like urbanization and religious spread.



Comprising short poems and aphorisms, they guide conduct for householders and ascetics. \*Tirukkuṟaḷ\*, attributed to Tiruvaḷḷuvar (possibly Jain), is a tripartite text on virtue (\*aṟam\*), wealth (\*poruḷ\*), and love (\*kāmam\*), with 1,330 couplets. It emphasizes non-violence (\*ahiṁsā\*), truth, and charity, universal in appeal. Verses like ""avisorindāyiram vēṭṭalin oṇṟaṉ uyiṟ cekuttuṇṇāmai naṉṟu"" prioritize life preservation over rituals, echoing Jain ideals.



\*Nālaṭiyār\*, compiled by Padumaṉār, called ""Vēḷālar Vēdam,"" stresses transience, karma, and renunciation. Its quatrains promote righteousness, influencing household wisdom. Other works like \*Palamoḻi\* and \*Āṟaṉeṟiccāram\* outline Jain principles: non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy, non-possession.



Some retain Sangam themes, like \*Tīṉaimālai Nūṟṟaimpatu\*, but overall, they introduce Sanskrit loanwords and metaphysical ideas, eroding anthropocentric views. Authored mostly by Jains, they reflect sectarian dominance in urban centers, promoting ethical behavior amid trade growth.



This tradition educated through memorization, fostering societal norms. It bridged literature and philosophy, influencing later bhakti works, and remains a moral compass in Tamil culture.



4. Medical Tradition



The medical tradition in early Tamil knowledge emerges in didactic works, linked to Jain ascetics and indigenous practices, precursor to Siddha medicine. References in \*Ēlāti\*, \*Tirikkaṭukam\*, and \*Ciṟupañcamūlam\* equate herbs to ethical remedies, drawing from Āyurveda but adapting locally.



\*Ēlāti\* by Kaṇimētai-y-ar uses six herbs (cardamom, cloves, pepper, ginger, etc.) as metaphors for moral cures. \*Tirikkaṭukam\* prescribes three (\*cukku\*, \*milaku\*, \*tippili\*) for spiritual ills. \*Ciṟupañcamūlam\* references five roots for intellectual ailments.



These indicate Jain-developed herbal knowledge, familiar to Tamils by the 4th-6th centuries. Siddhas, from the 8th century, advanced this into Siddha-vaidyam, focusing on immortality via alchemy and yoga. The tradition's anti-Vedic stance aligned with Jain-Buddhist views, emphasizing holistic health.



It disseminated practical medicine, influencing daily life and later systems, blending empiricism with ethics.



5. Mathematical and Astronomical Tradition



Mentioned as core subjects in early education, this tradition supported practical needs like trade and agriculture. Taught alongside grammar, it involved basic arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy for calendars and navigation.



References in Sangam poems to astrology (e.g., Kaṇiyan Pūṅkuṉṟaṉ) suggest predictive knowledge. No extant texts from this era, but palm-leaf manuscripts preserved formulas. It aided eco-zone management, like irrigation in marutam.



Influenced by Jain-Buddhist cosmologies, it evolved into precise tools, foundational for medieval advancements.



6. Philosophical and Religious Tradition



Introduced via Jainism and Buddhism from the Mauryan period, this tradition appears in epics and didactic works. \*Cilappatikāram\* and \*Maṇimēkalai\* discuss karma, impermanence, and philosophies: Vedic, Ajīvika, Jain, Sāṅkhya, etc.



Jains emphasized asceticism, influencing ethics; Buddhists, compassion. They challenged Brāhmiṇical norms, promoting rational inquiry.



This tradition spiritualized Tamil knowledge, integrating with literature for broader dissemination.



In conclusion, these traditions interwove to form a robust knowledge ecosystem, adapting to societal needs.

Champakalakshmi, R. In Search of the Beginnings and Growth of Knowledge Production in Tamil, Indian Journal of History of Science, 51.1 (2016) 118-124.",evolution of knowledge systems in early tamil literature and culture the exploration of knowledge production in tamil language literature and culture reveals a rich tapestry of intellectual development that spans from the early historical period to the transitional phases influenced by religious and social changes this journey begins with the sangam poems which capture the essence of early tamil society through themes of love and war and extends to grammatical treatises didactic works and emerging scientific insights the foundational texts not only preserved linguistic norms but also embedded social ethical and environmental knowledge reflecting the needs of a society transitioning from tribal structures to more organized formations influenced by indigenous traditions and external elements from jainism buddhism and sanskrit sources these knowledge systems laid the groundwork for tamil intellectual heritage by examining the key traditions mentioned in historical analyses we can appreciate how early tamils systematized their understanding of language morality medicine mathematics and philosophy the knowledge traditions in early tamil culture can be categorized as follows grammatical and linguistic tradition poetic and literary tradition didactic and ethical tradition medical tradition mathematical and astronomical tradition philosophical and religious tradition each of these traditions contributed uniquely to the growth of knowledge often intertwining with socio economic shifts and religious influences below we delve into each in detail exploring their origins key texts methodologies and impacts on tamil society grammatical and linguistic tradition the grammatical and linguistic tradition in tamil represents one of the earliest formalized knowledge systems aimed at standardizing language for literary and communicative purposes at its core is the tolk ppiyam recognized as the oldest extant work on tamil grammar dating variably from the nd century bc to the th century ad with recent epigraphic evidence supporting a nd century date based on its alignment with early tamil br hmi inscriptions this text is not merely a grammatical manual but a comprehensive framework that established the basis for tamil linguistics influencing subsequent works and serving as a guide to interpreting ancient literature the tolk ppiyam is structured into three main sections eluttatik ram orthography or phonology sollatik ram etymology morphology and syntax and poru atik ram semantics poetics and conventions this tripartite division comprising chapters and s tras reflects a methodical approach to language analysis the eluttatik ram deals with the sounds and letters of tamil categorizing them into vowels consonants and their combinations emphasizing phonetic accuracy essential for oral transmission in a pre institutional educational setup this section underscores the importance of precise articulation which was crucial in a society where knowledge was passed orally from teacher to student the sollatik ram explores word formation including roots suffixes and syntactic rules systematizing how words convey meaning in context it addresses case endings verb conjugations and nominal derivations providing rules that ensure clarity and consistency in expression this morphological focus highlights the tradition s emphasis on cognitive development prioritizing intellectual outcomes over rote learning tolk ppiyar the attributed author drew inspiration from an earlier non extant work akattiyam attributed to the sage agastya suggesting a lineage of grammatical scholarship the most innovative aspect is the poru atik ram which interprets meaning through literary conventions psychology and social norms it classifies themes into aka interior love and pura exterior war or public life linking them to ti ai eco zones that integrate geography environment and human behavior the seven ti ai kurinci for hills mullai for forests marutam for plains neytal for coasts p lai for deserts plus two additional for mismatched love represent situational contexts blending linguistics with ecology for instance kurinci evokes clandestine love amid mountainous hunting societies while marutam depicts marital discord in agricultural plains this integration demonstrates early tamils environmental knowledge passed down to understand socio economic activities like pastoralism and trade medieval commentators such as ilamp ranar th century and naccin rrkiniyar th century expanded on the tolk ppiyam debating sanskrit influences some scholars argue for minimal borrowings asserting tamil s independence while others note sanskrit terms like vadasol interpolations in the poru atik ram may reflect later sanskrit dominance but the text minimizes such influences systematizing borrowings the tradition s educational method involved small groups pa i under teachers iriyar relying on memory and palm leaf manuscripts without formal institutions this grammatical tradition fostered literacy and literary production enabling the comprehension of sangam anthologies it influenced later grammars and lexicons niga u standardizing tamil against external pressures by emphasizing semantics tied to real world contexts it bridged language with culture making it a cornerstone of tamil knowledge production its legacy endures in modern tamil linguistics highlighting how early efforts preserved a dravidian identity amid aryan influences poetic and literary tradition the poetic and literary tradition in tamil emerges prominently through the sangam anthologies comprising e uttokai eight anthologies and pattupp u ten long poems dated roughly from the rd century bc to the rd century ad these works themed around aka and pura represent the earliest literary expressions blending artistry with social commentary unlike didactic texts they focus on human emotions warfare and patronage reflecting a tribal society s worldview without overt philosophical undertones composed by bards p ar and poets pulavar possibly including br hmi s jains and buddhists the poems were collected under p ya patronage at madurai s legendary academy this sangam symbolized peer recognition over royal fiat legitimizing chiefly lineages aka poems explore interior love in five ti ai using symbolic landscapes a lover s union in mullai evokes pastoral serenity while separation in p lai mirrors arid hardship these metaphors draw from ecology implying knowledge of regional livelihoods hunting in hills fishing in coasts pura poems glorify war heroism and patronage depicting tribal conflicts for hegemony references to chieftains like the p yas c as and c ras highlight socio political dynamics with bards seeking gifts poems like those in pura u praise valor while maturaikk ci mentions jain monasteries indicating early religious presence without deep societal impact astrological knowledge appears in works by poets like ka iyan p ku a the tradition s poetics formalized in tolk ppiyam s poru atik ram includes figures of speech prosody and conventions it classifies emotions and behaviors incorporating psychology e g lovers quarrels or warriors ethics this sui generis classification distinguishes tamil poetry from sanskrit emphasizing humanism over metaphysics post sangam shifts introduced ethical tones but the core tradition preserved oral creativity later committed to writing it influenced epics like cilappatik ram blending narrative with poetry by capturing eco cultural zones it disseminated environmental knowledge aiding historical reconstructions the tradition s enduring appeal lies in its vivid portrayal of life making abstract knowledge tangible through verse didactic and ethical tradition the didactic and ethical tradition flourishes in the pati e k lka akku eighteen minor works dated to the post sangam period th th centuries ad marking a transition to moral instruction influenced by jainism and buddhism these works shift from sangam humanism to ethics social norms and spirituality reflecting socio economic changes like urbanization and religious spread comprising short poems and aphorisms they guide conduct for householders and ascetics tirukku a attributed to tiruva uvar possibly jain is a tripartite text on virtue a am wealth poru and love k mam with couplets it emphasizes non violence ahi s truth and charity universal in appeal verses like avisorind yiram v alin o a uyi cekuttu mai na u prioritize life preservation over rituals echoing jain ideals n la iy r compiled by paduma r called v lar v dam stresses transience karma and renunciation its quatrains promote righteousness influencing household wisdom other works like palamo i and a e icc ram outline jain principles non violence truth non stealing celibacy non possession some retain sangam themes like t aim lai n aimpatu but overall they introduce sanskrit loanwords and metaphysical ideas eroding anthropocentric views authored mostly by jains they reflect sectarian dominance in urban centers promoting ethical behavior amid trade growth this tradition educated through memorization fostering societal norms it bridged literature and philosophy influencing later bhakti works and remains a moral compass in tamil culture medical tradition the medical tradition in early tamil knowledge emerges in didactic works linked to jain ascetics and indigenous practices precursor to siddha medicine references in l ti tirikka ukam and ci upa cam lam equate herbs to ethical remedies drawing from yurveda but adapting locally l ti by ka im tai y ar uses six herbs cardamom cloves pepper ginger etc as metaphors for moral cures tirikka ukam prescribes three cukku milaku tippili for spiritual ills ci upa cam lam references five roots for intellectual ailments these indicate jain developed herbal knowledge familiar to tamils by the th th centuries siddhas from the th century advanced this into siddha vaidyam focusing on immortality via alchemy and yoga the tradition s anti vedic stance aligned with jain buddhist views emphasizing holistic health it disseminated practical medicine influencing daily life and later systems blending empiricism with ethics mathematical and astronomical tradition mentioned as core subjects in early education this tradition supported practical needs like trade and agriculture taught alongside grammar it involved basic arithmetic geometry and astronomy for calendars and navigation references in sangam poems to astrology e g ka iyan p ku a suggest predictive knowledge no extant texts from this era but palm leaf manuscripts preserved formulas it aided eco zone management like irrigation in marutam influenced by jain buddhist cosmologies it evolved into precise tools foundational for medieval advancements philosophical and religious tradition introduced via jainism and buddhism from the mauryan period this tradition appears in epics and didactic works cilappatik ram and ma im kalai discuss karma impermanence and philosophies vedic aj vika jain s khya etc jains emphasized asceticism influencing ethics buddhists compassion they challenged br hmi ical norms promoting rational inquiry this tradition spiritualized tamil knowledge integrating with literature for broader dissemination in conclusion these traditions interwove to form a robust knowledge ecosystem adapting to societal needs sources champakalakshmi r
